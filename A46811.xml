            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving but a very few years ſince publiſhed, for the good of thoſe that deſire to reade the Scripture with underſtanding, <hi>Certain ſhort Notes of Expoſition upon the five books of Moſes,</hi> and finding that they have been entertained by many with farre greater eſteem and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation then ever I expected, or they deſerved: I have now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to ſend forth the reſt after them, which I had then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by me; to wit, the like Notes upon the remaining hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part of the old Teſtament, and indeed I did then in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner engage my ſelf by promiſe, that if thoſe found welcome, theſe ere long ſhould follow after; and having been often ſince preſſed to make good that promiſe, by the importunity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian friends, but eſpecially thoſe of my reverend bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Miniſtery, whoſe judgement I prized above mine
<pb facs="tcp:42229:2"/>
own, there lay an obligation upon me for the ſatisfying of their deſires, which I could not gainſay.</p>
            <p>Now as the firſt part of theſe Annotations I did then dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to that particular congregation, which the Lord hath been pleaſed to commit to my care, ſo this ſecond part I now make bold to preſent unto you, who above twenty years ſince were alſo pleaſed to chooſe me to diſpenſe the word of grace unto you, at ſome ſet times of your ſolemn meetings; and whom in many other reſpects I have great cauſe to love and honour. It were indeed engagement enough, if there were nothing elſe, to endear my affections to this worthy Society, that my dear father, (whoſe memory is precious with me) and both his brothers were whileſt they lived, members of this Company, and in their times too honoured with thoſe places of credit and truſt, which ſince your ſelves have ſeverally born. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this it is well known, how much I owe you (and I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly thus declare it, that this may remain as a publick teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my thankfulneſſe to you) not onely for the great love and reſpect you have ever ſhown to me upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but alſo eſpecially for the bounteous ſupport which for divers years you have been pleaſed to afford to one of mine for my ſake.</p>
            <p>Adde therefore, I beſeech you, to your former favours, the gracious acceptance of this piece of my labours; and the God of all grace improve it to you, for your ſpirituall advantage. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of former times have been ever acknowledged both moſt pleaſant, and moſt profitable, (if a faire proſpect from a high hill be ſo pleaſing to the eye, how pleaſant muſt it needs be to the mind of man, to have the memorable paſſages of ancient times preſented to our view in a fair proſpect of Hiſtory, as if we had then lived to ſee thoſe things done?) But above all, it muſt needs be thus in the Hiſtory of the Scripture; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:42229:2"/>
this chiefly acquaints us with the diſpenſations of Gods providence towards his Church, <hi>the dearly beloved of his ſoul,</hi> in compariſon of whom, the reſt of the world is not worth the regarding, and likewiſe, becauſe this was written by the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pen of men inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, and that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely too (as the Apoſtle ſaith,) <hi>for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> But what need I commend to you the uſefulneſſe of any part of Gods word, which I hope you eſteem with David, above <hi>thouſands of Gold and ſilver?</hi> If theſe Annotations ſhall afford any help for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſuch paſſages in theſe books, as may ſeem at firſt ſomewhat intricate and obſcure, I have my deſire. My prayer ſhall ever be for this worthy Company, that <hi>the word of Christ may dwell in you richly in all wiſdome,</hi> and that God would ſtill raiſe up many amongſt you, that may be to others patterns of piety and zeal for Gods truth, in this honourable City; and ſo I reſt,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat I prefixed by way of Preface before my Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the five books of Moſes, may ſerve alſo for theſe upon the remaining Hiſtoricall part of the old Testament, theſe being carried on in the ſame manner, and with reſpect unto the ſame ends as the other were: Onely one thing I thought good to adde here, which is this, that there are ſome Expoſitions, which as I went along, I met with ſo often in ſo many ſeverall places (ſuch as that where men deſperately wicked are termed <hi>children of Belial,</hi> and that where the Church is called the <hi>Lords portion,</hi> and <hi>the Lords inheritance,</hi> and ſome other of the like nature) that I was at laſt wearied with referring the Reader ſo often to thoſe places where I had formerly given the grounds of thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſo reſolved (to avoid the tedium of ſuch reiterated references) rather to leave every man by himſelf to conſider where the like expreſsion was formerly uſed, which by the help of a Concordance at leaſt may be eaſily found, that ſo there he might ſeek for ſatisfaction herein.</p>
            <p>Further then this I have not at preſent to advertiſe you concerning theſe Notes; but am onely now to deſire your favourable acceptance of what is here publiſhed. Indeed when the late Annotations came forth upon the whole Bible, compoſed by divers worthy Divines, authorized thereto by command of Parliament, I did at firſt question whether there would now be any need of theſe: But conſidering with my ſelf, firſt, that thoſe for the most part are very brief, as being at first intended onely for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall notes: ſecondly, that there are very few Expoſitours that have
<pb facs="tcp:42229:4"/>
written upon this part of the Bible, and therefore a ſupply of further help herein could not be thought altogether uſeleſſe: and thirdly, that I was in ſome ſort already engaged by promiſe for theſe Annotations, which I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made known were then collected, I did at last in theſe regards determine to proceed in my former reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Whether I ſhall ever go on any further in this way, the Lord onely knows, the infirmities of age grow ſo faſt upon me, that I may well fear I ſhall not. And beſides, there is little encouragement for any work of this nature, in theſe contentious times. There are ſome we ſee riſen up amongſt us, that are not afraid to deny the Scriptures to be Gods word, which muſt needs be the ruine of religion, and open a doore to all profaneneſſe and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, ſhould it be ſuffered in the land. But we truſt the Magistrate whom God hath ſo highly honoured, will be ſo zealous for the honour of God, as ere long to ſtop the mouthes of ſuch blaſphemers; and in the mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, none but thoſe that are given up of God to believe lies, will ever a whit the more queſtion theſe divine Oracles. Surely, the Scripture is the Churches <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> whereon all our priviledges and all our hopes depend as we are Chriſtians, and therefore I hope none that profeſſe themſelves fellow-citizens of the ſaints, will ſuffer ſuch a treaſure as this to be taken from them: No, but the more violently Satan rageth againſt it, the more we ſhould prize it, and the more diligently we ſhould exerciſe our ſelves in the ſtudy of it. Now Reader if herein this which I ſend forth abroad for the good of the Church, ſhall afford thee any help, bleſſe God for it, and pray for him, who is</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow after the death of Moſes the ſervant of the Lord, it came to paſſe that the Lord spake unto Joſhua,</hi> &amp;c.] Here begins the hiſtory of Iſraels commonwealth under the government of Joſhua; and therefore is this book called <hi>the book of Joſhua.</hi> Some adde alſo, that it was ſo called becauſe it was written by Joſhua; which may be judged the more probable, firſt, becauſe the example of Moſes herein, who wrote the State of Iſraels common-wealth in his time, might be a ſtrong inducement to Joſhua to do the like: and ſecondly, becauſe that place, chap 24.26. <hi>And Joſhua wrote theſe words in the book of the Law of God,</hi> &amp;c. is an evident proof that he wrote ſome part of this book, if not that he wrote it all. It is true, there are ſome paſſages in this book which could not be written by Joſhua; as 1. That mention which is made of the book of Jaſher, Chap. 10.13. <hi>And the Sunne ſtood still, and the Moon ſtayed untill the people had avenged themſelves upon their enemies. Is not this writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of Jaſher?</hi> for this book of Jaſher was written after Davids time, as is evident, 2. Sam. 1.18. where it is ſaid, that <hi>David bid them teach the children of Judah the uſe of the bow; behold it was written in the book of Jaſher.</hi> 2. That ſtory of the expedition of the Danites when they took Laiſh, mentioned in this book of Joſhua, chap. 19.47. which was long after that, Judges 18.1. &amp;c. and 3. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Joſhua his death and buriall, chap. 24.29, 30. Theſe things, and ſome others that might be picked out could not indeed be written by Joſhua; but though the book it ſelf were written by Joſhua, yet theſe paſſages might be inſerted afterwards by ſome other Penman of the holy Ghoſt: for ſo alſo in the foregoing books which all men yield were written by Moſes, we find ſome paſſages too, that could not be written by Moſes himſelf, but were afterwards added by ſome other, as is noted upon that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the death &amp; buriall of Moſes, Deut. 34.5. &amp;c. However, ſufficient it is for us to know, that whoever wrote this book he wrote it by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt; for hereto there is a teſtimonie given in the new Teſtament, where ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages thereof are cited as parts of the ſacred Scripture, the word of God; as that which in this chapter is ſpoken to Joſhua, and cited by S. Paul, Heb. 13.5. <hi>I will never leave
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42229:6"/>
thee nor forſake thee.</hi> As for this firſt paſſage wherewith this book begins, it ſhews how Joſhua received a command from God to lead the Iſraelites over Jordan into the land of Canaan; the Lord had before appointed that Joſhua ſhould ſucceed Moſes in the government of Iſrael, Numb. 27.18. and upon the laying of Moſes hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he had received an extraordinary meaſure of the gifts of Gods ſpirit to ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him for the government, Deut. 34.9. And therefore doubtleſſe immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of Moſes, Joſhua took upon him the ſupreme Magiſtracy: But here now we are told how either at that time ſo ſoon as Moſes was dead, or rather after the thirty dayes that were ſpent in lamenting the death of Moſes, Deut. 34.8. <hi>the Lord spake unto Joſhua the ſonne of Nun, Moſes miniſter,</hi> and gave him that charge which is here after related. Whether God ſpake this to Joſhua by an audible voice, by the ſecret inſtinct of his ſpirit, in ſome dream or viſion, or by the high-prieſts inquiring for him by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> we cannot conclude, becauſe we find it not expreſſed, onely we find that God had formerly promiſed that Eleazar the prieſt ſhould ask counſel for him after the judgement of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> before the Lord, Num. 27.21. But for this title given here to Joſhua, that he was Moſes miniſter, <hi>the Lord ſpake unto Joſhua, Moſes miniſter;</hi> we may well think that was purpoſely added to imply one reaſon amongſt others, why Joſhua was moſt fit to ſucceed Moſes in the government, to wit, becauſe having been ſo many years together his miniſter, by his continuall &amp; daily converſation with Moſes he could not but learn much thereby to prepare and fit him the better for this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Moſes my ſervant is dead, now therefore ariſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Lord exhorts Joſhua, that ſince Moſes was dead, he ſhould now lead the Iſraelites over Jordan, and carry them into the land, which according to his former promiſes made to their fathers, he was now ready to conferre upon them. Now in mentioning the death of Moſes he uſeth this expreſſion, <hi>Moſes my ſervant is dead;</hi> firſt, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, to imply what it was he required of him, to wit, that as their captain and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme governour he ſhould now conduct them into the land of Canaan, for Moſes is here called Gods <hi>ſervant,</hi> in regard of the ſupreme magiſtracy whereto God had advanced him, and ſo the drift of the words is, that ſince Moſes their governour was dead, he ſhould now as his ſucceſſour go before the people in his ſtead: ſecondly, to imply, that as Moſes in his magiſtracy was ſubordinate to Gods will, and was onely to do all things according to his direction, ſo muſt it be with Joſhua too: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by ſpeaking thus honourably of Moſes, <hi>Moſes my ſervant,</hi> Joſhua might be encouraged faithfully to ſerve God in his place, as Moſes had done, that he alſo might gain ſuch favour and eſteem with God as Moſes had gained.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Every place that the ſole of your foot ſhall tread upon, that have I given unto you,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, every place in the land formerly promiſed them, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and bounded in the following words, firſt, <hi>by the wilderneſſe</hi> that they had paſſed through, which was their South bound; ſecondly, the mountain <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and <hi>the great river, the river Euphrates,</hi> which was their North border, and thirdly, <hi>the great Sea,</hi> that is, the midland-ſea, which was their Weſt border; as for their Eaſtern border that is not here mentioned; becauſe the Iſraelites were now at the Eaſt ſide of the land, and the drift of theſe words was onely to ſhew Joſhua how
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42229:6"/>
farre the land he would give them ſhould reach every where from the place where they now were. Indeed, that the Iſraelites did never extend the bounds of the land thus farre, is evident: for though in Davids and Solomons time all the nations as farre as Euphrates became tributaries to the crown of Iſrael, 1. Kings 4.21. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon raigned over all kingdomes from the river,</hi> (that is, the great river Euphrates) <hi>unto the land of the Philiſtines, and unto the border of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. yet they never deſtroyed the inhabitants there, and planted themſelves in their countrey as they did in the land of Canaan: and therefore in that place before cited, ver 25. the land of Iſrael is ſaid to reach onely from Dan to Beerſheba as formerly. But the reaſon of this was, becauſe the people of Iſrael failed in keeping covenant with God, and it was onely upon condition of their obedience, that God promiſed thus farre to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their borders.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>As I was with Moſes ſo I will be with thee,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe words the Lord doth not onely promiſe Joſhua to aſſiſt him as he had aſſiſted Moſes, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all likewiſe by putting him in mind of the great things he had done for Moſes, he doth covertly encourage him againſt the fear of thoſe mighty nations with whom he was to encounter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Be ſtrong and of a good courage,</hi> &amp;c.] We find this often preſſed upon Joſhua, firſt by Moſes, Deut. 31.7. <hi>And Moſes called unto Joſhua and ſaid unto him, in the ſight of all Iſrael, Be ſtrong and of a good courage,</hi> &amp;c. for which he had a ſpeciall command from God, Deut. 1.38. and 3.28. <hi>Charge Joſhua, and encourage him, and ſtrengthen him,</hi> &amp;c. ſecondly, by the Lord himſelf, Deut. 31.23. and ſo again three ſeverall times in this chapter here, and verſ. 7. and verſ. 9. and laſt of all, by the people. And why was this? not becauſe Joſhua had diſcovered any faintheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe or cowardiſe; but firſt, becauſe the work he was to undertake was ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perillous, and that not onely in regard of thoſe many and mighty nations whom he was to deſtroy and plant the Iſraelites in their room, but eſpecially alſo in regard of the ſtubbornneſſe of the people whom he was to govern, of whoſe rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Moſes, yea againſt God, he had often been an eye-witneſſe: ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord knew well that Joſhua had humble and low thoughts of himſelf, and feared much his inſufficiency for ſo great a charge, as indeed the wiſer and the more able men are, the more jealous they are of themſelves in ſuch caſes: and thirdly, becauſe even thoſe that are beſt reſolved do yet need to be quickned and ſtirred up; and that principally, leſt they ſhould ſhrink from doing exactly what God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them for fear of any difficulty that may lie in their way: of which God gives Joſhua ſpeciall warning in the following verſe, <hi>Onely be thou ſtrong and very cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do according to all the Law which Moſes my ſervant commanded thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For unto this people ſhalt thou divide for an inheritance, the land,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, this I have appointed to be thy honour, and therefore be not afraid to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the charge. And indeed this was the principall thing wherein Joſhua was a type of Chriſt; Moſes did not carry the Iſraelites into the land of Canaan, but Moſes being dead Joſhua did it: ſo neither could the Law carry us into the heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; for by the righteouſneſſe of the Law can no man be ſaved: but Chriſt, our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42229:7"/>
Jeſus, our Saviour hath by his merits opened a way for us into the heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, and is gone before to prepare a place for us, John 14.2, 3. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, there you may be alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Turn not from it to the right hand, or to the left, that thou mayest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper whitherſoever thou goeſt.]</hi> If we reade the words as it is in our Bibles, then there is here a promiſe implyed, That if Joſhua did ſtrictly obſerve Gods law, not yielding any way to turn aſide from that rule, he ſhould proſper in every thing that he undertook. But if we reade the laſt clauſe as it is in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>that thou mayest do wiſely whitherſoever thou goeſt;</hi> then the drift of theſe words muſt be, either to give Joſhua to underſtand, that it would be his greateſt wiſdome to do in all things as God in his Law had enjoyned him, whatever his own reaſon might ſuggeſt to the contrary; which agrees with that of the Prophet, Jer. 8.9. <hi>They have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wiſdome is in them?</hi> Or elſe, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, that if he did ſincerely obſerve to do all things according to Gods law, then the Lord would more abundantly poure forth the ſpirit of wiſdome upon him; which agreeth with that of David, Pſal. 25.12. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe:</hi> and that of our Saviour, Matth. 13.12. <hi>Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>This book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth,</hi> &amp;c.] The book of the Law which Moſes wrote, was delivered to the Levites, to be laid up by them in the ſide of the ark, Deut. 31.25, 26. it was therefore a copy of this law, whereof the Lord here ſpake to Joſhua, <hi>This book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth;</hi> and the meaning of this is, that by frequent and continuall reading and conference, he ſhould labour to be ſo expert in it, that in all his judgements he ſhould be able readily to judge as it was in that Law determined, and in all other things to order himſelf according to the directions which were there given.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Prepare you victuals, for within three dayes you ſhall paſſe over Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.]</hi> For though as yet they had that manna from heaven, yet where other meat might be had, they were not debarred the eating of it. See Deut. 2.6. Now though the ſtory of the ſpies that were ſent to view Jericho, be related in the following chapter, yet doubtleſſe this charge given by the Officers to the people, for preparing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls for themſelves againſt they were to paſſe over Jordan, was given them after they were returned from Jericho. For this charge was given but <hi>three dayes</hi> before they were to go over Jordan, and the ſpies ſtayed three daies in the mountains for fear of thoſe that purſued them as they returned from Jericho, chap. 2.22.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>But ye ſhall paſſe before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.]</hi> That is, you ſhall paſſe over Jordan together with your brethren, and all that paſſe over ſhall be mighty men of valour, or of the prime choice of your armies: for that Joſhua left garriſons in every city of theſe tribes for the guard of thoſe they left behind them, is evident. See Numb. 32.21.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>According as we hearkned to Moſes in all things, ſo will we hearken unto thee.]</hi> That is, as we acknowledged Moſes and obeyed him as our ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42229:7"/>
ſo will we likewiſe obey thee. Nor need we wonder that they ſhould thus expreſſe themſelves, becauſe of the frequent rebellion of this people againſt Moſes: For firſt, that mutinous generation were all deſtroyed in the wilderneſſe, and it was their poſterity, that had been more obſequious to Moſes, that made this promiſe. And ſecondly, even the people formerly had ordinarily yielded obedience to Moſes, though now and then they brake into rebellion againſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Onely the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moſes.]</hi> That is, the Lord proſper thee in all thy proceedings and attempts, as he proſpered Moſes: and this they adde, either onely by occaſion of the mention they had made of Moſes in the former words, the high &amp; precious eſteem they alwayes had of him cauſing them thus abruptly to break forth into this wiſh or prayer, That the Lord would be with him as he was with Moſes; or elſe, to intimate an acknowledgment, that however they would be ready to go over with their brethren, and aid them againſt the inhabitans of Canaan; yet it was not ſo much their help as the Lords help that muſt make them victorious: We will, ſay they, paſſe over Jordan, and do in all things what thou ſhalt enjoyn us, onely the Lord, that wrought ſo great things for us under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Moſes, afford us the ſame aſſiſtance and favour under thy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Joſhua the ſonne of Nun ſent out of Shittim two men, to ſpie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſaying, Go view the land even Jericho.]</hi> That is, the citie of Jericho, and the land about it. This Joſhua did before he gave that charge to the people which is related in the former chapter, verſ. 10. though it be here inſerted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, as is there noted. Conſidering what a miſchief formerly followed upon Moſes his ſending forth of ſpies to ſearch the land, Deut. 1.27, 28. it may ſeem ſtrange that Joſhua durſt take this courſe again: but therefore it is moſt probable that Joſhua did not this without ſome ſpeciall direction from God; and then no wonder it is, though this ſucceeded well when that did not; for that proceeded firſt from a motion made by the people, out of ſome ſecret fear and diſtruſt, as is noted upon Numb. 13.2. but here now the people had no hand in it; and therefore there were not now twelve chief men choſen for this ſervice out of all the tribes, as there were then, but Joſhua onely choſe two men whom he knew able and fit for this imployment, and theſe two he ſent away ſecretly without the knowledge of the people (for that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is implyed in this word <hi>ſecretly;</hi> not onely that they were ordered to carry themſelves cloſely and cunningly, perhaps in ſome diſguiſe, that they might not be diſcovered, which all ſpies are wont to do, but alſo that they were ſent away privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any knowledge of the people, that ſo the buſineſſe might be carried the more covertly) and therefore we ſee alſo that when theſe ſpies returned, they gave an account of what they had done onely to Joſhua, verſ. 23, 24. whenas thoſe that Moſes ſent returned their anſwer <hi>to all the Congregation,</hi> Numb. 13.26. However, if Joſhua had not a ſpeciall direction from God for the doing of this, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he did it not out of any ſecret diſtruſt or fear, but out of a neceſſary providence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42229:8"/>
that became a Generall, that he might the better know what courſe to take when they were gotten over into Canaan. For though God had aſſured him that he ſhould drive out the inhabitants of the land, yet he knew that God expected that he ſhould uſe all requiſite means that might conduce thereto, and therefore intending firſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt Jericho, which was the neareſt city of note to the river Jordan, he ſent ſpies thither to view the city and land about it, to ſee how it was fortified, of what ſtrength and courage the people were, what preparations the inhabitants had made to reſiſt them, and which way they might beſt paſſe into the city.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they went and came into an harlots houſe named Rahab,</hi> &amp;c.] In paſſing from Shittim to Jericho, they muſt needs paſſe over Jordan, which they might do by thoſe foords mentioned, verſ. 7. <hi>And the men purſued after them the way to Jordan unto the foords:</hi> and again, Judg. 3.28. As for their taking up their lodging in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs houſe when they came to Jericho, this they did, either becauſe in her houſe built upon the town wall, verſ. 15. they might the more conveniently view the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications and ſtrength of the city, or becauſe in ſuch an obſcure corner they might be the better concealed, and were not ſo likely to be diſcovered; or becauſe thence they might moſt conveniently ſlip away, if they ſhould be diſcovered. The Hebrew word here tranſlated <hi>an harlot,</hi> is by ſome tranſlated <hi>an hoſteſſe</hi> or <hi>victualler:</hi> but every where elſe ſignifieth an <hi>harlot,</hi> and is ſo here taken by the Apoſtles teſtimony, Heb. 11.31. <hi>By faith the Harlot Rahab periſhed not with them that believed not.</hi> James 2.25. <hi>Likewiſe alſo, was not Rahab the harlot juſtified by works?</hi> whence it was perhaps that verſ. 13. amongſt thoſe whoſe lives ſhe pleads for, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neither of husband nor children, though ſhe lived in a houſe apart from her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet was this woman by the ſpeciall grace of God not onely wonne to embrace the faith of Iſrael, and to joyn her ſelf to Gods people; but beſides, after her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſhe was married to Salmon a Prince of the tribe of Judah, and ſo was of the ſtock of whom David, yea Chriſt deſcended, Matth. 1.5. a notable inſtance of the freedome of Gods grace, to ſhew mercy to them that are moſt unworthy of it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Behold there came men in hither to night of the children of Iſrael, to ſearch out the countrey.]</hi> That is, late in the evening, that ſo they might the better paſſe undiſcerned; and indeed their ſudden diſcovery makes it probable that it was by watchmen, purpoſely ſet to obſerve thoſe that came into the city, as in dangerous times they uſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the woman took the two men and hid them.]</hi> To wit, either before the meſſengers of the King came to her houſe, having heard ſome muttering of the buſineſſe amongſt her neighbours, or whileſt they knocked at her gates perceiving them to be meſſengers ſent from the King. And this was that noble act of faith, for which Rahab is ſo highly extolled in the Scriptures: Heb. 11.13. <hi>By faith the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot Rahab periſhed not with them that believed not, when ſhe had received the ſpies with peace.</hi> Having heard of the great things which God had done for the Iſraelites, by a ſpeciall and extraordinary perſwaſion of Gods ſpirit, ſhe did verily believe that God had determined that this people ſhould deſtroy the inhabitants of the land, and dwell in their room, therefore reſolved to do what ſhe could in preſerving theſe ſpies, though it were with the hazarding of her ſelf: and thus though it be groſſe treachery
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42229:8"/>
in it ſelf for man or woman to hide thoſe that ſeek the ruine of their countrey, and when they are ſought for, to make way for their eſcape; yet this in Rahab was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and that becauſe ſhe did it in faith, and to further that which ſhe knew God would have done, whoſe will is the ſure rule both of good and evil: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhe knew the Iſraelites would certainly take the city, though theſe ſpyes ſhould have been apprehended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There came men unto me, but I wiſt not whence they were,</hi> &amp;c.] In this anſwer of Rahab to the Kings meſſengers, firſt, ſhe plainly and readily, without any ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, confeſſeth what ſhe knew was certainly known, and could not therefore be denied, to wit, that there did two ſtrangers that evening come into her houſe, and that as hoping by her ingenuous confeſſion hereof, to make them the readier to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what ſhe meant further to ſay: But then in the next words ſhe doth directly deceive them with a feigned tale: For foure lies are manifeſt in the following words, firſt, That ſhe <hi>wiſt not whence they were:</hi> ſecondly, verſ. 5. That <hi>about the time of ſhutting of the gate the men went out,</hi> that is, out of the city: thirdly, That whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were gone ſhe wot not: and fourthly, That if they purſued after them quickly, they might overtake them. Nor need we wonder that Rahab ſhould be ſo highly commended for this ſhe did, ſeeing ſhe ſpake that in ſo many particulars which ſhe knew was not true; her ſeeking to hide the ſpies was an act of faith, very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, but her lying to the meſſengers was an infirmity, which God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to paſſe over: and thus indeed corruption doth uſually intermingle it ſelf in the beſt actions of the ſervants of God, and makes them do the good they do lamely and imperfectly.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Purſue after them quickly, for ye ſhall overtake them.]</hi> Thus by intimating the neceſſity of a ſpeedy purſuit, and by giving them hope of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them if they would immediately purſue them, ſhe made ſemblance as if ſhe deſired they might be apprehended, and withall, put them off from that exact ſearch, which otherwiſe they would ſurely have made.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>But ſhe had brought them up to the roof of the houſe, and hid them with the ſtalks of flax,</hi> &amp;c.] Their houſes being built plain on the top like the leads of our churches, there ſhe had ſpread the ſtalks of flax that they might be dried by the ſunne, and under thoſe ſhe hid them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And the men purſued after them the way to Jordan unto the foords.]</hi> That is, being fully poſſeſſed with an opinion, that they ſhould overtake and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend theſe ſpies of Iſrael, they never ſearched her houſe any further, but, as Rahab had adviſed them, away preſently they went out of the city in the purſuit of them; wherein the overuling power of God infatuating theſe men was clearly diſcovered, there being indeed no juſt reaſon why the words of an harlot, without any evidence given of the proof of what ſhe ſaid, ſhould ſo eaſily have beaten them off from the ſearch of her houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And as ſoon as they which purſued after them were gone out, they ſhut the gate.]</hi> That is, as ſoon as the Kings meſſengers were gone out of the citie to purſue after the ſpies, the men of the citie ſhut the gates, as thinking thereby to make ſure that if they were not yet gone out, as Rahab had ſaid they were, they ſhould not get out
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42229:9"/>
afterwards: and this is noted, firſt, to ſhew the perillous ſtraits the poore ſpies were ſtill left in, being thus ſhut up in an enemies city without any poſſible way, as it might ſeem, of eſcape: and ſecondly, to intimate how herein alſo God did infatuate the inhabitants of the city, who though they thought of preventing the eſcape of the ſpies if they were not already gone out, and were thereupon ſo cautelous to ſhut the gates ſo ſoon as ever the Kings meſſengers were gone forth, yet never minded the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſcouts and watchmen about the walls of the citie to prevent likewiſe their eſcaping that way. But thus God is wont to cauſe the wiſdome of the wiſe to periſh, as the prophet ſpeaks, Eſa. 29.14.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And before they were laid down, ſhe came up unto them upon the roof.]</hi> That is, before the men of the city were laid down, of whom mention was made in the foregoing verſe, ſhe ſtayed not till all were gone to reſt, but ſo ſoon as the gate was ſhut, ſhe went up unto the ſpies on the roof; or if we underſtand it of the ſpies to whom ſhe went up, the meaning muſt be this, that before they were returned from that place where they were hid, to their beds, there to lie down and take their reſt, <hi>ſhe came up to them upon the roof,</hi> &amp;c. ſhe did not ſuffer them to take their reſt there that night, becauſe the danger was over, and then ſend them away the next day, but preſently went up to them to ſatisfie them what was done (for lying in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they could not but long to know the event) and having then made a covenant with them, immediately let them down out at the window.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And ſhe ſaid unto the men, I know the Lord hath given you the land,</hi> &amp;c.] Doubtleſſe ſhe did firſt acquaint them with that which had paſſed betwixt the Kings meſſengers and her; but to avoid the repeating again of that which was before related, the ſtory here begins with the profeſſion ſhe makes to them of her confidence that the Iſraelites would certainly drive out her people and poſſeſſe their land, making this the ground of that ſhe had done even to the manifeſt hazarding of her own life for their preſervation, and of the requeſt ſhe afterwards makes to them, that they ſhould ſpare her and her fathers houſe, when they took Jericho. And indeed obſervable it is, that whereas the Iſraelites knew that this had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to their fathers for many generations, and had heard that promiſe often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them by Moſes, and had ſeen the great things which God had done for them, and yet notwithſtanding did ever and anon ſtagger and fear, this poor woman, which had onely heard of a report of the wonders which God had done for them, was confidently perſwaded that God would give them the land, and made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of it, <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>that the Lord hath given you the land;</hi> inſomuch that whilſt theſe ſpies were as yet in ſuch a deſperate danger in the eye of reaſon, being locked up in a citie of their enemies, and not knowing how to eſcape away, ſhe could beg of them for kindneſſe and mercy to be ſhown to her &amp; hers, no otherwiſe then if they had taken the citie already, and ſo all the lives of the inhabitants had been at their diſpoſing. As for their talking thus together being of two ſeverall nations, we need not queſtion that, for certainly the language of the Canaanites and other neighbouring nations was not in thoſe times much different from that of the Hebrew, as by many names both of men and cities amongſt the Canaanites is very evident.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Swear unto me by the Lord, ſince I have ſhewed you kindneſſe, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42229:9"/>
ye will alſo ſhew kindneſſe unto my fathers houſe.]</hi> The kindneſſe which Rahab here ſaith ſhe had ſhown to the ſpies, was not onely her hiding them from the Kings meſſengers, but alſo the project ſhe had deviſed and reſolved upon for the letting of them down out of her window (and indeed the other had been but a ſmall kindneſſe to them without this) and therefore queſtionleſſe ſhe had acquainted them with her reſolution herein, though that be not expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And give me a true token.]</hi> That is, a ſigne whereby we may make our ſelves known to the Iſraelites when they take the city, and wherein you will be true and faithfull to us, and when you ſee it, ſpare us from the generall deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the men anſwered her our life for yours.]</hi> This is ſpoken by way of oath and execration, which Rahab had deſired of them, verſ. 12. as if they had ſaid, May deſtruction light upon us, if we take not ſuch order that you and yours ſhall be preſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If ye utter not this our buſineſſe.]</hi> To bind her the more ſtrictly, ſay ſome Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours, to perſevere in this ſhe had begun to do, and not to diſcover them ſo ſoon as they were gone. They annex this condition, and thereby give her a hint, that if ſhe brought them in danger by diſcovering them, though God ſhould preſerve them by ſome other means, yet ſhe muſt expect no mercy from them. But I rather conceive that the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> they here ſpeak of, is chiefly that compact betwixt them agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the preſervation of her and hers, and the ſigne whereby they were to know her houſe, as ſeems probable verſ. 20. where the ſpies having ſpoken of this compact betwixt them, they then repeat theſe words, <hi>If thou utter this our buſineſſe, then we will be quit of this thine oath.</hi> The meaning whereof is, that if by uttering that agreement which they had made, others beſides her kindred ſhould crowd into her houſe, or by uſing the ſame token of hanging out a ſcarlet thread, think to preſerve their houſholds alſo from the publick deſtruction, they would not then be bound by their oath to afford her or hers any mercy.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And ſhe ſaid unto them, Get you to the mountains,</hi> &amp;c.] Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this conference betwixt them which here follows, was before ſhe let the ſpies out at her window: But the contrary is evident, verſ. 18. where they ſpeak of her letting them down out at the window as a thing already done, <hi>Thou ſhalt bind this line of ſcarlet thread in the window which thou didſt let us down by.</hi> Indeed it is probable that the ſpies had before they were let down agreed with her (though that be not expreſſed) that the line of ſcarlet thread, which ſhe had in a readineſſe to let them down by, ſhould hang out at her window, that thereby the Iſraelites might know her houſe when they came againſt the city. But this which is here rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was doubtleſſe ſpoken after the men were down, in the ſtill of the night, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man looking down to them out at her window.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the men ſaid, We will be blameleſſe of this thine oath,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, we would not be found faulty in not keeping the oath which thou haſt cauſed us to ſwear, nor would we be thought faulty therein when indeed we are not; this therefore they premiſe as the reaſon they deſired to have it cleared fully betwixt them upon what conditions they had ſwore to ſecure her and hers; and accordingly they propound three conditions in the following words: firſt, that the line of ſcarlet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42229:10"/>
thread, whereby they were let down, muſt be hanged out at the window, as the token whereby the houſe ſhould be known; and if therefore through neglecting to do this, the Iſraelites ſhould break into her houſe and offer them any violence, they would be guiltleſſe: ſecondly, that her father, mother, brethren, and kindred ſhould come home to her houſe and abide there; and therefore if any of them were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not being in the houſe, that ſhould be no breach of their oath: and thirdly, that ſhe ſhould by no means utter this which had paſſed betwixt them to any body whatever, and if therefore others ſhould delude them by hanging out a ſcarlet thread at their window alſo, they would not be bound by their oath to ſave neither the one nor the other.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Joſhua roſe early in the morning, and they removed from Shittim,</hi> &amp;c.] By the inference of this upon that which went before in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the foregoing chapter, concerning the return of the ſpies which he had ſent from Jericho, it may ſeem that having heard from them the report which they made of the fear of the inhabitants, he roſe early the very next morning and went away with all the Iſraelites from Shittim to Jordan; but if we thus underſtand this place, then it muſt neceſſarily be yielded, that before the ſpies returned to him, he had given that charge to the Iſraelites by the Officers, whereof mention was made before, chap. 1.11. to wit, that they ſhould prepare themſelves victualls, and that becauſe within three daies they ſhould paſſe over Jordan. For that charge was certainly given them at Shittim, (it could not be given them when they came to Jordan, where they lodged onely one night, as it is ſaid here, and then paſſed over the next day) and muſt needs therefore be given them before the ſpies came back, if Joſhua went away from Shittim the very next morning after their return. But now, becauſe it is very improbable that Joſhua would appoint the people to prepare to paſſe over Jordan within three dayes, when as yet he could not tell whether the ſpies would return within that time or no, neither was it to any purpoſe to ſend them if he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to wait for their return, that according to the information they ſhould give him they might order their journey, therefore I conceive rather, that the drift of theſe words is onely to ſhew, that when they removed from Shittim to Jordan, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua roſe early in the morning that day, to diſpoſe of all things for their intended journey, and not that it was early the next morning after the ſpies returned. And ſo in this order I conceive thoſe things were done which are here related: Firſt, after the return of the ſpies, the people being much encouraged by the tidings they brought, <hi>Joſhua commanded the Officers of the people</hi> (as is noted before, chap. 1.10, 11.) <hi>ſaying, Paſſe through the host and command the people, ſaying, Prepare you victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, for within three dayes ye ſhall paſſe over this Jordan:</hi> Secondly, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had according to this direction made proviſion for their journey, <hi>Joſhua roſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning, and they removed from Shittim and came to Jordan.</hi> And then thirdly, the three dayes being expired after which they had been told they ſhould paſſe over Jordan (and that was the very day it ſeems when they were come to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42229:10"/>
Jordan) Joſhua again ſent the officers through the hoſt to give direction to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how they ſhould follow the ark the next day in paſſing over the river Jordan; and this is that which follows in the next verſe, <hi>And it came to paſſe after three dayes that the officers went through the hoſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>When ye ſee the Ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the Priests the Levites bearing it,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note upon Numb. 4.15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Yet there ſhall be a ſpace between you and it, about two thouſand cubits by meaſure,</hi> &amp;c. As near as they could gueſſe by their eye: and two thouſand cubits was a thouſand yards of our meaſure. But why were the people enjoyned, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ark as it was carried by the Prieſts before them to lead them over Jordan, to keep ſo farre behind it? I anſwer, firſt, That all Expoſitours do joyntly agree, that this was partly to teach them to fear the Lord their God, of whoſe preſence amongſt them the ark was a ſigne. But ſecondly, another reaſon is here rendred in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>Come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not paſſed this way heretofore.</hi> The meaning whereof is ſomewhat queſtionable: for there are ſome that conceive of theſe words thus; to wit, That they were enjoyned to keep thus farre behind the ark, to the end they might all the more commodiouſly ſee the ark when the Prieſts went with it into the river Jordan, and how the waters of the river were divided before them, and ſo might <hi>know the way</hi> by which they were to go. But I ſee not how their being two thouſand cubits behind the ark, could be an advantage for the ſeeing of this, and not rather a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; unleſſe we ſuppoſe that being ſo farre behind the ark, they were upon the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of a hill, which led down to the river Jordan, from whence they might behold how the Prieſts went on with the ark, and entred the river. Better therefore, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, theſe words may be underſtood thus, <hi>Come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye muſt go:</hi> That is, that the Prieſts bearing the ark may diſcover a ſure and ſafe paſſage for you through the river, before you come near to enter into it. Indeed when the river was divided before them, there could be no queſtion of ſeeing the way they were to go. But as yet God did not make known to them the miracle he meant to work, but held them as it were in ſuſpence, onely intimating the danger of this paſſage, by commanding this diſtance betwixt the ark and them, to the end the Lord by the ark which went before them, might find out a ſafe way for them, before they might offer to ſet a foot in the channel. And thus this forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehenſion of the danger of the paſſage, might make them with the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and thankfulneſſe acknowledge the mercie of the following miracle.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And Joſhua ſaid unto the people, Sanctifie your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by endeavouring to bring your hearts to a holy temper, vvith all faith and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and admiration to obſerve the great works which God will do for you: and happely alſo by thoſe Legal rites of waſhing their clothes, and keeping themſelves apart from their wives, formerly likewiſe enjoyned at the giving the Law. See Exod. 19. ver. 10. and 15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>This day will I begin to magnifie thee in the ſight of all Iſrael.]</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was Joſhua a type of Chriſt whom God magnified at his firſt entrance upon the publick diſcharge of his Office, to wit, at his baptiſme, Mat. 3.16, 17. <hi>And Jeſus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42229:11"/>
when he was baptiſed, went straightway out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the spirit of God deſcending like a dove, and lighting upon him. And lo a voice from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved ſonne, in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> as he did alſo afterwards by his many miracles, for he was <hi>a man approved of God amongſt them, by miracles, and ſignes, and wonders, which God did by him in the midst of them,</hi> Acts 2.22.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>When you are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye ſhall ſtand ſtill in Jordan.]</hi> This is meant onely of a little ſtop the prieſts were to make upon their firſt ſetting their feet into the waters of Jordan (which had at that time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the banks, verſ. 15.) namely till thereupon the Lord had miraculouſly divided the waters, and opened a fair paſſage for them and the people to go through. For that being done, the prieſts went immediately forward with the ark upon their ſhoulders into the midſt of Jordan. And then indeed they ſtood ſtill there till all the people were gone over, as it is afterwards expreſſed, verſ. 17. <hi>And the prieſts that bare the ark of the Covenant of the Lord, stood firm on dry ground in the midſt of Jordan; and all the Iſraelites paſſed over on dry ground, untill the people were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed clean over Jordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and Hittites,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note upon Deut. 7.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Now therefore take ye twelve men out of the tribes of Iſrael, out of every tribe a man.]</hi> Here it is not expreſſed for what imployment theſe twelve men were to be choſen; but Chap. 4.2. we are told for what ſervice it was, namely, to take twelve ſtones out of the midſt of the river, and to ſet them up in Gilgal as a memoriall of this miraculous paſſage. For that they are the ſame here ſpoken of ſeems implyed, chap. 4.4. where it is ſaid, at the ſecond repeating this charge, <hi>that Joſhua called the twelve men whom he had prepared,</hi> to wit, before they paſſed over Jordan. Yet the giving the charge here may alſo happely implie, that the ſame twelve men were alſo to go along with the Prieſts that they might be the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eye-witneſſes of this miraculous work of Jordans dividing.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Aſſoon as the ſoles of the feet of the Priests that bare the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] Here Joſhua makes known to the people the miracle that God intended to work to give them entrance into the land of Canaan, namely, that the Lord would divide the waters of Jordan before them, that ſo they might paſſe over on drie land. And obſervable it is, that in relating this to them, firſt, he particularly informs them that this ſhould be done at the very firſt ſetting of the Prieſts feet that bare the ark in the waters of Jordan, thereby to aſſure them both that it was the Lord their God, of whoſe preſence the ark was a ſigne, by whoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power the waters ſhould be divided; and likewiſe that the Lord did this for them becauſe of the Covenant which he had made with them, whence that is ſo often repeated, verſ. 11. and again, verſ. 14. that it was <hi>the ark of the Covenant</hi> that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over before them. And ſecondly, that they might not queſtion the Lords doing of this he puts them in mind of the Lords ſovereigne power in ruling and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole world under this Title, <hi>the Lord of all the earth: Aſſoon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as the ſoles of the feet of the Priests that bare the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42229:11"/>
earth, ſhall reſt in the waters of Jordan, the waters of Jordan ſhall be cut off,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>For Jordan overfloweth all his banks at the time of harveſt.]</hi> To wit, of barly-harveſt, which was in that hot countrey in their firſt moneth, called Abib or Niſan, the moneth wherein the Paſſeover was kept (as is evident Levit. 23.10. where it is ſaid, that at the feaſt they were to bring a ſheaf of the firſt-fruits of their harveſt unto the Prieſt) and therefore we find it elſewhere ſo expreſſed, 1. Chron. 12.15. <hi>Theſe are they that went over Jordan in the firſt moneth when it had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown all his banks.</hi> And indeed obſervable it is, that the Lord brought his people into the land of Canaan in harveſt time, juſt when it was ready furniſhed with the fruits of the earth that were to be for their proviſion and ſtore the following yeare. As for Jordans overflowing his banks at this time, either it was the nature of this river ſo to do: or elſe it was, as ſome conceive, becauſe the ſunne growing hot at this time of the yeare great ſtreams of water came running down from the mountains about Jordan, by reaſon of the melting of the ſnow that lay there, and ſo cauſed the river to overflow his banks. But however, the reaſons why this clauſe is here inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted we may conceive to be theſe: Firſt, to ſhew how God did herein trie the faith of the Iſraelites, ſeeming herein as it were to oppoſe their entrance into the land. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to ſhew the neceſſitie of the miraculous dividing of the waters of Jordan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by reaſon of this inundation of the waters they could not paſſe over the foords as at other times. Thirdly, to ſhew how the feet of the Prieſts could touch the brim of the waters as is ſaid in the foregoing words before they came at the chanell, in a place convenient for them to ſtand on awhile; it was becauſe Jordan at that time overflowed his banks.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>The waters which came down from above ſtood and roſe up upon an heap,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of the firſt clauſe of this verſe concerning the waters above the place where Jordan was divided is not much queſtioned by expoſitours, all in a manner making this to be the meaning of them, that thoſe upper waters ſtood firm as a wall, ſwelling continually and riſing up higher and higher even as farre back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as from <hi>the citie Adam that is beſides Zaretan,</hi> unto the place where the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites paſſed over: and that by reaſon of the ſucceſſive coming down of the waters from above, and their ſtay in that place, where they were bounded and barred up by the Almighty power of God. But now the ſecond clauſe, which ſpeaks of waters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the place where the river was divided, <hi>and thoſe that came down towards the ſea of the plain, even the ſalt ſea, failed and were cut off,</hi> is ſomewhat more queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; and that becauſe ſome by the failing and cutting off thoſe lower waters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand onely this, that they rolled a little way toward the ſalt ſea, till there was a ſpace broad enough for the people to go over, and then not being ſupplied ſtill as before by the waters from above, failed and were cut off from the upper waters, and there ſtood on a heap, verſ. 13. and ſo the ground lay bare for the Iſraelites to paſſe over. But then others again, by the failing and cutting off thoſe waters underſtand that thoſe lower waters, after they were divided from thoſe that were above, paſſing away by degrees toward the dead ſea, they failed and were cut off for want of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie from above, and ſo the whole channell down toward the ſea was left quite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water. And this I conceive is moſt agreeable to the words of the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42229:12"/>Verſ. 17. <hi>And all the Iſraelites paſſed over on drie ground, untill all the people were paſſed clean over Jordan.]</hi> That is, the waters of Jordan being thus divided, the whole people of Iſrael went quietly over, there being no body on the other ſide to withſtand them; which is indeed very obſervable. It hath alwayes been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant policie of all nations to guard the rivers through which the enemie muſt paſſe into their countreys, becauſe there they have a great advantage over them to hinder their entrance into their land: and how was it then that the Canaanites had not then ſet a guard upon theſe foords of Jordan? I anſwer, Sure, becauſe they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently perſwaded that the Iſraelites could not have paſſed over by reaſon of the overflowing of Jordan at that time; or elſe, becauſe God had ſtricken them with ſuch a fear and trembling of heart that they durſt not ſtirre out of their walled ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or elſe, becauſe he had infatuated them and deprived them of that wiſdome which is ordinarily found in other men for the defence of their countrey againſt an enemie.</p>

And indeed therefore was it there onely briefly touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to be here again more largely expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the Prieſts feet ſtood firm, twelve ſtones,</hi> &amp;c.] In the ſeventh verſe the reaſon is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed why theſe twelve ſtones were to be taken up out of Jordan, about the place where the Prieſts had ſtood with the ark, and to be carried to the place where they were to lodge that night, which was Gilgal, verſ. 19. namely that they might there ſtand as a memoriall to ſucceeding generations of this miraculous work, when the Lord was pleaſed to divide Jordan before the ark that the twelve tribes might paſſe over to take poſſeſſion of the land which he had given them for an inheritance: But may ſome ſay, ſeeing the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and one half of the tribe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh, had already their inheritance aſſigned them without Jordan, yea and were already in poſſeſſion of it, why were theſe tribes with the reſt to teſtifie their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe by ſetting up this memoriall of Gods miraculous dividing of Jordan before them? Now for the anſwer of this, it is not enough to ſay, that about fourtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of theſe tribes went over Jordan at this time with the reſt of their brethren to aſſiſt them in their warres, and that becauſe theſe ſtones were ſet up in the name of the whole tribes, and therefore the queſtion ſtill remains why theſe tribes were to come in for a ſhare in erecting this monument of Gods praiſe, that had for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular no ſhare in the mercie? The truer anſwer therefore I conceive to be this, That theſe tribes were to joyn with the reſt herein, firſt, Becauſe the whole people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael though conſiſting of twelve ſeverall tribes were yet all one body, and therefore no good could be done to any of the tribes, but the whole body muſt needs have an intereſt in it, and ought to be thankfull for it: and ſecondly, Becauſe hereby they might ſhew that the land which was allotted them without Jordan was a part
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42229:12"/>
of that land of promiſe, the poſſeſſion whereof was thankfully acknowledged in thoſe twelve ſtones which were now ſet up in Gilgal.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>For the Priests that bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan untill every thing was finiſhed that the Lord commanded Joſhua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moſes commanded Joſhua.]</hi> This clauſe, <hi>according to all that Moſes commanded Joſhua,</hi> cannot be ſo underſtood, as if Moſes had particularly commanded Joſhua that which was now done by the Prieſts and people in their paſſage over Jordan. For Moſes had never ſpoken of any ſuch thing to Joſhua, but Joſhua had received theſe directions immediately from God. But the meaning of theſe words is onely this, that all was done as God commanded Joſhua, which was according to what Moſes had given Joſhua in charge: Moſes had commanded Joſhua to ſee that all things were done according to the word of the Lord, and ſo it was in this particular of their paſſage over Jordan, according to the charge he had received from Moſes, all things were done as the Lord commanded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the people haſted and paſſed over.]</hi> This haſte which they made in paſſing over was not ſo much becauſe a multitude of people were to paſſe over in a few houres, and were afterwards to go as farre as Gilgal that day, as from their fear and weakneſſe of faith; the ſight of that mountain of waters which ſeemed ready to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm them could not but ſcare them, and hence it was that every man made all the ſpeed he could out of that vale of the ſhadow of death. Now this is the rather added in this place, the more hereby to extoll the faith of the prieſts, who ſtood ſtill without moving in the midſt of Jordan till the whole camp of Iſrael were gotten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into the land of Canaan, and all other things were done concerning the ſtones ſet up in Gilgal, and in the midſt of Jordan, as God had appointed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>About fourty thouſand prepared for warre paſſed over,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, of Ruben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manaſſeh, the reſt being left in garriſon for the defence of the land, their wives, children, and cattell: for at the laſt numbring of the people, there was of the Reubenites fourty three thouſand ſeven hundred and thirty, and of the Gadites fourty thouſand five hundred, Numb. 26.7, 18. beſides the half of Manaſſehs tribe, who were in all fifty two thouſand ſeven hundred, Numb. 26.34.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the firſt moneth.]</hi> Which was the very day whereon, by the Law, the lambe for the Paſſeover was to be ſet apart, Exod. 12.3. And hereby it is clear, that it was full fourty years within foure or five dayes, from the coming of the Iſraelites out of Egypt, to their entrance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42229:13"/>
into the land of promiſe; for they came out of Egypt on the fifteenth day of the firſt moneth, and now on the tenth day of the firſt moneth they entred the land of Canaan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you untill ye were paſſed over,</hi> &amp;c.] The Iſraelites are appointed thus to anſwer their children for many generations after, when they ſhould inquire concerning thoſe ſtones that were ſet up in Gilgal, even as if that miracle had been wrought for them in their own perſons, <hi>the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you,</hi> &amp;c. and that becauſe in that the Lord did this for their Anceſtours, he did it for them, who were then in the loyns of their Anceſtours, and that in regard of the profeſſion of the ſame faith, they might look upon that which was done for their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, as a pledge of his fatherly love to them alſo, and his care of their welfare.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>AT that time the Lord ſaid unto Joſhua, Make thee ſharp knives and circumciſe again the children of Iſrael the ſecond time.]</hi> In this charge which the Lord gave to Joſhua for the circumciſing of the children of Iſrael, to wit, thoſe that were born in their travels through the wilderneſſe who had not been hitherto circumciſed, there are many things queſtionable; as firſt, the time when this charge was given to Joſhua, it is ſaid here, that <hi>at that time the Lord ſaid unto Joſhua, Make thee ſharp knives</hi> &amp;c. which hath manifeſt relation to that which went before; but may be meant, either, that God gave them that charge on the tenth day of the firſt moneth mentioned in the former chapter, verſ. 19. preſently after they were paſſed over Jordan, (and indeed later then ſo this charge could not be given; for they were doubtleſſe circumciſed on the eleventh day, the very next day after their paſſing over Jordan, or elſe the anguiſh of their cutting, which uſed to be greateſt on the third day after circumciſion, Gen. 34.25. could not be, in any good meaſure, over on the fourteenth day at even, when they were to celebrate the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over) or elſe in a larger extent, namely, that <hi>at that time</hi> when God gave them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for their paſſing over Jordan, and thoſe other things formerly related, he gave them alſo this charge, that when they were paſſed over Jordan they ſhould cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe thoſe of the people that were as yet uncircumciſed; and this may be thought the more probable; firſt, becauſe then they might have the more time to provide the ſharp knives here mentioned: and ſecondly, becauſe then they might take order for the circumciſing thoſe of the two tribes and a half, whom they had left behind them on the other ſide Jordan, as likewiſe for their celebrating the Paſſeover, who in all probability were not left uncircumciſed, when the reſt of their brethren were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. Secondly, what theſe knives were which Joſhua was appointed to prepare for this ſervice. The word in the Originall is tranſlated by ſome, <hi>knives of edges, or ſharp knives,</hi> and by others, <hi>knives of flints</hi> (for the word will bear both tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) and accordingly, ſome concieve that Joſhua was here enjoyned to make ſo many ſharp flints, or knives of flints, as were requiſite for this ſervice: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this tended the better to ſhadow forth our circumciſion by Chriſt, who is our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42229:13"/>
rock: and others again conceive that he was onely to provide knives or raſours well ſharpned wherewith to circumciſe them; &amp; indeed 1. becauſe in the firſt inſtitution of circumciſion we find no ſuch thing preſcribed, as that it ſhould be done with ſtones: and 2. becauſe it cannot be well conceived how knives of flints, for the ſpeedy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing of ſo many hundred thouſand men could be on ſuch a ſudden purpoſely made, therefore I conceive that the ſharpning, or at leaſt the getting in a readineſſe ſo many knives exactly ſharpned, is all that was here enjoyned Joſhua: Thirdly, why the Lord commanded this to be done immediately upon their entrance into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan: of which theſe reaſons may be given, to wit, 1. becauſe being come to Gilgal, where the camp continued many years, and ſo not being to remove from one place to another as they had done formerly at the removall of the cloud, they had not that reaſon to forbear circumciſion now, which they had before. 2. that this might ſignifie to them that it was by virtue of that covenant which God had made with their fathers, whereof circumciſion was the outward ſeal, that they were now put into poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan, and might the more courageouſly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the inhabitants, having received this badge of their adoption, the ſigne of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: 3. that God might hereby make triall of their faith: and indeed a very hard triall it was if it be well conſidered. All that were the flower and ſtrength of their armies were now to be circumciſed, to wit, all that were born ſince their coming out of Egypt, and that was all under fourty years of age: and when they lay ſore of their circumciſion, how eaſie a matter it had been for their enemies, after the routing of thoſe of the more aged that were not now circumciſed, to have come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reſt, and to have cut all their throats, we may ſee by the ſlaughter which the two ſonnes of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, made amongſt the Shechemites when they lay in the ſame condition, Gen. 34.25, 26. So that nothing could be more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then that which God now enjoyned them. Had this been done when they were on the other ſide Jordan where the inhabitants were already deſtroyed, it might have been done farre more ſafely and ſecurely: but now when they were hemmed in by the river Jordan in the land of their enemies, to weaken themſelves ſo farre, that if they ſhould come ſuddenly upon them, as they had reaſon to expect, they could be no way able to make any reſiſtance; this was all one, in the ſight of reaſon, as if they had been commanded to bind one another hand and foot, that the people of the land might come upon them and maſſacre them all. And thus I ſay the Lord made triall of their faith, to wit, whether in confidence of his protection they would do whatever he enjoyned them, though it ſeemed never ſo perillous in the judgement of their own reaſon. 4, becauſe on the fourteenth day of this moneth at even they were to eat the Paſſeover, of which none might eat that were uncircumciſed, Exod. 12.48. <hi>No uncircumciſed perſon ſhall eat thereof.</hi> Yea, when they were once in poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan, they were to obſerve all the precepts of the ceremoniall Law exactly, Deut. 12.8, 9, 10. and circumciſion was the ſeal of the covenant whereby they were bound to the keeping of theſe Laws, whence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, Gal. 5.3. that <hi>every man that is circumciſed, is a debter to the whole Law.</hi> But laſt of all, it may be queſtioned, why the circumciſing of the Iſraelites given now in charge to Joſhua, is called circumciſing them <hi>again the ſecond time?</hi> And to this I anſwer,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42229:14"/>
that the reaſon of this is, not becauſe thoſe that had been circumciſed before were to be now circumciſed again, (for that could not be) but becauſe this ordinance of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which had been for ſome years omitted, was now to be put in practiſe again; <hi>Circumciſe again the children of Iſrael the ſecond time:</hi> That is, ſet on foot again the uſe of the Sacrament, which had now been forborn and intermitted theſe fourty years. The firſt time of circumciſing was from the time that it was firſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Abraham unto their coming out of Egypt; ſince then they had not uſed it; and thence is it, that Joſhua is commanded to begin again that holy rite <hi>the ſecond time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Joſhua made him ſharp knives, and circumciſed the children of Iſrael at the hill of the foreskins.]</hi> That is, according as God had commanded, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua took order for the providing of ſharp knives, and for the circumciſing thoſe of the Iſraelites that were as yet uncircumciſed, and that was all that were under fourty years old, all that were born ſince their coming out of Egypt. And indeed, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how many thouſand there were of theſe, and how ſpeedily this work was to be done, (for it was begun on the eleventh day of the moneth, and was to be ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatched that they might be able to eat the Paſſeover on the fourteenth day of the moneth at even) it was not poſſible that this could be done by Joſhua himſelf, but we may rather well think, that all that were before circumciſed were imployed in this ſervice. As for the place where this was done, it was called upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Gibeah-haazaloth,</hi> that is, <hi>the hill of foreskins,</hi> to wit, becauſe there they did caſt away or bury the foreskins of thoſe that were circumciſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of warre died in the wilderneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, all the people that were twenty years old and upward, Numb. 14.29. <hi>Your carcaſes ſhall fall in the wilderneſſe, and all that were numbred of you according to your whole number from twenty years old, and upward, which have murmured against me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>But all the people that were born in the wilderneſſe by the way, as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumciſed.]</hi> To wit, becauſe they were upon the way travelling towards the land of Canaan (as the words here ſeem to imply) and ſo could not conveniently circumciſe their children. For after they were newly circumciſed, reſt was requiſite, and it muſt needs be very dangerous to remove them, whilſt they yet lay ſore of their circumciſion; though they ſtayed long in ſome places, yet they knew not beforehand of their ſtay, but were continually in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to remove upon the removing of the cloud that went before them. Had the Iſraelites ſinned in this, it is not likely that either God, who ſeverely puniſhed them for other breaches of his Law would have paſſed by this ſo many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unpuniſhed, yea unreproved; or that Moſes, who ſmarted for the neglect of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in his own familie, Exod. 4.24. would have ſuffered the people to runne on without check in ſo groſſe a contempt of Gods ordinance. And therefore, either God gave them a ſpeciall diſpenſation for this time of their travell, or elſe they knew that the rite of being circumciſed the eighth day, was not ſo enjoyned that upon no occaſion it might be differred (for what if at that time the child were ſick and weak?) &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having ſo juſt a cauſe they did now intermit this duty of circumciſion till they could come into the promiſed land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42229:14"/>Verſ. 7. <hi>And their children, whom he raiſed up in their ſtead, them Joſhua cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.]</hi> That is, thoſe that were born in their travels: For thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der twenty years at their coming out of Egypt being now living, were already cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; ſo that Joſhua brought into the land of Canaan, Iſraelites both circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and uncircumciſed, being herein a type of Chriſt, <hi>who hath made both one,</hi> Eph. 2.14. In whom there is no difference between Jew and Gentile, circumciſion and uncircumciſion, Col. 3.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>They abode in their places in the camp till they were whole.]</hi> To wit, no enemy attempting any thing againſt them, or once offering to moleſt them in this their weakneſſe, no not ſo much as to ſcare them or put them in any fright. To try their faith and obedience, God enjoyns not circumciſion on the other ſide of Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, where they might have done it more ſafely and ſecurely, without fear of their enemies taking advantage againſt them; but here in the very face of their enemies: now they found that there was no danger in truſting God, and doing what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Joſhua, This day have I rolled away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of Egypt from off you.]</hi> In this word <hi>rolled,</hi> the Lord ſeems to allude to the manner of circumciſion, to wit, becauſe when they were circumciſed, their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skinnes being ſlit up, were rolled upward, and then cut off and caſt away. But the greateſt difficulty in theſe words, is to know, why it is ſaid, that in their circumciſion the reproch of Egypt was rolled away from off them; and of this there are two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given, both which are very probable: For firſt, ſome by <hi>the reproch of Egypt</hi> underſtand the reproches which the Egyptians did uſually caſt upon the Iſraelites, that they were fugitives and rebels, and had under a pretence of being Gods people, caſt off the yoke of their lawfull Sovereigne; and theſe reproches of the Egyptians, they ſay, were now confuted by the circumciſion of the Iſraelites, becauſe it was the ſeal and mark of the choice that God had made of them to be his peculiar people, and that before they went down into Egypt out of Canaan, the land of promiſe, to which now they were returned. Had they continued ſtill in their uncircumciſion, wanting this badge of the ſpeciall intereſt which God had in them, they might have ſeemed lyable to thoſe reproches which the Egyptians caſt upon them; but now by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſeal of the ancient covenant which God had made with them, it was again made manifeſt that they had not revolted from their lawfull governours, but had onely embraced that libertie to which the Lord had reſtored them, who had long ſince taken them to be his peculiar people. But then ſecondly, others again by <hi>the reproch of Egypt,</hi> underſtand the uncircumciſion of their fleſh, and that becauſe as circumciſion was the glory of the Iſraelites, as being the outward badge of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt God and them, to wit, that he would be their God, and they ſhould be his peculiar people; whence it is that Saint Paul reckons this amongſt thoſe things whereof he might glory in regard of the fleſh, that he was <hi>circumciſed the eighth day,</hi> Phil. 3.4 5. ſo uncircumciſion was the reproch of other nations, in that it was the ſigne of their being <hi>aliens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, and strangers from the Covenant of promiſe,</hi> Eph. 2.11, 12. And thence we ſee with what contempt the Iſraelites were wont to ſpeak of other nations in regard of their uncircumciſion;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42229:15"/>
                     <hi>Who is this uncircumciſed Philistim,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>that he ſhould defie the armies of the living God?</hi> 1. Sam. 17.26. <hi>We dare not do this thing,</hi> ſay the ſonnes of Jacob to Hamor and Shechem, <hi>to give our ſister to one that is uncircumciſed; for that were a reproch unto us.</hi> Now, ſay they, however uncircumciſion was the common reproch of all nations, yet it is here called particularly <hi>the reproch of Egypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Iſraelites lived amongſt them, and were beſt acquainted with this reproch amongſt them. Jn regard that they came out of Egypt, and were no doubt attired like the Egyptians, had they continued in their uncircumciſion, they would have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed to be uncircumciſed Egyptians, then the Iſrael of God; but now being circumciſed, this reproch of Egypt was rolled away from off them. And this I take to be the beſt expoſition of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the children of Iſrael encamped in Gilgal, and kept the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> &amp;c.] Both thoſe that were of old circumciſed, and thoſe newly circumciſed; for by the fourteenth day at even they might be well recovered of their cutting. It ſeems the Paſſeover alſo had been unto this time not celebrated, at leaſt not by them that were uncircumciſed. See Exod. 12.48.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Paſſeover, unleavened cakes and parched corn in the ſelf ſame day.]</hi> By <hi>parched corn</hi> here, muſt needs be meant the new corn of the preſent yeare, and that becauſe, firſt, It is not probable that they uſed to parch any other but new corn, whileſt it was yet ſoft: and ſecondly, Becauſe elſe there ſhould be nothing that was ſingular concerning this day noted in theſe words. For doubtles they did eat unleavened bread the day before this, together with the Paſſeover; they are the expreſſe words of the law of the Paſſeover, Exod. 12.8. <hi>They ſhall eat the fleſh in that night, roſt with fire, and unleavened bread;</hi> and therefore that which is here noted concerning this <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after the Paſſeover,</hi> is, that then they did eat both unleavened cakes of the old corn of the land (which they might get out of the barns and granaries of the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about them, the inhabitants being fled into the defenced cities, or further up into the countrey) and likewiſe of the new corn of that yeare parched, <hi>the ſelf ſame day:</hi> for it was now juſt harveſt time, as was noted before, Chap. 3.15. when they entred Canaan. That which is moſt queſtionable in theſe words, is, what day it was that is called here, <hi>the morrow after the Paſſeover?</hi> Some hold that it was on the fifteenth day of the moneth, and that becauſe the Paſſeover was killed on the fourteenth day at even, Exod. 12.16. But becauſe it is evident that by the Law of God they might not eat of the new corn of the land, till they had brought a ſheaf of the firſt-fruits of their harveſt unto the Prieſts, Levit. 23.14, <hi>Ye ſhall eat neither bread, nor parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corn, nor green ears untill the ſelf ſame day that ye have brought an offering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your God;</hi> and that they did on the ſixteenth day of that moneth, <hi>the morrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſabbath,</hi> as it is there called, verſ. 11. that is, the morrow after the feaſt of unleavened bread, which was on the fifteenth day; therefore I ſhould think it farre more probable which others hold, to wit, that the ſixteenth day was <hi>the morrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Paſſeover</hi> here ſpoken of, whereon the Iſraelites did eat both unleavened cakes of the old corn, and parched corn of the new, even the very ſame day whereon the ſheaf of the firſt-fruits of their harveſt was offered to the Lord; after the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42229:15"/>
whereof they might lawfully eat of the new corn, and not till then. Nor need it ſeem ſtrange that the ſixteenth day ſhould be called <hi>the morrow after the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> here ſpoken of, becauſe though they killed the Paſſeover on the fourteenth day at even, yet the evening or night wherein they did eat the Paſchall Lambe, was the beginning of the fifteenth day, which might well therefore be called the day of the Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the manna ceaſed on the morrow after they had eaten the old corn of the land,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Expoſitours are of opinion that this alſo is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the ſixteenth day of the moneth, the ſame that is called in the foregoing verſe, <hi>the morrow after the Paſſeover:</hi> and that becauſe it cannot be denied but that the Iſraelites did eat unleavened cakes <hi>of the old corn of the land</hi> on the fifteenth day, which was the firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened bread. But ſince the text ſeems to make a manifeſt difference betwixt <hi>the morrow after the Paſſeover,</hi> verſ. 11. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they did eat unleavened cakes and parched corn; and <hi>the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land,</hi> in this verſe, when the manna ceaſed; therefore I think it more probable that the manna ceaſed on the ſeventeenth day of the moneth, and that is called <hi>the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land,</hi> with reference to that which went before, verſ. 11. to wit, the morrow after they had eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en (as was there ſaid) unleavened cakes of the old corn of the land, and parched corn in the ſelf ſame day. The reaſon why this is ſo expreſſely noted, that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ceaſed after the Iſraelites had begun to eat of the corn of the land, is becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was made evident, that the manna came not all this while they had enjoyed it from any naturall cauſe in the clouds; but was provided for them by an extraordinary way, during the time they wanted bread, by the Almighty power of God; who therefore now ſent it no longer, when they were entred into a land flowing with milk and hony, where they had plenty not of corn onely, but of all other proviſion likewiſe that was requiſite for them. And thus ſhall it be alſo with Gods people in heaven: As when the Iſraelites came to eat of the fruit of Canaan, manna ceaſed, ſo when we come to our heavenly Canaan, the word, the ſacraments, and all other outward comforts ſhall ceaſe, and that becauſe our bliſſe, our life, and our fruition of God there, ſhall need none of theſe outward ſupports, Rev. 21.22, 23. <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lambe are the Temple of it: And the citie had no need of the ſunne, neither of the moon to ſhine in it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And it came to paſſe when Joſhua was by Jericho, that he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold there ſtood a man,</hi> &amp;c.] It is evident, that long after this the camp of the Iſraelites continued ſtill in Gilgal: for it is ſaid of the Gibeonites, chap. 9.6. that <hi>they went to Joſhua unto the camp at Gilgal.</hi> But why then is it ſaid here, that Joſhua was by Jericho? I anſwer, firſt, That Gilgal, at leaſt the outmoſt quarters of the camp in Gilgal were not farre from Jericho, and therefore we ſee it is ſaid before, chap. 4.19. that <hi>they encamped at Gilgal in the eaſt border of Jericho:</hi> and ſecondly, That though the camp was in Gilgal, yet Joſhua might be come up nearer to Jericho upon ſome occaſion, as happely to obſerve the countrey about it, to ſee where it might be beſt aſſailed, and ſo might ſee the viſion here related, to wit, that <hi>he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold there ſtood a man over againſt him,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42229:16"/>
with his ſword drawn in his hand.</hi> Being, it ſeems, alone by himſelf either to pray or meditate, or perhaps to view the ſtrength of Jericho, on a ſudden, not thinking of any ſuch thing, as he looked up he ſaw a man ſtand before him with a drawn ſword in his hand, and this was the ſonne of God, the Angel of the Covenant, who now appeared thus to Joſhua in the ſhape of a man, to encourage him with aſſurance that God would fight for him againſt the inhabitants of the land, and particularly to give him directions what courſe he ſhould take againſt Jericho, as we may ſee in the following chapter, verſ. 2. where of this man thus appearing to Joſhua it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord,</hi> or Jehovah, <hi>ſaid unto Joſhua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And ye ſhall compaſſe the citie all the men of warre and go round about the citie once,</hi> &amp;c.] This no doubt they were enjoyned to do at ſuch a diſtance from the walls, that they might not be in danger of any arrows or other things which the inhabitants might ſhoot at them. That which is moſt worthy our enquiring in this courſe which the Lord here preſcribes for the taking of Jericho, is, why the Lord would have ſuch means uſed for the effecting of this, as were not onely ſo unlikely to effect it, but alſo ſo abſurd and ridiculous in the eye of reaſon; what likelihood was there in humane judgement, that their tracing about the city once every day for ſix dayes together, and ſeven times the ſeventh day, or that the Prieſts blowing with trumpets of rams-horns, and the ſhouting of the people, ſhould batter down the walls of ſo ſtrong a city? yea, the appointing of trumpets of rams-horns for the Prieſts, had above all the reſt a ſhew of ridiculouſneſſe. Had they made uſe of the ſilver trumpets of the Sanctuary, there had been both more ſtate, and a better ground of hope in the ſounding of thoſe ſacred ſignes of Gods preſence amongſt them; but theſe trumpets of rams-horns might ſeem onely fit to move laughter for a work of ſuch importance as they had now in hand. But to all this now it may be anſwered; Firſt, that hereby the Lord made it manifeſt beyond all exception, that it was he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that delivered the city into their hands: The leſſe they did herein, the leſſe cauſe had they to aſcribe any thing to their own wiſdome or valour; and the more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous the means were that were uſed, the more evident it was that the work was not done by any power of the means, but by the ſole power of God. Secondly, that hereby the almighty power of God was the more magnified, who could effect ſuch great works by ſuch unlikely and ſimple means; for this did diſcover plainly, how farre the power of God did ſurpaſſe the reach of mans wiſdome, even that (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1. Cor. 5.25) <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then men, and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42229:16"/>
weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then men.</hi> And thirdly, that the more abſurd and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the means appointed were in reaſon, the better was the faith of Gods people try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether they would in confidence of Gods promiſe do what he enjoyned them, however ſtrange it might ſeem to them, and would become fools, that they might be wiſe, as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1. Cor. 3.18. So that we ſee the Lord did in great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome preſcribe this courſe for the taking of Jericho, which reaſon was like to ſcorn and deride: yea, and herein we have beſides an obſervable figure of Gods ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world to Chriſt our Joſhua, or Jeſus, in theſe dayes of the Goſpel. For as by trumpets of rams-horns, that is, by <hi>the fooliſhneſſe of preaching</hi> (for ſo carnall men judge of it, 1. Cor. 1.21.) doth the Lord beat down all the <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi> and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Satan raiſed in mens hearts, <hi>even every high thing that exalts it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the knowledge of God, bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ,</hi> 2. Cor. 10.4, 5. That which the world counts fooliſhneſſe, 1. Cor. 1.23. <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſſe,</hi> it proves the mighty power of God unto ſalvation to thoſe that believe: and thus hath God provided, that all the glory ſhould redound to him, and not unto his inſtruments the preachers of the Goſpel: <hi>We have this treaſure in earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us,</hi> 2. Cor. 4.7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus ſhalt thou do ſix dayes,</hi> &amp;c.] Six dayes together, once a day, are the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites here appointed to march about Jericho in a ſolemn manner, as is afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and on the ſeventh day, verſ. 4. they were to do it ſeven ſeverall times; this doubtleſſe was to exerciſe the faith and patience of the people. It had been as eaſie for God to have cauſed the walls of Jericho to fall at the firſt dayes compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the citie, as after ſeven dayes toyl; but thus God loves to try the faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his people, to ſee whether they will wait for the accompliſhment of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, when they are not preſently fulfilled. As for their marching about the citie on the ſabbath day (which muſt needs be granted, becauſe they did it ſeven dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) we need not ſtumble at it: for Gods precept is the rule of righteouſneſſe, nor can men ſinne in doing what God hath commanded.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe that when they make a long blaſt,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note upon Exod. 19.19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the wall of the citie ſhall fall down flat,</hi> &amp;c.] But how was it then that Rahabs houſe did not fall together with the wall? for it is expreſſely ſaid before, Chap. 2.15. that her houſe was upon the wall, and ſhe dwelt upon the wall, and yet after the wall was fallen it is ſaid, verſ. 22. of this chapter, that Joſhua command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the two men that he had formerly ſent to ſpie out the countrey, to go into the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots houſe, and to bring her out, and all that ſhe had. Now to this I anſwer, that doubtleſſe therefore all the wall about the city did not fall, but onely that part of the wall over againſt which the Iſraelites were in a long train, when they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the city the laſt time, that ſo they might go up, every man right from the place where they were, and enter at this breach into the citie. And indeed, this makes the fall of the citie wall the more ſtrange and miraculous.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And the armed men went before the prieſts that blew the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark.]</hi> I doubt not but this order preſcribed here by Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42229:17"/>
for the peoples marching about the citie, was formerly given him in charge by the Lord, though it be not there expreſſed. However, very obſervable is the peoples readineſſe in obeying his command, which makes it to me moſt probable, that Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua had told them what the Lord had imparted to him, concerning the falling of the citie wall, which they believing the rather, becauſe of the miracle they had ſo lately ſeen of the dividing of Jordan, were the readier to do what Joſhua enjoyned them, and thence is that which the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 11.30. <hi>By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compaſſed about ſeven dayes.</hi> It is queſtioned by ſome, why thoſe Iſraelites were armed that went before the ark, ſeeing the wall was to fall of it ſelf? But this ſcruple is altogether cauſeleſſe, for it was fit they ſhould be armed for their own defence, and the defence of the ark, in caſe the inhabitants ſhould ſally out upon them: and beſides, they were to go up, upon the citie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the inhabitants, ſo ſoon as ever the wall was fallen, and their going armed beforehand, did teſtifie that they believed what God had ſaid herein, and were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to execute the Lords command. The greateſt difficulty in theſe words is, who are here meant by <hi>the rereward that came after the ark?</hi> Some hold that this is meant of the tribes of Dan, Aſher, and Naphtali, and that becauſe, Numb. 10.25. their camp is called <hi>the rereward,</hi> and uſed alwayes as the Iſraelites travelled through the wilderneſſe to march in the rere, which order they conceive was here obſerved for the greater pomp and ſtate. But yet becauſe the words ſeem ſo plainly to imply, that all the people that were armed went before the ark; <hi>Let him that is armed paſſe on before the ark of the Lord,</hi> verſ. 7. and here again, <hi>the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets,</hi> therefore it may ſeem more probable which others ſay, that by <hi>rereward,</hi> here is meant the remainder of the people that were not armed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Joſhua ſaid unto the people, Shout,</hi> &amp;c.] The following reaſon, <hi>for the Lord hath given you the citie,</hi> ſhows the ground why this ſhouting was enjoyned them, to wit, firſt, to ſtrike the hearts of the men of Jericho with fear: ſecondly, to teſtifie their faith in Gods promiſe, and their joyfull aſſurance that now the citie ſhould be delivered up unto them: and thirdly, to encourage one another in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing aſſault.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the city ſhall be accurſed, even it, and all that are therein, to the Lord.]</hi> This Joſhua received in charge from the Lord, though it were not formerly expreſſed, as is evident, 1. Kings 16.34. <hi>In his dayes did Hiel, the Bethelite, build Jericho: he laid the foundation in Abiram his firſt-born, and ſet up the gates thereof in his youngeſt ſonne Segub, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Joſhua the ſonne of Nun.</hi> And by Joſhua no doubt this charge was given to the people, before the time when they were to ſhout: but here it is inſerted, vvhen it vvas to be put in execution, to make vvay to the follovving ſtory of Achans tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, chap. 7. Why this citie vvas thus deſtroyed rather then the other cities vve need not enquire, ſince it is enough that it pleaſed God ſo to appoint. But probably, tvvo reaſons may be given: firſt, that hereby the other inhabitants might be vvarned not to ſtand out againſt God, or if they did, to render them the more inexcuſable: and ſecondly, that it might be offered to the divine juſtice as a kind of firſt-fruits, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42229:17"/>
the words implie, <hi>the citie ſhall be accurſed to the Lord;</hi> thereby acknowledging that the whole land was his, but that he was pleaſed to give it them. As concerning things accurſed or devoted, ſee the notes upon Levit. 27.28.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>But all the ſilver and gold, and veſſels of braſſe and iron, are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto the Lord.]</hi> Under theſe we may probably conceive that all other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls are comprehended, and happely they were made to paſſe through the fire ere they were brought into the Lords treaſurie, as thoſe were, Num. 31.22, 23. <hi>Onely the gold, the ſilver, the braſſe, the iron, the tinne, and the lead, Every thing that may abide the fire, ye ſhall make it go through the fire and it ſhall be clean:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their images of gold and ſilver, there is no queſtion to be made but that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were melted and ſo brought into the treaſurie, or elſe utterly wafted with the things in the citie, according to that law, Deut. 7.25. <hi>The graven images of their gods ſhall ye burn with fire; thou ſhalt not deſire the ſilver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, leſt thou be ſnared therein: for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>The wall fell down flat, ſo that the people went up into the citie,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus God without the help of the Iſraelites beat down the walls of Jericho, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Iſraelites were to have no part of the ſpoil. See the former note upon verſ. 5.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of Iſrael.]</hi> That is, having fetched Rahab, her kindred, and all ſhe had out of her houſe, they carried them to ſome place without their camp, and there they left them. And thus both the Iſraelites teſtified what an eſteem they had of the holineſſe of their camp where God was pleaſed to dwell amongſt them; and withall, Rahab and her kindred were hereby taught to acknowledge bewail and forſake the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their gentile condition; and were kept as aliens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, till they had made profeſſion of their deſire to imbrace the religion and faith of Iſrael, and were cleanſed from their former pollutions according to the Law, Numb. 31.19. <hi>And do ye abide without the camp ſeven dayes: whoſoever hath killed any perſon, and whoſoever hath touched any ſlain, purifie both your ſelves and your captives on the third day and on the ſeventh day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And they burnt the citie with fire and all that was therein.]</hi> It might well in reaſon have been very grievous to the people to deſtroy ſuch goodly houſes wherein they might ſo conveniently have ſeated themſelves, and the whole prey and ſpoil of ſo fair a citie, which might ſo greatly have enriched them. But herein is noted their obſervable obedience at preſent to the Lords command, not a man of them offering to meddle with one jot of the ſpoil, ſave onely Achan, of whoſe ſacriledge we have the relation in the following chapter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Curſed be the man before the Lord, that riſeth up and buildeth this citie Jericho.]</hi> God would have the ruines of this town remain as a perpetuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of the power of God ſhewed both in his ſeveritie againſt this idolatrous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and his mercie to his people; and therefore Joſhua is by the Lord appointed to curſe him that ſhould by building this citie again as it were blot out the memoriall of this miraculous work. For that Joſhua pronounced this curſe by Gods command is evident 1. Kings 16.34. <hi>In his dayes did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42229:18"/>
the foundation thereof in Abiram his first-born, and ſet up the gates thereof in his youngeſt ſonne Segub, according to the word of the Lord which he ſpake by Joſhua the ſonne of Nun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſhall lay the foundation thereof in his firſt-born, and in his youngeſt ſonne ſhall he ſet up the gates of it.]</hi> That is, let it coſt him the loſſe of all his children: the firſt when he begins it, the other as he goeth forward with the work, and the laſt when he finiſheth it. For the hanging up the gates is counted as it were the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a citie. How this curſe fell upon Hiel the Bethelite who in Ahabs reigne built this citie again, is noted in the place before cited, 1. Kings 16.34.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t the children of Iſrael committed a treſpaſſe in the accurſed thing.]</hi> That is, one of the Iſraelites. The people being conſidered <hi>conjunctim,</hi> as one entire body, that which was done by one of the members is here aſcribed to the whole body of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Achan the ſonne of Carmi, the ſonne of Zabdi, the ſonne of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accurſed thing.]</hi> This Achan is alſo called Achar, 1. Chron. 2.7. which ſignifieth <hi>a troubler,</hi> whence he is called there <hi>Achar the troubler of Iſrael,</hi> as likewiſe the place where he was ſtoned is called <hi>the valley of Achar,</hi> that is, of trouble, verſ. 26. of this chapter. Partly the better to evidence the certain truth of the hiſtorie, and partly to implie the ſtain he brought upon his anceſtours, his genealogie is here ſet down, to wit, that Carmi was his father, and ſo Zabdi, who is alſo called Zimri, 1. Chron. 2.6. his grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Zerah or Zarah, who was the ſonne of Judah, Gen. 38.30. was his great grandfather. Indeed conſidering that Zerah was at leaſt fourteen years old when he went with his father Judah and his grandfather Jacob into Egypt, about the yeare of the world 2298. (as by computation of years gathered from the hiſtorie of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may be made evident) and that from their going down into Egypt, unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Jericho are uſually reckoned at the leaſt two hundred fiftie and ſix years, it may well ſeem ſtrange that in all this time there ſhould be but foure gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Zerah the ſonne of Judah being but the great grandfather of Achan. But this doubt may well be ſatisfied by yielding that each of theſe that are mentioned were born in their fathers latter dayes. For if Zerah begat Zabdi when he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie and one years old, fiftie ſeven years after his going into Egypt, in the yeare of the world 2355. and Zabdi begat Carmi at ſeventie years old in the yeare of the world 2425. and Carmi begat Achan alſo at ſeventie years old in the yeare of the world 2495. then was Achan at their coming out of Egypt nineteen years old, and at the ſacking of Jericho about fiftie nine or threeſcore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt the children of Iſrael.]</hi> To wit, becauſe Iſrael had ſinned, as it is ſaid before: And indeed as in the bodie we uſe to beat the back for any offence committed by the tongue; ſo in bodies politick, civill ſocieties, it is no wonder that God ſhould lay upon any of the members temporall puniſhments for a ſinne committed by another of that body; eſpecially if we conſider that God may have alwayes juſt cauſe to puniſh any of his people for ſinne in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42229:18"/>
though for the preſent he take occaſion to ſtrike for the ſinne of another, that men may learn to hate ſinne the more, which brings ruine upon more many times then the ſinner himſelf, and be the more ſtudious to bring others to fear God as themſelves do.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And Joſhua ſent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beſides Beth-aven, on the east ſide of Beth-el,</hi> &amp;c.] This Ai in Gen. 12.8. is written Hai, and Nehem. 11.31. Aijah. It is ſaid here to have been near both to Beth-el and Beth-aven; Beth-el therefore was not farre from Beth-aven which ſignifieth <hi>the houſe of vanity,</hi> or <hi>of a lie;</hi> and in regard whereof it was that when Jeroboam had ſet up his idols in Beth-el, by ſignification <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> the prophets were wont to call it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorn by the name of this neighbour town Beth-aven, <hi>the houſe of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Hoſ. 4.15. <hi>Though thou Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend, and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor ſwear, The Lord liveth.</hi> &amp; 10.5. <hi>The inhabitants of Samaria ſhall fear becauſe of the calves of Beth-aven.</hi> Now to this Ai Joſhua ſent ſpies as before to Jericho, yet theſe men were not to go into Ai, as before into Jericho, but into the countrey about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t where they might view the paſſages, and obſerve afarre off the ſtrength and fortifications of the city; <hi>Go up,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>view the countrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And they returned to Joſhua and ſaid unto him, Let not all the people go up,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus by the confidence and reſolution of theſe men, and by their ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ai as a place of no ſtrength, that might eaſily be taken by a few of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, the Lord did ſecretly make way to that which he had purpoſed to do in the chaſtiſing of the Iſraelites for the ſinne of Achan. Doubtleſſe the ſpies ſpake what they thought, to wit, that it was needleſſe to carry up the whole hoſt of Iſrael againſt ſo ſmall a city as Ai was, <hi>Let about two or three thouſand go up,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and ſmite Ai, and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.</hi> But God had a further end in this which they knew not of; namely, that the Iſraelites might be ſmitten by the men of Ai (whereas had all the armie of Iſrael gone up, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Ai would not have dared to have ſallied out,) and withall, that this might be done but to a ſmall company of the Iſraelites to ſpeak of, that the loſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour might be the leſſe. And hence it was too, that Joſhua and the reſt did ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently approve of this advice of the ſpies, whenas otherwiſe much might have been ſaid againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>So there went up thither of the people about three thouſand men, and they fled before the men of Ai.]</hi> Notwithſtanding the men of Ai were doubtleſſe, as the reſt of the inhabitants of Canaan, greatly dejected with fear of the Iſraelites, and the Iſraelites on the other ſide much imboldned with the late wonders God had wrought for them, and particularly with the overthrow and deſtruction of Jericho, and though they went not raſhly againſt this city (for he had ſent ſpies beforehand to ſearch out the paſſages and advantages of the countrey, and whereas the ſpies had adviſed to ſend <hi>two or three thouſand,</hi> he had for the better aſſurance pitched upon the greater number, to wit, <hi>three thouſand,</hi> and thoſe no doubt of his choiceſt ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) yet when the men of Ai ſallied out, the Iſraelites fled preſently before them: which ſhews plainly, that God being offended did in an ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raordinary manner ſtrike them with aſtoniſhment and fear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42229:19"/>Verſ. 5. <hi>For they chaſed them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and ſmote them in the going down.]</hi> That is, in the deſcent of a hill. So that it ſeems the Iſraelites fled at the firſt on-ſet, before a man was ſlain of them, being ſtricken with a ſtrange fear, and were onely ſlain flying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water.]</hi> That is, the whole people of Iſrael were extremely terrified and diſmaid becauſe of the flight of thoſe forces they had ſent againſt Ai. It is ſtrange alſo indeed that ſo poore a loſſe as this (for there were but ſix and thirty ſlain) ſhould drive the whole camp of Iſrael into ſuch a terrour: But God had withdrawn his ſupporting hand, and in this caſe the moſt ſtout and valiant will ſoon ſhrink and be afraid.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And Joſhua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe the Canaanites had thus put the Iſraelites to flight. The loſſe they had received indeed was nothing to ſpeak of: for what was the loſſe of ſix and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men to them that had ſo many hundred thouſand in their Camp? But alas it was not their loſſe ſo much as the apprehenſion of Gods diſpleaſure that lay ſo heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. God had promiſed that no man ſhould be able to ſtand before them, Chap. 3.16. and that he would without fail drive out the inhabitants of the land before them, Chap. 3.10. their flying therefore now before the enemy, eſpecially in ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious a manner, was to them an argument, that God was offended with them, and ſo had withdrawn himſelf from their help, and hence was this heavy lamentation: even the ſmalleſt affliction, if it be looked upon as an effect of Gods anger, is terrible to the people of God. Wicked men onely grieve for the puniſhment, and therefore ſo long as God viſits them with a more gentle hand by way of warning they never regard it. But the genuine children of God mourn chiefly ſtill for Gods diſpleaſure, which if it be diſcovered by a frown or the leaſt chaſtiſement it wounds them to the heart. Concerning this cuſtome of rending their clothes when they were greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for any thing that befell them, ſee the note upon Gen. 37.29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And put duſt upon their heads.]</hi> This was another expreſſion of grief which the Jews and other nations likewiſe in former times uſed upon any extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſorrow, as we may ſee, 1. Sam. 4.12. Job 2.12. <hi>And when they lift up their eyes afarre off and knew him not, they lift up their voice and wept, and they rent every one his mantle, and ſprinkled duſt upon their heads towards heaven.</hi> Ezek. 27.30. <hi>And ſhall cauſe their voice to be heard againſt thee and ſhall cry bitterly, and ſhall caſt up duſt upon their heads, and ſhall wallow themſelves in the aſhes;</hi> and was practiſed at this time by Joſhua and the elders of Iſrael, 1. by way of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves before God, even to imply what Abraham in expreſſe words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Gen. 18.27. that they were but duſt and aſhes, not worthy to appear before God, or to ſpeak unto him: 2. By way of imploring Gods mercy to them in regard of the frailty of their condition, according to that expreſſion which Job uſeth, Job 10.9. <hi>Remember, I beſeech thee, that thou haſt made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me into duſt again;</hi> and David, Pſal. 103.14. <hi>For he knoweth our frame; he remembreth that we are but duſt:</hi> and 3. By way of repreſenting their miſerable and ſad condition which with words they were not able ſufficiently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, even that they were brought down to the very duſt, to a low and poor and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42229:19"/>
deſpiſed condition, and were indeed in a manner as ſo many dead men.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And Joſhua ſaid, Alas O Lord God, wherefore haſt thou at all brought this people over Jordan,</hi> &amp;c.] Some expoſitours ſeek to give ſuch an interpretation to theſe words, as may wholly clear Joſhua from that which the words ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to wit, an impatient expoſtulation with God for bringing the Iſraelites over Jordan that he might there deliver them into the hands of the Amorites to deſtroy them, and to that end they make the meaning of his words to be onely this, That he deſired to know of God what it was wherewith he had provoked him to deliver them up into the power of their enemies, over whom otherwiſe they ſhould have been victorious, as if he had ſaid, It is not O Lord without cauſe that thou haſt withdrawn thine aſſiſtance from us, and ſuffered theſe uncircumciſed people to put us to ſlight, and therefore make known to us we beſeech thee what the ſinne is whereby we have forfeited thoſe promiſes thou haſt made to us, of driving out the inhabitants of this land before us; And ſo likewiſe they underſtand the following clauſe, <hi>would to God we had been content and dwelt on the other ſide Jordan,</hi> as intended onely to imply how much better it had been for them to have ſtayed in the land without Jordan, then to be brought over Jordan to be deſtroyed by the inhabitants there. And indeed it cannot be well thought that either Joſhua did indeed think that God had brought them over Jordan purpoſely that the Canaanites might there deſtroy them, or that he intended to conteſt and quarrell with God for dealing ſo with him, or that he ſo much as wiſht indeed that they had not come over Jordan. Well, but yet the words do manifeſtly imply more then an humble deſire of knowing what the ſinne was wherewith they had provoked God to let the enemie prevail over them; <hi>Wherefore haſt thou at all brought this people over Jordan,</hi> &amp;c. are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly words of Expoſtulation with God; and therefore I conceive that thus we muſt underſtand them, to wit, that though Joſhua did not think indeed that God had a purpoſe to deliver them into the power of the Canaanites, but meant onely to plead with God for his poore people, that he would not repent of the good he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he would do for them, nor ſuffer the Canaanites to prevail over them, yet in expreſſing his deſire herein, being carried away with his paſſion and ſorrow, he brake forth beyond the bounds of that modeſty and reverence, wherewith it is fit that men ſhould expreſſe their deſires, when they addreſſe themſelves to ſupplicate the great God of heaven and earth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And what wilt thou do unto thy great name?]</hi> To wit, becauſe if thy people be cut off, the idolatrous Canaanites will hereupon take occaſion to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme thy name, ſaying, as Deut. 33.27. <hi>Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this,</hi> or, <hi>the Lord was not able to give them the land which he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them:</hi> and ſo will preferre their idol-gods before the Lord God of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>For they have taken of the accurſed thing, and have alſo ſtollen,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Lord ſets forth the ſeverall degrees of the hainouſneſſe of that ſinne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans, wherewith all Iſrael was involved, for firſt, ſaith the Lord, <hi>they have taken of the accurſed thing,</hi> that is, they have reſerved to themſelves ſome part of that which as an accurſed thing ſhould have been burnt, to wit, the Babyloniſh garment: ſecondly, <hi>they have alſo stollen,</hi> that is, they have taken of that alſo which I reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Sam. 14.41, 42. where the ſame phraſe is uſed, <hi>Saul ſaid unto the Lord God of Iſrael, give a perfect lot, and Saul and Jonathan were taken; And Saul ſaid, Caſt lots between me and Jonathan my ſonne, and Jonathan was taken.</hi> But why did not the Lord tell Joſhua that Achan was the partie that had ſinned, but cauſe him thus to be diſcovered by caſting of lots? I anſwer: firſt, becauſe by this means the Lord tried Achan whether he would come in voluntarily and confeſſe his ſinne; and indeed by Achans holding out ſo long, even till the lot fell upon his own perſon, there was a notable diſcovery made, how hardly men are brought to confeſſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſinnes, and how prone they are to flatter themſelves with a vain hope, that their ſecret ſinnes ſhall never be diſcovered: and ſecondly, becauſe hereby the Lord made known that even the moſt caſuall things, to wit, the caſting of lots are certainly governed by the providence of God, according to that of Solomon, Prov. 16.33. <hi>The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of God:</hi> a truth the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be cleared to this people, becauſe the land was within a ſhort time to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongſt them by lot.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>So Joſhua ſent meſſengers, and they ran unto the tent,</hi> &amp;c.] This run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the meſſengers to Achans tent, to fetch the things ſtollen which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed were hidden there, might well proceed from their eager and earneſt deſire to clear themſelves from the accurſed thing which had kindled Gods anger againſt them: (for they were fetched not onely to diſcover the truth of what Achan confeſſed, but alſo that they might be burnt, as God had commanded verſ. 15.) yet it may be alſo, that God commanded them to runne, leſt any upon Achans confeſſion ſhould get thither and remove them elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And Joſhua and all Iſrael took Achan,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the ſtory relates how Joſhua and the Iſraelites took Achan, with the things he had ſtollen, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all that he had, and carried them down to the valley, called afterwards upon this occaſion, <hi>the valley of Achar,</hi> that they might be there burnt, as God had commanded. Now amongſt other things there being here particular mention made of <hi>his oxen, and his aſſes, and his ſheep,</hi> &amp;c. it may be gathered from thence, that he had before a competent eſtate, and did not therefore ſteal thoſe things for want, which he took out of the ſpoyl of Jericho, but out of mere covetouſneſſe for the further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of himſelf, which was doubtleſſe a great aggravation of his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And all Iſrael stoned them with ſtones, and burned them with fire after they had ſtoned them with ſtones.]</hi> So that both Achan and his ſonnes and daughters were ſtoned.

Gods judgements are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times unſearchable, they are alwayes juſt.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>TAke all the people of warre with thee, and ariſe, go up to Ai,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the citie of Ai were but ſmall, yet all the men of warre were now appointed to go up againſt it, both for the better heartning of the people in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their former aſtoniſhment and fear; as alſo, becauſe they were all to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in taking the ſpoil of the city.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And thou ſhalt do to Ai and her King, as thou didſt unto Jericho and her King.]</hi> That is, as thou didſt burn the city of Jericho, and didſt ſlay the King and inhabitants thereof, ſo ſhalt thou alſo do to the city of Ai, the King and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof. The meaning is not that the ſame ſhould be done in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as was done at Jericho (for we do not reade that the King of Jericho was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the King of Ai was, nor that the rebuilding of Ai was forbidden under a curſe as the rebuilding of Jericho was) but that they ſhould utterly deſtroy the citie and the inhabitants as they did Jericho; indeed it may ſeem ſtrange, why the Lord enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to burn this citie alſo after they had taken the ſpoil thereof, and that becauſe the Lord had formerly promiſed the Iſraelites, that they ſhould <hi>dwell in their cities, and in their houſes,</hi> Deut. 19.1. nor do we reade that after this, they uſed to burn the cities, except it were Hazor, chap. 11.11. But for this, theſe two reaſons are given by Expoſitours, to wit, that God did ſo appoint it, firſt, becauſe as yet God would not have them poſſeſſe any fortified towns or cities, leſt they ſhould put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the ſtrength of theſe places, and not wholly reſt and rely upon God: and ſecondly, becauſe the people being to be led further, to mount Ebal and mount Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim, God would not have them leave this city ſtanding behind them, leſt any of the inhabitants ſhould retire thither, and again fortifie the citie againſt them. As for the encouragement intimated in the mention that is here made of what they had done to Jericho, ſee the note upon a like paſſage in Deut. 3.2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Lay thee an ambuſh for the citie behind it.]</hi> Herein alſo God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the weakneſſe and foregoing fears of the people by giving them hope of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing their enemies not by fine force in a pitched battel, but by this ſecret device and ſtratagem of warre.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>So Joſhua aroſe and all the people of warre to go up against Ai,</hi> &amp;c.] The relation which we have here of the courſe which Joſhua took for the ſurpriſing of Ai is very intricate, ſo that it is indeed very hard to ſay both what company of the Iſraelites went up againſt Ai, and how many of them were laid in ambuſh for the ſurpriſing of the citie, when Joſhua and thoſe that were with him made ſhew of flying before the men of Ai. For firſt, ſome expoſitours are of opinion that all the men of warre in Iſrael, (that is, all in a manner, all except ſome few that were left for the defence of the camp) went up with Joſhua againſt Ai, and that the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he meant to make an aſſault upon the citie, he choſe out thirty thouſand of his ſouldiers whom he ſent away by night giving them in charge to lay themſelves in ambuſh in ſome convenient place <hi>behind the citie,</hi> which was on the weſt ſide of Ai, between Bethel and Ai, which they accordingly did, and that then very early the next morning Joſhua drew up all the reſt of the people that were with him, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42229:21"/>
pitched on a hill on the Northſide of Ai, and being there took other five thouſand men and laid them alſo in ambuſh between Bethel and Ai, as the other were, but (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay they) more northerly and ſomewhat nearer his armie, conceiving that this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh was not laid to ſurpriſe the citie and ſet it on fire as the other was, but for ſome other purpoſe, as happely to fall upon the backs of the enemie to prevent their flying away when Joſhua and thoſe that were with him ſhould turn head againſt them, &amp;c. And indeed according to the plain order of the words this ſeems to have been the courſe that was taken; for here we ſee it is ſaid, that <hi>Joſhua aroſe and all the people of warre to go up against Ai,</hi> and that he <hi>choſe out thirty thouſand mighty men of valour, and ſent them away by night;</hi> and then it follows in the next verſe (which ſeems plainly to have relation to the thirty thouſand before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>And he commanded them, ſaying, Behold ye ſhall lie in wait against the citie, even behind it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I and all the people that are with me will approch unto the citie,</hi> &amp;c. and again, verſ. 9. <hi>Joſhua therefore ſent them forth,</hi> (which ſtill ſeems to be ſpoken of the thirty thouſand before mentioned) <hi>and they went to lie in ambuſh, and abode between Bethel and Ai on the weſt ſide of Ai.</hi> And then afterwards ſpeaking of that which Joſhua did the next morning, verſ. 10, 11, 12. it is ſaid, that <hi>Joſhua roſe up early in the morning,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and all the people of warre that were with him went up and drew nigh and came before the citie, and pitched on the north ſide of Ai,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he took about five thouſand men and ſet them to lie in ambuſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bethel and Ai on the west ſide of the citie.</hi> So that according to the plain letter of the text no man could think at firſt reading but that there were two ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes laid; one of thirty thouſand men, verſ. 3, 4. and another of about five thouſand verſ. 12. Well, but yet others and indeed the moſt and beſt of all Expoſitours do otherwiſe conceive, of that which is here written concerning the ſurpriſing of Ai, namely that Joſhua took onely thirty thouſand in all with him to go againſt Ai, and that there was no other ambuſh laid between Bethel and Ai but that of the five thouſand mentioned verſ. 12. And the reaſons which move them thus to conceive of this paſſage of the ſtorie are very conſiderable, to wit, firſt, Becauſe had they carried all the men of warre of Iſrael againſt Ai, which were many hundred thouſands, it is not likely that the men of Ai would have adventured to ſallie out againſt them; ſecondly, Becauſe the place aſſigned for the ambuſh both verſ. 4. and verſ. 12. is the very ſame, to wit, the weſt ſide of Ai, between Bethel and Ai; nor can any probable reaſon be given either why two ſeverall ambuſhes ſhould be laid on the ſame ſide of the citie, or how ſuch a mighty number of armed men, as firſt thirtie thouſand, and then five thouſand ſhould conveniently be diſpoſed of to lie undiſcovered in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ambuſhes between Ai and Bethel, a town near at hand and confederate with Ai; and thirdly, eſpecially, Becauſe there is no mention made in the ſequel of this ſtorie of any thing that was done for the ſurpriſall of Ai but onely by one ambuſh, who when the men of Ai were purſuing the reſt of the Iſraelites came out, and on a ſudden took the citie, and ſet it on fire. Upon theſe grounds, I ſay, moſt that have written upon this place do hold that there was but one ambuſh laid, to wit, that of five thouſand men mentioned verſ. 12. So that according to this opinion of theirs, whereas it is ſaid here, that <hi>Joſhua choſe out thirty thouſand mighty men of valour,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42229:22"/>
and ſent them away by night, and he commanded them, ſaying, Behold ye ſhall lie in wait againſt the citie,</hi> &amp;c. The words muſt not be ſo underſtood as if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all thoſe thirtie thouſand men to lie in ambuſh behind Ai, but that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them that they ſhould lay ſome in ambuſh, to wit, the five thouſand men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned afterward verſ. 12. And indeed this Expoſition I conceive to be the moſt probable; onely becauſe it is ſo expreſſely ſaid verſ. 1. <hi>Take all the people of warre with thee and ariſe go up to Ai,</hi> and here again, <hi>So Joſhua aroſe and all the people of warre to go up againſt Ai,</hi> I cannot ſee how it can be denied that Joſhua carried the whole armie of Iſrael with him: ſo that thus I think we may beſt conceive of the whole carriage of this expedition againſt Ai, to wit, firſt, That Joſhua marched with all the men of warre from Gilgal till they were come ſo near it that they might the following night go up to the citie, verſ. 3. ſecondly, That he ſent away from thence that night verſ. 3, 4. thirty thouſand of his choiceſt men with a charge that taking the advantage of the night they ſhould lay an ambuſh behind the citie between Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel and Ai, to wit, an ambuſh of five thouſand men, as is afterwards expreſſed verſ. 12. the other five and twentie thouſand being ſent with him, that they ſtaying ſome where not farre from them, might be able to encounter the enemie, in caſe the inhabitants of the citie ſhould diſcover them and come out with all their power againſt them; all which they did accordingly verſ. 9. and <hi>Joſhua lodged that night amongſt</hi> the reſt of <hi>the people.</hi> thirdly, That early the next morning before it was yet day Joſhua went up after this thirtie thouſand and pitched on the north ſide of Ai, (joyning happely now with the five and twentie thouſand that went along with thoſe that were to lie in ambuſh) but in a place where the men of Ai could not yet diſcover them, there being a valley between them and the Iſraelites, verſ. 10, 11. fourthly, Having thus ſet the ambuſh on the weſt ſide of the citie, and the bodie of the armie on the North, Joſhua went preſently before it was day into the midſt of the valley, verſ. 13. purpoſely that the men of Ai might ſee them, and therefore queſtionleſſe he carried with him into this valley but a ſmall party, that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants might be the readier to ſalley out againſt them, and fifthly, That when the men of Ai taking notice thereof, hereupon came out and ſet upon them, and were drawn off farre from the city, by the counterfeit flight of the Iſraelites, hereupon Joſhua made a ſtand, and ſet upon thoſe that purſued them, and withall the ambuſh roſe out of their place, ſurpriſed the city, and ſet it on fire.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the men of the city went out against Iſrael to battell, he and all his people at a time appointed,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they all came together <hi>at a time appointed</hi> from all the ſeverall parts of the city, and at the ſelf ſame time ruſhed all out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſet upon the Iſraelites with great violence. When Joſhua came into the valley with that ſmall company he brought with him, he deſired there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of it, ſo that happely by the noiſe they made they might be diſcovered; whereof when word was brought to the King, he appointed that all the Garriſon ſouldiers in the city ſhould be in readineſſe at ſuch a time, that they might go out againſt the Iſraelites, and accordingly <hi>at the time appointed</hi> (which ſhews how forward they were by reaſon of their former victory) they were all met, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their King, did ſally forth and ſet upon them.</p>

This wilderneſſe therefore here mentioned was it ſeems in that place, and we may probably conceive, that it was <hi>the wilderneſſe of Beth-aven;</hi> for that was nigh unto Bethel, chap. 18.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And all the people that were in Ai were called together to purſue after them.]</hi> That is, all the ſouldiers, all that could bear arms: for that others were left in the city, is evident verſ. 24. <hi>All the Iſraelites returned unto Ai, and ſmote it with the edge of the ſword.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And there was not a man left in Ai, or Bethel,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems Bethel being but a little town, and confederate with Ai, the inhabitants at the firſt approch of the Iſraelites, had forſaken it, as having no hope to be able to keep it, and had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their power to that of Ai, to make that the ſtronger. And hence Bethel is alſo mentioned with Ai, the text telling of us that <hi>there was not a man left,</hi> that is, a ſouldier, <hi>neither in Ai, or Bethel;</hi> becauſe from Bethel they were come to Ai, and now altogether were gone out in the purſuit of the Iſraelites. Yet if we conſider how cloſely the ambuſh of the Iſraelites might be laid in ſome woods, or ſome other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of covert betwixt Bethel and Ai, I ſee not why we may not conceive that the Garriſon of Ai, ſeeing the Iſraelites fly again, either by poſt ſent thither, or by ſome ſigne given them, called forth the men of Bethel to joyn with them in the purſuit of the Iſraelites. How Bethel came to be long after this in the poſſeſſion of the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, ſee the note upon Judg. 1.24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Joſhua, Stretch out the spear that is in thine hand towards Ai.]</hi> This God enjoyned him to do, as a ſigne to the people that they ſhould now make a ſtand, and with aſſurance that God would deliver the city into their hand, ſhould now again make head againſt the enemie, from whom they had ſeemed to fly; as even in theſe times, the captain ſtretching forth his ſpear or ſtaffe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42229:23"/>
upon the face of the enemie, is a ſigne to the ſouldiers of reinforcing the battell.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And the ambuſh roſe quickly out of their place, and they ranne as ſoon as he had ſtretched out his hand.]</hi> How they that lay covertly in the ambuſh on the Weſt ſide of the city, ſhould among ſo many thouſand diſcern Joſhua his ſpear ſtretched out, now eſpecially when by a ſeeming flight they had drawn the enemie ſo farre from the city, I cannot conceive; and therefore I rather think that upon this ſigne given by Joſhua, his ſouldiers gave a ſhout, or the muſicall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments gave warning, for reinforcing the battell, and hereby the ſpies knew it was time to enter the city.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And they haſted, and entered into the city and took it, and haſted and ſet it on fire.]</hi> That is, ſome houſe in the city, that by the ſmoke thereof, the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites might perceive the city was taken. See the following note.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 24. <hi>All the Iſraelites returned unto Ai, and ſmote it with the edge of the ſword.]</hi> That is, the men and women and children left in the city; for they had before onely ſet fire on ſome one place of the city, that thereby it might be known they had taken it: but now upon Joſhuas coming, after they had ſlain thoſe in the field, they entered the city, ſlew all that were found in it, took away the ſpoyl, and then burnt the city wholly with fire to the ground, verſ. 28.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And ſo it was, that all that fell that day both of men and women were twelve thouſand, even all the men of Ai.]</hi> That is, ſay ſome Expoſitours, twelve thouſand of the men of Ai, beſides thoſe of Bethel, that joyned with the men of Ai, verſ. 17. againſt the Iſraelites, of whom how many were ſlain it is not expreſſed. But becauſe the number of the ſlain were taken by the Iſraelites, who could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe of Ai, and thoſe of Bethel, even thoſe of Bethel might well be comprehended in thoſe words <hi>even all the men of Ai,</hi> becauſe they were ſlain in this expedition of the Iſraelites againſt Ai.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And Joſhua drew not his hand back, wherewith he ſtretched out the ſpear,</hi> &amp;c.] But ſtill with his ſpear ſtretched forth led them on upon the chaſe and ſlaughter of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And Joſhua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a deſolation unto this day.]</hi> It is evident, that in the dayes of Nehemiah this citie Ai was built again, becauſe we find it named, Neh. 11.31. amongſt the cities that Benjamin dwelt in, though indeed it be not there called Ai, but Aijah; and therefore by this word <hi>for ever</hi> is meant onely, as in many other places of Scripture, a long time. As for that clauſe, <hi>even a deſolation to this day,</hi> ſee the notes upon chap. 3.9.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And as ſoon as the ſunne was down, Joſhua commanded that they ſhould take his carcaſe down from the tree.]</hi> See the note upon Deut. 21.23.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>Then Joſhua built an altar unto the Lord God of Iſrael in mount E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, about this time. Moſes had before his death charged the Iſraelites that when they came into the land of Canaan they ſhould build a monument of great ſtones and write the law thereon, and that at the ſame time they ſhould build an altar of whole ſtones and offer ſacrifices thereon; and that on mount Gerizim and mount Ebal (where this was to be done) the people ſhould in a ſolemn manner give their conſent to certain bleſſings and curſes that ſhould be read in their hearing, as we may reade in the 27. Chapter of Deuteronomy. Here therefore the ſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates now how Joſhua did what Moſes had commanded them. But why did he do it now? or how could he do it now, ſince they were not yet come to mount Geri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim and mount Ebal? I anſwer: Some affirm that theſe mountains were nigh to Ai and Bethel; and others ſay, That though this ſtory be inſerted in this place, yet it was done long after the taking of Ai. But becauſe it is generally held (and not without juſt ground) that Gerizim was in the tribe of Ephraim; which was much further up into the countrey, and withall, that this word <hi>(then)</hi> immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſtory of taking Ai, <hi>Then Joſhua built an altar unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. ſeems plainly to imply, that this was done much about this time; therefore I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive that after the ſacking of Ai Joſhua finding the way to theſe mountains clear and open, by reaſon of the terrour wherewith the enemies were ſtricken, took this opportunity to go up with the people thither there to perform this ſervice, which upon the firſt opportunity they had, he knew they were bound to perform. And indeed we may well think that the deſtroying of theſe two towns of Jericho and Ai (the bulworks of their countrey on that ſide) did at firſt mightily diſmay the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, though within a while they began to combine themſelves together againſt the Iſraelites, as is related in the beginning of the following chapter. What is further ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known concerning this monument of ſtones and the altar that was built with it, we may ſee in the notes upon the 11. and 27. chapters of Deuteronomy.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>And he wrote there upon the ſtones a copy of the law of Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.] Not the ſtones of the altar, but ſtones erected for that very purpoſe that the law might be written on them, as we may ſee Deuteronomy 27. where there is ſeverall directions given firſt for theſe ſtones, then for the altar.</p>

Their city was great and ſtrong, Chap. 10.2. and it ſeems they had other neighbouring towns under their government, to wit, Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirioth-jearim, verſ. 17. of this chapter, who were therefore alſo comprehended
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42229:24"/>
in the covenant made with the Iſraelites. It is ſaid, verſe 1. that the hearing of that which Joſhua had done to Jericho and Ai, was the occaſion that moved the kings there mentioned to enter into a confederacy of joyning together <hi>to fight with Joſhua and with Iſrael with one accord,</hi> and yet here it is ſaid, that the ſame report of the deſtruction of Jericho moved the Gibeonites to come in and ſubmit themſelves to Joſhua and the Iſraelites, and to ſeek from them conditions of peace; which ſhews plainly that it was of God, and not of themſelves, that theſe Gibeonites were thus wiſely carefull to provide for their own ſafety. Doubtleſſe the ſame report that brought the other Canaanites the news of the deſtruction of Jericho, did alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them how it was taken, and told them the miraculous fall of their walls and fortreſſes, and yet they reſolved to fight againſt them, which was no other then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to fight againſt God; which ſhews, that God had hardened their hearts to their deſerved ruine. On the other ſide, the Gibeonites, though they had as much reaſon becauſe of the greatneſſe of their city to truſt in their ſtrength as any people of the land had, yet when they heard what was done to Jericho and Ai, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that there was no reſiſting ſuch a people, and therefore determined to try if they could make peace with them; and whence could this be but of God, who taught them to make a better uſe of theſe wonderfull works of God then their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours had done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And took old ſacks upon their aſſes, and wine bottles, old and rent and bound up.]</hi> That is, mended and patched up with peices that were ſown in where they had been broken.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And they went to Joſhua to the Camp at Gilgal.]</hi> This makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that even after the taking of Jericho the Camp of the Iſraelites was ſtill at Gilgal. It ſeems, becauſe it was a place of ſome ſtrength, and becauſe they deſired not to remove too farre from their brethren whom they had left without Jordan till they had in ſome good meaſure cleared the countrey before them; here they kept their ſtanding Camp for divers years, and onely ſent out parties from thence againſt the inhabitants in ſeverall parts as occaſion was offered. As for the plea they uſed, to move the Iſraelites to make peace with them, to wit, that they dwelt in a countrey farre beyond Canaan, <hi>We be come from a farre countrey now therefore make ye a league with us,</hi> it proceeded doubtleſſe, from ſome aſſurance they had that the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites were come to drive them out, and dwell in their land, as alſo from a common fame that was ſpread abroad, that God had forbidden them to make any peace with the inhabitants of the land, as appears evident verſe 24. <hi>And they anſwered Joſhua, and ſaid, Becauſe it was certainly told thy ſervants, how that the Lord thy God commanded his ſervant Moſes to give you all the land, and to deſtroy all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the land before you.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Peradventure ye dwell among us, and how ſhall we make a league with you?]</hi> That is, peradventure ye dwell in this land whereof we are come to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and then we may not make a league with you to let you dwell among us. And indeed, God had expreſſely forbidden them the making of peace with any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Canaan; to wit, (for ſo I conceive we muſt underſtand it) unleſſe when they yielded to imbrace the Religion of Iſrael; as we may ſee Exod. 23.32, 33. <hi>Thou
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42229:24"/>
ſhalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods; they ſhall not dwell in thy land,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo again, Exod. 34.12. Deut. 7.2. and in many other places. Even where God appointed them to tender peace to other cities before they proceeded to deſtroy them, there is an exception made of the cities of Canaan, Deut. 20.15, 16. <hi>Thus ſhalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of theſe nations.

                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And they ſaid unto Joſhua, we be thy ſervants.]</hi> The laſt words of the Iſraelites in the foregoing verſe, <hi>how ſhall we make a league with you?</hi> they might underſtand as ſpoken by way of inquiring what kind of league they deſired to have with them, and that hereupon turning to Joſhua, (whom they obſerved to be the Generall for the reſt) they anſwered, <hi>we be thy ſervants,</hi> that is, ready to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and to receive whatever conditions you ſhall think fit to grant us. But however theſe words doubtleſſe they uſed to imply not onely that they were friends and not enemies, as their neighbours were, but alſo that they were willing to accept of any conditions of peace.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>For we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in Egypt.]</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in amongſt other things they diſcovered their ſubtilty that they make no mention of the Iſraelites taking of Ai and Jericho, which their citizens could not ſo ſoon have heard of, if they lived as they pretended in a countrey ſo farre remote from that place, but onely what was done in Egypt, and againſt Sihon, and Og, which being long ſince done, the ſame thereof might be well in this time carried to a land farre off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the borders of Canaan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counſell at the mouth of the Lord.]</hi> That is, they took them and looked upon them, and through too much credulity ranne away with a conceit, that this plainly ſhewed the truth of what they had ſaid; never inquiring of God what an anſwer they ſhould give them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Joſhua made peace with them, and made a league with them that that they ſhould live.]</hi> Which he might lawfully do, ſuppoſing them not to be the inhabitants of Canaan, Deut. 20.10, 11. <hi>When thou comeſt nigh a city to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, then proclaim peace unto it. And it ſhall be, if it make thee anſwer of peace, and open unto thee, then it ſhall be that all the people that is found therein ſhall be tributaries unto thee, and ſhall ſerve thee.</hi> And again, verſe 15, 16. <hi>Thus ſhalt thou do to the cities which are farre off from thee, which are not of the cities of theſe nations. But of the cities of theſe people which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou ſhalt ſave alive nothing that breatheth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And it came to paſſe that at the end of three dayes, after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added to ſet forth the folly of their unadviſed raſhneſſe, who without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation do preſently make a covenant with the Gibeonites, whereas if they had but deferred their anſwer even for a day or two they had found out the truth, and had not been ſo gulled and abuſed as now they were.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And the children of Iſrael ſmote them not, becauſe the Princes of the Congregations had ſworn unto them by the Lord God of Iſrael.]</hi> That the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42229:25"/>
did well in ſparing the Gibeonites, becauſe of the oath which their Princes had taken, and that they had ſinned greatly if they had ſlain them, is evident 2. Sam. 21.1, 2. where we reade, that God ſent a famine upon the land, becauſe Saul foure hundred years after this had ſlain ſome of the Gibeonites, and ſo brake the oath which their fathers had now obtained of Joſhua and the Iſraelites, and yet Saul did it too <hi>in his zeal to the children of Iſrael and Judah.</hi> If it be objected that the Gibeonites had fraudulently drawn the Princes into that oath, and therefore there was no reaſon why they ſhould be tied thereby to that which they never intended, for they had covenanted to grant peace to a people that dwelt far off, and the Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites were of the inhabitants of the land, ſo that this covenant made with them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe terms, was of it ſelf void and of none effect: to this I anſwer, That though when men are drawn by force or fraud into any promiſe or covenant, they are not bound to keep that promiſe or covenant, and that becauſe he to whom the promiſe or covenant is made (with whom onely we have to do in this caſe) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any rule of equity challenge any right to that which he hath obtained by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or violence; yet when men do confirm any ſuch promiſe or covenant by oath, the caſe is otherwiſe, becauſe they are bound then to God, and not to the man onely that uſed ſuch fraud and violence, whoſe wickedneſſe in ſo drawing them into an oath cannot make void the engagement that lieth upon them that have ſworn in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God. And if it be again objected, as it is by many, That the Princes had ſworn to do that which was againſt the expreſſe command of God, who had often enjoyned them to deſtroy all the inhabitants of Canaan, and not to make any league of peace with them, as is noted before upon verſ. 7. to this I anſwer too, That though an oath or vow doth not bind men for the doing of any thing that is abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, yet in this caſe it was not ſo, and that becauſe the charge which God had given them for ſlaying all the inhabitants of the land was a particular command, &amp; ſo farre onely to bind their conſciences as it might be obeyed without any breach of the Morall Law, as in Rahabs caſe is alſo evident. But here they could not obey that command of Gods concerning their deſtroying all the inhabitants of Canaan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perjury, which is directly againſt the law and light of nature; and beſides, it would have given the heathen great occaſion of blaſpheming the name of the Lord, if they had ſworn in his name and had not kept it: all which muſt needs lie as a ſtrong bond upon the conſciences of the Iſraelites, ſtrictly to obſerve this oath though they were deluded by the Gibeonites: for in this that rule holds good, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>But let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water unto all the congregation.]</hi> That is, for the uſe of all the congregation to provide wood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they were to uſe in their ſacrifices: as is evident verſ. 27. <hi>And Joſhua made them that day hewers of wood, and drawers of water for all the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord:</hi> yet becauſe it is certain that the inhabitants of theſe foure cities, could not dwell in any one place where the Tabernacle was ſeated, nor yet in Jeruſalem when the Temple was built, but were ſeverally diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the land, coming up happely in their courſes as the Levites did, to do their ſervice in the houſe of God; I ſhould think it moſt probable, that in the time when they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42229:25"/>
waited not at the Tabernacle as publick ſervants, they were alſo imployed in other ſervile offices for the people. Theſe were they that afterwards were called Nethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims, 1. Chron. 9.2. that is, <hi>Deodati,</hi> men given to God, or the publick ſervice of the Tabernacle: for though Ezra 8.20. it is ſaid, that <hi>David and the Princes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Nethinims for the ſervice of the Levites;</hi> yet it is meant onely of the ordering of them, how they ſhould in their ſeverall courſes attend upon that ſervice, for even now they were allotted to this ſervice, and did therein doubtleſſe attend upon the Levites in the ſervice of the Tabernacle, from this time unto the dayes of David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Now therefore ye are curſed, and there ſhall none of you be freed from being bondmen,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe words, <hi>Now therefore ye are curſed,</hi> the moſt of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours underſtand of the curſe or puniſhment of bondage, which for their diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and fraudulent dealing they were adjudged to undergo, and ſo they take the following words, <hi>and there ſhall none of you be freed from being bondmen,</hi> to be an explanation of the words that went before; but it is better underſtood of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall curſe which God had laid upon all the inhabitants of Canaan, to wit, as if Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua had ſaid, The curſe which God hath pronounced againſt the people of this land, requires that you ſhould be cut off as well as the reſt; yet becauſe of the oath which we have taken, this curſe ſhall be upon you in bondage, and not in death. And indeed here was that curſe literally fulfilled in the Gibeonites, which Noah pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the Canaanites in generall, Gen. 9.25. <hi>And he ſaid, Curſed be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan: a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be unto his brethren.</hi>

Nor need it ſeem ſtrange that they ſhould reſolve thus firſt to begin with them; Firſt, becauſe as the timely ſurpriſing of theſe cities of the Gibeonites would be a notable means to ſecure their own cities; ſo the delivering them up to the Iſraelites would open a way to their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ruine. Secondly, becauſe it was fit that ſome ſpeedy courſe ſhould be taken to make all other cities afraid to fall off to the Iſraelites as the Gibeonites had done. Thirdly, becauſe they were not ſo afraid to encounter with theſe their neighbours, as with the Iſraelites, and hope that by prevailing againſt theſe, they ſhould both daunt the Iſraelites, and encourage their own people: and, Fourthly, becauſe their wrath againſt theſe neighbours for revolting from them was ſo exceeding great, that in caſe they ſhould weaken themſelves by ſpending their forces upon them, yet ſo they might be revenged upon them firſt, they did not ſo much care.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the men of Gibeon ſent to Joſhua to the camp to Gilgal, ſaying, Slack not thy hand,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, before they were beſieged, ſo ſoon as they heard theſe kings were coming againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>So Joſhua aſcended from Gilgal, he and all the people of warre with him,</hi> &amp;c.] Conſidering how little aſſurance Joſhua could have that the Gibeonites would not ſome way deal treacherouſly with him, and what cauſe he had to fear leſt his own ſouldiers ſhould not be very chearfully forward to fight for the defence of thoſe, whom themſelves ere-while would have deſtroyed, it is much that Joſhua ſhould thus readily go to aid the Gibeonites. But then on the other ſide, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of how great importance it was for the Iſraelites, to get the cities of the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites into their power, and how alſo in point of conſcience Joſhua was bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, that had now yielded up themſelves to be their ſervants, it will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Joſhua was bound with all ſpeed to go up and raiſe the ſiege of Gibeon, and when he had done his duty herein, to leave the ſucceſſe to God. Yea, and it may be too he enquired of God, and received from him that encouragement ſet down in the following verſe, before he undertook this expedition for the relief of Gibeon, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Joſhua, Fear them not; for I have delivered them into thine hand,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Joſhua therefore came unto them ſuddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.]</hi> To wit, that he might ſurpriſe them ſuddenly; but yet from hence we cannot conclude, that they were but one night a marching from Gilgal to Gibeon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And it came to paſſe, as they fled from before Iſrael, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great ſtones from heaven upon them,</hi> &amp;c.] It is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, that <hi>the Lord chaſed them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon,</hi> and yet here now it is added, that the Lord ſlew them
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42229:26"/>
with hailſtones <hi>as they were in the going down to Beth-horon:</hi> the reaſon whereof may be, becauſe there was an <hi>upper</hi> and a <hi>nether Beth-horon,</hi> 1. Chron. 7.24. by both which it ſeems the Canaanites fled at this time, when they were chaſed by the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites: for though it be ſaid in that place of the Chronicles, that theſe towns were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter built by one Sherah a famous woman of the ſtock of Ephraim, yet we muſt know, that it is uſuall in this ſtory to ſpeak of places in the land of Canaan by the names that were afterwards given them by the Iſraelites; yea, and perhaps too there might be at this time an upper and a nether Beth-horon, though by that Sherah they were afterwards rebuilt, beautified, and fortified: as for this ſtorm of hail that fell upon the Canaanites, it was miraculous in a twofold regard; firſt, in regard of the exceeding greatneſſe of the hailſtones, which were of ſuch a mighty bigneſſe and weight, that they brained and killed the Canaanites upon whom they fell, ſo that <hi>they were more which died with the hailstones, then they which the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſlew with the ſword:</hi> and ſecondly, in regard they were ſo ordered and levelled as I may ſay, by the hand of Gods providence, that though the Iſraelites purſued the Canaanites ſo cloſely, that here and there they muſt needs be mingled amongſt them, yet they onely fell upon the Canaanites, and touched not one of the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Then spake Joſhua unto the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites,</hi> &amp;c.] For the better underſtanding of this miraculous paſſage concerning Joſhuas commanding the ſunne to ſtand ſtill, we muſt know, firſt, That whereas it is ſaid in the firſt place, that <hi>Joſhua spake to the Lord,</hi> thereby is meant, that he did firſt pray unto the Lord, that this miracle might be wrought, and that to the end they might have the more time to purſue and deſtroy the Amorites, and then by the ſame ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods ſpirit that moved him to deſire this of God, being fully aſſured that God had heard his prayer, and that what he deſired ſhould be done, he commanded the ſunne to ſtand ſtill, &amp;c. ſecondly, That whereas in the next clauſe it follows, <hi>and he ſaid in the ſight of all Iſrael, Sunne ſtand thou ſtill,</hi> &amp;c. this is added to ſhew the aſſurance of his faith; becauſe he was ſo undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly perſwaded that God would certainly do what he had prayed for, and deſired the people ſhould take notice of it for their future encouragement, openly in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the people he looked up to the heavens, and ſpeaking as it were to the ſunne, ſaid, <hi>Sunne stand thou ſtill,</hi> &amp;c. and happely with relation to the peoples ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon him, when in ſo ſtrange a manner they ſaw him look up to the ſunne and command the ſunne to ſtand ſtill, this phraſe is uſed, <hi>and he ſaid,</hi> not in the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but <hi>in the ſight of all Iſrael, Sunne ſtand thou ſtill,</hi> &amp;c. thirdly, That for the words themſelves which Joſhua ſpake, <hi>Sunne ſtand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon;</hi> there is nothing can be certainly concluded, but that he did as it were adjure the ſunne and moon by the Almighty power of God, to ſtand ſtill juſt in the place wherein they were when he ſpake unto them, that ſo the ſunne might ſtill give light till they had made an end of purſuing and deſtroying their enemies, and that hereby muſt needs be intended the ſtay of the whole body of the moveable heaven, together with the ſunne and the moon; for it cannot be meant of ſtaying that peculiar motion of the Orbs of the ſunne and moon, whereby they move ſeverally from the weſt to the eaſt (for the lengthening of the day could not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42229:27"/>
depend upon that) but it muſt be meant of the motion of the heaven, whereby the ſunne and moon together with all the other heavenly Orbs, are carried about by the motion of the ſupreme Sphere, in the ſpace of foure and twenty houres from the eaſt to the weſt: Some indeed would conclude from theſe words, that it was at noon day when Joſhua commanded the ſunne to ſtand ſtill, namely, becauſe it was when the ſunne was right over Gibeon, as the words they ſay implie, <hi>Sunne stand thou ſtill upon Gibeon;</hi> and that therefore alſo it is ſaid verſ. 13. <hi>ſo the ſunne ſtood ſtill in the midſt of heaven,</hi> and then they take the next clauſe to be added, <hi>and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon,</hi> by way of expreſſing the ſame thing in other words, to wit, that the moon alſo ſhould ſtand ſtill and not bring in night upon them. Again, others would inferre from theſe words that it was towards ſunneſet when Joſhua commanded the ſunne to ſtand ſtill; and that firſt, Becauſe it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the fear of want of daylight to purſue the enemie when he ſaw the ſunne decline apace towards its ſetting, was the occaſion that moved Joſhua to deſire this miraculous ſtay of the ſunne: and ſecondly, Becauſe the words ſeem to implie that he ſaw the moon alſo, when he ſaid, <hi>and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon;</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed about the new of the moon it is uſually ſeen towards ſunne-ſetting. But I ſay, neither of theſe can be gathered from the text. The drift doubtleſſe of Joſhua was onely to expreſſe that the heavenly Orbs ſhould ſtand ſtill to the end the ſunne might not ſet but continue ſtill to give them light in thoſe parts, onely the more rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically to ſet forth the wonder of the miracle, he mentions both ſunne and moon the two great lights of heaven together with Gibeon and Ajalon two places not farre diſtant one from another; <hi>Sunne ſtand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon.</hi>

                     <hi>None moved his tongue againſt any of the children of Iſrael.]</hi> This is a prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall ſpeech; but the meaning is, that the Canaanites durſt not make the leaſt reſiſtance againſt the Iſraelites that purſued them: ſo farre they were from lifting up a hand againſt them, that they ſcarſe durſt mutter againſt them.

                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Come near, put your feet upon the necks of theſe kings.]</hi> This Joſhua enjoyned his Captains to do, not out of a cruel proud inſulting mind, but firſt, to teach them that they were to ſhew no mercy to this people: ſecondly, to encourage and hearten the Captains for the time to come, as by intimating that thus they ſhould tread all their enemies under their feet, verſ. 25. <hi>And Joſhua ſaid unto them, Fear not not nor be diſmaid, be ſtrong and of good courage: for thus ſhall the Lord do to all your enemies, againſt whom ye fight:</hi> thirdly, to manifeſt Gods ſingular love to them, and precious eſteem of them, who was pleaſed to let them tread upon the necks of kings: and fourthly, that this formidable ſight might make them fear to imitate the manners of this people againſt whom God had ſhown ſuch ſeverity. Yea, in this was Joſhua a type of Chriſt, who doth tread Satan under the feet of his people, Rom. 16.20. in and through whom we are more then conquerours, Rom. 8.37. yea, even over thoſe principalities and powers, whom having ſpoyled, <hi>he made a ſhew of them, openly triumphing over them,</hi> Col. 2.15.</p>

Had theſe kings here mentioned joyned with the other five, whom the Iſraelites had before vanquiſhed, the Iſraelites muſt needs be ſtricken with great terrour and fear: And therefore the Lord was pleaſed ſo to infatuate and ſtupifie theſe, that they were quiet, and moved not till their neighbours were deſtroyed; by which means the Iſraelites were heartned with the conqueſt of the firſt, ere the other ſet upon them, and they had leiſure to refreſh themſelves in their camp at Gilgal, ere they were called forth to go upon another ſervice.</p>

onely his death is related here where the ſtory relates how his city was taken, as is noted before upon a like paſſage, chap. 10.37. which laſt ſeems the moſt probable, becauſe the like is ſaid afterward concerning all the kings that were confederate with Jabin in this warre, verſe 12. <hi>And all the cities of thoſe kings, and all the kings of them did Joſhua take, and ſmote them with the edge of the ſword.</hi> For it is not probable, that all thoſe kings did eſcape to their cities, and were taken and ſlain there, or that there were new kings choſen in the room of thoſe that were ſlain in all thoſe cities. As concerning the rebuilding &amp; repeopling again of this Hazor, whoſe kings were happely called by the name of Jabin, as thoſe of Egypt were called Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs, ſee what is noted upon Judges 4.2. where we reade of another Jabin that reigned <hi>in Hazor,</hi> that did mightily oppreſſe Gods people.</p>

Some it ſeems in the taking put the Iſraelites to more work, and were burnt and deſtroyed ere they could be wonne; but thoſe that could be taken otherwiſe, the Iſraelites reſerved for their own uſe: Onely Hazor, though after it was taken it ſtood ſtill in its ſtrength, was burnt down to the ground, becauſe the king thereof was the firſt and chief in raiſing theſe forces, which were now overthrown, againſt the Iſraelites.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Joſhua made warre a long time with all thoſe kings.]</hi> Becauſe the warres which Joſhua had made with the kings of Canaan mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter are ſuccinctly related in a few words, it might therefore be thought that they were diſpatched in a few dayes, and therefore to prevent this miſtake, it is here expreſſely ſaid that theſe warres laſted a long time, though they be here brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related one immediately after another. How many years were ſpent in ſubduing theſe nations we cannot ſay; onely it is evident that when Caleb required of Joſhua that part of the land which Moſes had promiſed him chap. 14.6. the warres had laſted about ſeven years; for that was five and fourtie years, as Caleb ſaith there, verſ. 10. after he with others were ſent from Kadeſh-barnea to ſearch the land of Canaan; out of which if we take eight and thirtie yeares, which were after that ſpent in the wandring of the Iſraelites through the wilderneſſe, there will remain ſeven years, which were ſpent in the warres of Joſhua, from the time that they paſſed over Jordan unto the time that Caleb deſired of Joſhua that peculiar portion of the land which had been promiſed him. We know well that God could many wayes have driven or rooted out theſe kings and their people in a ſhorter time: But God would have it thus done by degrees, firſt, That the more oppoſition and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42229:29"/>
difficultie they found in the work, the more the power and the love of God and his provident care over them might be magnified, who did at laſt carrie them through all theſe difficulties. Secondly, that he might hereby exerciſe their faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and teach them whenever they met with great oppoſition in any thing God enjoyned them, not to deſpair, but to wait upon God, as knowing that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion God would not ſuffer their hope to make them aſhamed. Thirdly, that the obſtinacy of the Canaanites might be the more clearly diſcovered to render them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. and Fourthly, that he might prevent hereby the encreaſe of wild beaſts in the land, according to that which Moſes had ſaid to them, Deut. 7.22. <hi>The Lord thy God will put out thoſe nations before thee by little and little, thou mayest not conſume them at once, lest the beaſts of the field encreaſe upon thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added as a reaſon why the warres with the Canaanites laſted ſo long, as it is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, it was becauſe the inhabitants did all ſo obſtinately ſtand it out againſt the Iſraelites, none of them attempting to procure conditions of peace from them, ſave onely the Gibeonites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Exod. 7.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And at that time came Joſhua and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, and from Debir,</hi> &amp;c.] Concerning theſe Anakims, ſee what is noted before upon Numb. 13.22. where it is alſo expreſſely ſaid, that the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites that were at firſt ſent to ſearch the land of Canaan, ſaw theſe Anakims about Hebron, from whence Joſhua did now drive them. It is evident that Hebron, (yea and Debir too, or elſe another city of the ſame name) was formerly taken by Joſhua and the Iſraelites, in that their expedition againſt thoſe five kings that had joyned their forces together to beſiege Gibeon, as we may ſee chap. 10.36 37.38. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is ſaid here, that <hi>Joſhua cut off the Anakims from Hebron, from Debir,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be underſtood of his cutting them off from the mountains that were about Hebron and Debir. It ſeems that theſe gyants, being a kind of wild ſalvage men, monſters rather then men, did chiefly abide in dens and caves that were in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or at leaſt, that when Joſhua had prevailed in that part of the land, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſeverall towns and cities there, and deſtroyed the inhabitants, many of theſe monſters had withdrawn themſelves to thoſe their faſtneſſes and ſtrong holds, from whence afterwards they brake forth into the countreys adjoyning, and ſo thereupon Joſhua went out againſt them with his forces, and cut them off, ſome at one time and ſome at another, <hi>from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab,</hi> that is, the mountains adjoyning to thoſe cities, <hi>and from all the mountains of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and from all the mountains of Iſrael,</hi> that is, the mountains in that porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the land which fell to the tribe of Judah, and indeed from all the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains throughout the land of Canaan which fell to the reſt of the Iſraelites: for Judah, by reaſon of their dignity, is often mentioned as diſtinct from the other tribes; and in this regard I conceive this expreſſion is uſed, <hi>from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Iſrael,</hi> and not with reference to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the land betwixt the kingdome of Judah and the kingdome of Iſrael in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42229:30"/>
revolt, it being moſt probable that this book was written before that time, even before David had caſt out the Jebuſites out of Jeruſalem, as may be gathered from that place, chap. 15.63. <hi>As for the Jebuſites, the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebuſites dwell with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Judah at Jeruſalem unto this day.</hi> The greateſt difficulty in this place is this, that here it is ſaid, that <hi>Joſhua cut off the Anakims from Hebron, from Debir,</hi> &amp;c. cities that he had taken before from the inhabitants, chap. 10.36. &amp;c. and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, chap. 15.14. it is ſaid, that Caleb took Hebron and drove the Anakims thence. To this ſome anſwer, That though Joſhua took Hebron, and afterwards cut off the Anakims from the mountains about Hebron, as it is here ſaid; yet in proceſſe of time the inhabitants, and eſpecially theſe Anakims did again ſeiſe upon Hebron and poſſeſſe it, and ſo were after Joſhuas death driven out thence by Caleb: (for though this be related chap. 15.14. yet that it was not done till after the death of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, is evident (they ſay) in the firſt chapter of Judges, verſ. 9. where the ſame ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is again related.) But becauſe it is evident in the fourteenth chapter of this book verſ. 12. that Caleb whileſt Joſhua was yet living deſired Hebron and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous countrey about it to be given him for his inheritance, as Moſes had promiſed it ſhould be, undertaking withall, that with Gods help he would drive out the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kims thence, <hi>Give me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this mountain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If ſo be the Lord will be with me, then I ſhall be able to drive them out, as the Lord ſaid:</hi> nor is it probable that ever the Lord ſuffered the Canaanites to recover one foot of that land, out of which Joſhua had expelled them, till after the death of Joſhua, when by their ſinnes they provoked the Lord againſt them; nor that the valourous Caleb would ſuffer the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites to rooſt ſo long in that place which was given him for his inheritance, as till after the death of Joſhua: therefore I conceive, that the truer anſwer for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of this difficulty is this, That it was Caleb that did drive out the Anakims out of the mountains about Hebron, as is related chap. 15.14. onely it is here aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Joſhua, becauſe Joſhua was their chief Generall, and ſo it was done under his government and command, though it were done by Caleb. However the deſtroying the Anakims throughout the land of Canaan is here particularly recorded, that in Gods goodneſſe and power in cutting them now off, they might ſee the folly of their forefathers infidelity, who were ſo ſcared with the ſight and report of the formidable ſtature of theſe giants, that they would not enter the land notwithſtanding all that Moſes, Joſhua, and Caleb could ſay to them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; onely in Gaza, in Gath,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe were cities of the Philiſtims, whoſe land was alſo within the compaſſe of the promiſe made to the Iſraelites, Exod. 23.31. <hi>And I will ſet thy bounds from the red ſea, even unto the ſea of the Philiſtims,</hi> though becauſe of their ſinnes they prevailed not as yet ſo farre. In theſe cities there were of theſe Anakims, theſe giants ſtill remaining many years after: for Goliath was of Gath: ſee 1. Sam. 17.4. &amp;c. and thoſe foure huge giants mentioned 2. Sam. 21.16. &amp;c. were all of the Philiſtims.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And Joſhua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord ſaid unto Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he vanquiſhed the whole land before mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is ſaid to have taken the <hi>whole land,</hi> becauſe he had ſo far ſubdued it, that none of the inhabitants durſt take up arms againſt them, or any way moleſt them; ſo that they might now peaceably make a diviſion of it amongſt the tribes, though there were ſome places which the Canaanites had yet in their poſſeſſion, as is largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the beginning of the 13. chapter, yet they durſt not ſtirre againſt the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites; and therefore is that clauſe added in the laſt words of this chapter, <hi>and the land reſted from warre.</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>NOw Joſhua was old and ſtricken in years, and the Lord ſaid unto him, Thou art old,</hi> &amp;c.] God had promiſed that Joſhua ſhould divide this land unto the people, chap. 1.6. <hi>Be ſtrong, and of a good courage: For unto this people ſhalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I ſware unto their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to give them</hi> (and herein was he a type of Chriſt, who having vanquiſhed all

our enemies, is now aſcended up into heaven to prepare a place for us, John 14.2. <hi>In my fathers houſe are many manſions; if it were not ſo, I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you.</hi>) He therefore being now old, God calls upon him to diſpatch this work before he dyes, and not to deferre it till they were poſſeſſed of all, as happely he thought he muſt have done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>This is the land that ſtill remaineth: all the borders of the Philiſtines, and all Geſhuri.]</hi> The land of the Philiſtines lay along the coaſts of the midland ſea; and the land of Geſhuri was on the North part of Canaan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which is counted to the Canaanite,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, this land of the Philiſtines belongs to Canaan, &amp; conſequently to the Iſraelites, though as yet they have not taken it: For the Philiſtines (called Caphtorims becauſe thence they came, Amos 9.7. <hi>Have not I brought up Iſrael out of the land of Egypt? and the Philiſtines from Caphtor?</hi>) entered upon this part of Canaan, drove out the old inhabitants and dwelt in it themſelves, Deut. 2.23. <hi>The Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, deſtroyed them and dwelt in their ſtead.</hi> Concerning Sihor, ſee the note upon Num. 34.30.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>From the ſouth all the land of the Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as this land of the Philiſtines, which lies at the ſouth end of the ſea-coaſts, ſo alſo all the land of the Canaanites from thence along the ſea-coaſts, was not yet poſſeſſed by the Iſraelites, even <hi>Mearah</hi> (or the cave) <hi>that is beſides the Sidonians and Aphek,</hi> a town in the tribe of Aſher not farre from Sidon, and ſo to the borders of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites; for there were Amorites on both ſides of Jordan: There was a town in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed called Aphek whoſe king was ſlain by Joſhua, chap. 12.18. but this it ſeems was not that, but another in the tribe of Aſher called Aphik, Judges 1.31.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon toward the ſunne riſing,</hi> &amp;c.] The Giblites were a people who inhabited Gebel, Pſal. 83.7. a promontary near Sidon. All their countrey and all Lebanon, &amp;c. was not yet ſubdued. For now he turns to the midland ſea, to ſhew what lay unvanquiſhed on the northern bounds, to wit, the countrey about Libanus; and ſo eaſternly as farre as Hamath, where even in Davids time there was a Canaanitiſh king, 2. Sam. 8.9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Them will I drive out before the children of Iſrael.]</hi> This promiſe is to be underſtood conditionally, if they ſhould continue faithfull in keeping cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him; wherein failing they never came to poſſeſſe them, though in Davids and Solomons time they became tributary unto them.</p>

                     <hi>Onely divide thou it by lot unto the Iſraelites,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, even that land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of, not yet conquered; which God enjoyns to ſtrengthen their faith, and that having it in their charter from God, this might be a ſpurre to them in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times not to neglect the ſeeking of it, and driving out the reſt of the nations. See the note upon Num. 26.53.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>With whom the Reubenites, and the Gadites have received their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, with which tribe of Manaſſeh, (to wit, the other half of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42229:31"/>
them) the Reubenites and the Gadites had already received their inheritance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Jordan. For theſe words are added, to ſhew the reaſon why in the foregoing verſe, Joſhua was commanded to divide the land within Jordan, <hi>to the nine tribes and the half tribe of Manaſſeh,</hi> to wit, becauſe the Reubenites and the Gadites had already received their inheritance together with the other half of the Manaſſites in the land without Jordan, which Moſes had given them. And though there may ſeem to be a tautology, or a vain repetition of the ſame thing in the following words, <hi>which Moſes gave them, even as Moſes the ſervant of the Lord gave them,</hi> yet if the words be well weighed we ſhall find it is not ſo; for that ſecond clauſe, <hi>even as Moſes the ſervant of the Lord gave them,</hi> is added, as it were, to imply the juſt confirming of the former donation now by Joſhua, and the reſt that now divided the land; as if it had been ſaid, they have already received their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance which Moſes gave them beyond Jordan, as is fitting, becauſe Moſes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord did ſo order it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>From Aroer that is upon the bank of the river Arnon,</hi> &amp;c.] Here firſt the whole land without Jordan is deſcribed, which was by Moſes given to the Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites, and the Gadites, and the one half tribe of Manaſſeh; and then afterwards is ſhown what each of them had ſeverally.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Gilead, and the border of the Geſhurites and Maachathites.]</hi> Even the border of the Geſhurites and the Maachathites are here mentioned as a part of the land without Jordan, belonging to the two tribes and a half planted there, becauſe Moſes had indeed given them their countrey together with the reſt, though as yet they had it not in their poſſeſſion, as is afterwards expreſſed verſe 13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>For theſe did Moſes ſmite and caſt them out.]</hi> To wit, Sihon and Og before mentioned and their people. For this cannot be referred to all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the land before named, becauſe it is expreſſely ſaid in the following verſe, that the Geſhurites and the Maachathites were not caſt out.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Nevertheleſſe the children of Iſrael expelled not the Geſhurites,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the land without Jordan was vanquiſhed whileſt Moſes was yet living, yet they did not then drive out theſe Geſhurites &amp; Maachathites, who inhabited the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt skirts of the countrey, to wit, becauſe having in their poſſeſſion enough for the preſent uſe of the two tribes and a half that were planted there, it was not judged requiſite to delay their paſſing over Jordan till they had fully cleared all the utmoſt corners of that land. Neither was it therefore any ſinne in Moſes and the Iſraelites thus at firſt to forbear a while the caſting out of theſe people. But yet when in after times they continued ſtill to ſuffer them to rooſt amongſt them, that was an act of baſe ſloth, and is noted doubtleſſe in the laſt words of this verſe to their juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, <hi>the Geſhurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Iſraelites untill this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Onely unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance.]</hi> This, which is in ſo many places repeated, is here inſerted to ſhew the reaſon of that, verſe 7. why God enjoyned Joſhua to divide the land within Jordan <hi>unto the nine tribes and the half of Manaſſeh,</hi> to wit, becauſe the tribe of Levi was to have no part of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42229:32"/>
the land; for had they been to have had a ſhare too, there would have been ſtill ten tribes and a half to provide for.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Moſes gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance according to their families.]</hi> That is, proportionably according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their families. Now the bounds of each tribe are thus exactly ſet down to prevent all diſcord and diviſion for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And their coaſt was from Aroer,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, it reached from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roer excluſively. Aroer indeed belonged to the tribe of Gad, Num. 32.34. <hi>And the children of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer.</hi> So that the city of Aroer and the outſides of the plains of Medeba (for the plain it ſelf was a part of Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens poſſeſſion) are here made the bounds for this tribe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Heſhbon and all her cities that are in the plain of Dibon,</hi> &amp;c.] This town is reckoned amongſt Reubens poſſeſſions, Num. 32.37. <hi>And the children of Reuben built Heſhbon,</hi> yet Joſh. 21.39. and 1. Chron. 6.81. it is reckoned amongſt the cities of Gad given to the Levites. The next city Dibon is indeed reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the cities of Gad, Num. 32.34. <hi>And the children of Gad built Dibon,</hi> but the reaſon of this is, becauſe they ſtood in the confines of both tribes, and ſo were in common inhabited by both.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And all the kingdome of Sihon king of the Amorites which reigned in Heſhbon.]</hi> That is, and all the kingdome of Sihon in thoſe parts within the bounds before mentioned: for it is expreſſely ſaid, verſe 27. <hi>that the reſt of the kingdome of Sihon king of Heſhon</hi> was given to Gad. And this ſeems added, partly to imply that though ſome of theſe cities had been the Moabites, yet at that time they were Sihons, and ſo according to Gods commandment they meddled not with the Ammonites and Moabites countrey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whom Moſes ſmote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe five princes of Midian were not ſlain at the ſame time, and in the ſame battell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sihon was ſlain at Jahaz, Numb. 21.23, 24. but long after, by a party that were purpoſely ſent out by Moſes againſt the Medianites, Numb. 31.8. and therefore it is very probably conceived by Expoſitours, that the reaſon why the death of Sihon, &amp; theſe princes, is mentioned here together is, becauſe theſe princes, though they were princes of Midian, yet withall were (as it follows here in the next words) <hi>Dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the countrey,</hi> to wit, in the countrey of the Amorites, where Sihon reigned, and ſo aided him in his warre againſt the Iſraelites, and however they were not ſlain then together with Sihon, but eſcaped away into the land of Midian, and Sihon being now dead, took upon them the power and title of kings (for ſo they are therefore called, Numb. 31.8.) in ſome cities of Midian, that were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely before tributary to Sihon, yet afterward in another expedition of the Iſraelites, which they undertook by the direction of Moſes, againſt the Midianites, they were ſlain as Sihon their Lord was before in a former battell, and ſo the cutting off both of Sihon and theſe his vaſſals, is here mentioned together. Some Expoſitours do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed otherwiſe conceive of that laſt clauſe, <hi>Which were Dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the countrey,</hi> to wit, that though they were the vaſſals of Sihon, yet they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Midianites, and ſuch as dwelt in that countrey, and ſo were the more zealous

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>WHich Eleazar the Priest, and Joſhua the ſonne of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Iſrael diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted for inheritance unto them.]</hi> Who were choſen by the Lord, and expreſſed by name, Num. 34.17. See the note upon that place.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>By lot was their inheritance,</hi> &amp;c.] For the manner how this was done, ſee the note upon Num. 26.55. Onely the place where they ſhould have their portion was divided by lot, and afterward the quantitie of their ſeverall portions was laid out by Joſhua, Eleazar, and the heads of the tribes, according as the tribe was more or fewer in number; the firſt being done by caſting of lots to prevent all murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſcontents, and to make it the more evident that the propheſies both of Jacob and Moſes concerning the ſeverall inheritances of the tribes were from God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>For the children of Joſeph were two tribes,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added to ſhew how there were ſtill nine tribes and an half remaining (amongſt whom the land was to be divided) notwithſtanding the Levites were not reckoned amongſt them. See alſo the note, Gen 48.5.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Then the children of Judah came unto Joſhua in Gilgal; and Caleb,</hi> &amp;c.] It is evident by this place, that they began the diviſion of Canaan in Gilgal, though they finiſhed it afterwards in Shiloh, chap. 18.1, 6. and that becauſe the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was at preſent in Gilgal, and it was fit this work ſhould be done in the preſence of God, both that it might be done the more reverently and religiouſly, and that hereby they might be put in mind, that it was the Lord their God that would reach forth unto each tribe the lot which he had aſſigned for their portion. Now when they were met together about this great buſineſſe, it is ſaid here, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb (who is called <hi>the ſonne of Jephunneh, the Kenezite:</hi> becauſe he was deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Kenaz of the tribe of Judah, 1. Chron. 4.13, 15. and to diſtinguiſh him from another Caleb, who was the ſonne of Hezron, 1. Chron. 2.18.) came to Joſhua to demand that portion of the land by way of ſpeciall priviledge, which God had long ſince promiſed him; and becauſe many of his tribe, that is, of the chief men of his tribe went along with him, to wit, to countenance him, and to further him in his ſuit; both in regard that Caleb was a man of great eminency in their tribe, and alſo that the whole tribe were to be in ſome ſort gainers by this extraordinary portion conferred upon him, therefore it is ſaid in the firſt place, that <hi>the children of Judah came unto Joſhua;</hi> and then afterwards, that Caleb, attended thus with the chief el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Judah, propounded to Joſhua the buſineſſe about which they came.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou knoweſt the thing that the Lord ſaid unto Moſes the man of God, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me and thee, in Kadeſh-barnea.]</hi> It is much queſtioned by Expoſitours, what <hi>the thing</hi> is <hi>that the Lord ſaid unto Moſes</hi> concerning Caleb and Ioſhua, which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb here means. Some hold that ſo far as it concerns Caleb, it is meant of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular promiſe, which afterwards he doth plainly expreſſe, verſ. 9. to wit, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron and the land adjoyning ſhould be his inheritance: and for Ioſhua, they ſay it is meant of ſome ſuch like particular promiſe that was then alſo made to him, though it be not expreſſed in the ſtory, as happely, that he ſhould ſucceed Moſes in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42229:33"/>
of Iſrael, or that he ſhould chuſe what city or portion in the land he pleaſed, to be his peculiar inheritance: and this they judge the more probable, Firſt, becauſe it is not likely but that he dealing faithfully in the anſwer they returned concerning the land which they had ſearched, as well as Caleb, the Lord alſo rewarded him by ſome ſpeciall promiſe as well as Caleb: and, Secondly, becauſe it is expreſſely ſaid chap. 19.50. that <hi>according to the word of the Lord, they gave him the citie which he asked, even Timnath-ſerah in mount Ephraim.</hi> Again, others hold that <hi>the thing</hi> here meant <hi>that the Lord ſaid to Moſes,</hi> both concerning Caleb and Ioſhua, is that mentioned Num. 14.30. <hi>Doubtleſſe ye ſhall not come into the land concerning which I ſware to make you dwell therein, ſave Caleb the ſonne of Jephunneh, and Joſhua the ſonne of Nun.</hi> But all things conſidered, I conceive it moſt probable, that Caleb ſpake this indefinitely, of every thing which the Lord had ſpoken to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concerning Ioſhua and Caleb, to wit, that he doubted not but Ioſhua knew well what God had ſaid to Moſes in Kadeſh-barnea concerning them both, when they returned thither from ſearching the land; and ſo by affirming this in generall, he makes way to the propounding of that particular promiſe, verſ. 9. which God had made to him, that Hebron and the countrey adjoyning ſhould be his inheritance, concerning which it was neceſſary that he ſhould appeal to Joſhuas knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were none elſe now living that could be witneſſes of it, and in propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this introduction to that which he had further to ſay, he calls Moſes <hi>the man of God,</hi> that what God had promiſed by Moſes his ſpeciall ſervant might be the more regarded by them, <hi>Thou knoweſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the thing that the Lord ſaid unto Moſes the man of God concerning thee and me in Kadeſh-barnea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Fourtie yeares old was I when Moſes the ſervant of the Lord ſent me from Kadeſh-barnea.]</hi> See the note, chap. 11.18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.]</hi> That is, I told him truly what I thought of the land, and of our going to poſſeſſe it, nor did either for fear or favour of any man ſpeak one word otherwiſe then as in my conſcience I thought. I did not ſay as the other ſpies ſaid, to pleaſe them, nor did I on the other ſide encourage the people to enter upon the land, thereby to currie favour either with Moſes or the people, but I did it ſincerely, becauſe I did indeed verily believe, that God would certainly deliver it into our hands. Nor can this be counted any blemiſh to Caleb that he thus ſpeaks in his own commendation; That his brethren might not tax him either of injuſtice or ambition, for that which he was now about to require of Joſhua, it was fit he ſhould ſhew upon what juſt grounds it was at firſt promiſed him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>My brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the Lord my God.]</hi> To wit, by perſwading the people to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the land which the Lord had brought them to, even when the reſt of the ſpies did ſo exceedingly diſcourage them; which was a ſingular proof of the uprightneſſe of Calebs heart towards God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And Moſes ſware on that day, ſaying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have troden, ſhall be thine inheritance,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby it is evident, that there was a particular promiſe made unto Caleb at Kadeſh-Barnea, that Hebron and the land
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42229:34"/>
adjoyning ſhould be his, when the Iſraelites came to poſſeſſe Canaan, and that this place in the land was given him rather then any other, becauſe when the ſpies had ſeen thoſe giants, the Anakims, and were ſtricken with fear, when they ſaw them there, Numb. 13.22. <hi>And they aſcended by the ſouth, and came unto Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheſhai, and Talmai, the children of Anak were,</hi> and yet Caleb afterward oppoſed theſe his fainthearted brethren, and when they objected the invincible ſtrength of the place and people, he encouraged his people, and aſſured them that they ſhould eaſily vanquiſh them; either therefore thoſe places in Moſes his ſtory concerning Caleb muſt be underſtood of this particular gift, though at firſt reading they would not ſeem to import ſo much, Numb. 14.24. <hi>But my ſervant Caleb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had another ſpirit with him (and hath followed me fully) him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe it.</hi> And again, Deut. 1.36. <hi>Save Caleb the ſonne of Jephunneh, he ſhall ſee it, and to him will I give the land that he hath troden upon, and to his children, becauſe he hath wholly followed the Lord;</hi> or elſe, there was ſome particular promiſe made to him concerning this inheritance, together with that mentioned in thoſe places forenamed, though it be not expreſſed, and that confirmed with an oath, pronounced by Moſes in the name of the Lord. For ſo we reade it, Num. 14.21, 23, 24. <hi>But as truly as I live, all the earth ſhall be filled with the glory of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Surely they ſhall not ſee the land which I ſware unto their fathers, neither ſhall any of them that provoked me ſee it. But my ſervant Caleb, becauſe he had another ſpirit with him (and hath followed me fully) him will I bring into the land whereinto he went, and his ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And now behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he ſaid, theſe fourty and five years,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, God hath you ſee even miraculouſly preſerved my life and ſtrength, and ſo reſerved me as it were to enjoy this portion of land, which was then promiſed me.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>As my strength was then, even ſo is my ſtrength now, for warre, both to go out and come in.]</hi> See the note upon Numb. 27.17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that day.]</hi> That is, the mountainous countrey promiſed him by Moſes, wherein Hebron, Debir, and ſome other towns ſtood. See chap. 11.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For thou heardeſt in that day that the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced.]</hi> This he may ſpeak as intimating that ſeeing he himſelf would undertake the expelling of the giants that dwelt there, though the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable in all the land of Canaan, his deſire was the more reaſonable, becauſe he was to get with ſo much danger and difficulty the place that he deſired of them. But I rather conceive that this is added, to clear it that this was the place promiſed him, to wit, becauſe it was the place where the Anakims dwelt, whoſe huge bodies and great fenced cities were formerly ſo dreadfull to the other ſpies that went with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If ſo be the Lord will be with me, then I ſhall be able to drive them out, as the Lord ſaid.]</hi> This he ſaith, not as doubting Gods faithfulneſſe and aſſiſtance, but as thereby implying the difficulty of the work: but that he repoſed himſelf on the help and aſſiſtance of God, ſee the note chap. 11.24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Joſhua bleſſed him, and gave unto Caleb the ſonne of Jephunneh,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42229:34"/>
Hebron for an inheritance.]</hi> That is, he commended him, approved his motion, granted his requeſt, and deſired God to bleſſe it both to him and his. How this is ſaid to be Calebs inheritance that was afterwards given to the Levites, ſee chap. 21.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the land had reſt from warre.]</hi> We have this clauſe before, chap. 11.23. Here it is repeated again, 1. to intimate, That though the foregoing paſſage concerning Calebs deſiring Hebron be here inſerted, yet it was done before Joſhua had ended his warres, and that however all the victories of Joſhua be recorded in the tenth and eleventh chapters, becauſe he would joyn them altogether, yet many of theſe things hereafter expreſſed were done before the warres were ended: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To make way hereby to the relation of that which was further done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diviſion of the land, which was not till the land had reſt.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THis then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families, even to the border of Edom,</hi> &amp;c.] In this chapter the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dividing the land within Jordan by lot is continued, which was broken off in the foregoing chapter, to ſhew, how Caleb demanded that Hebron and the adjacent mountain might be reſerved to him, as his by an extraordinary promiſe which God had long ſince made to him. That the lots were onely to decide in what part of the countrey each tribe ſhould be planted, and that afterwards the quantitie of the land which each tribe ſhould have was ſet out by Joſhua, Eleazar, and the heads of the tribes, choſen to be the men that ſhould divide the land, is noted before upon the ſecond verſe of the foregoing chapter, as likewiſe, Num. 26.55. What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lottery they uſed in this buſineſſe is no where expreſſed. The common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Hebrew writers is, that there were two pots, or other veſſels, ſet before the Tabernacle, the one having the names of the tribes, that were to have their portion of the land aſſigned, the other juſt ſo many lots, in each of which ſuch and ſuch a part of the land was deſcribed, and that ſome man appointed to that ſervice, happely E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazar the high prieſt, drew out of one pot one of the tribes, and then out of the other pot one of the lots there, and ſo then that tribe had their portion aſſigned them in that part of the land deſcribed and ſet forth in that lot; and ſo accordingly with the reſt. And indeed though this be not expreſſed thus any where in the Scripture, yet the phraſe that is often uſed in the following chapters, that ſuch a lot came out &amp; ſuch a lot came up, may ſeem covertly to imply ſo much, as chap. 19. v. 1.10, 17, &amp;c. Some indeed hold that there was but one pot wherein there was ſo many lots as there were tribes that were to have their inheritance in the land within Jordan, each lot having a ſeverall portion of land deſcribed and ſet out therein, and that there was a lot drawn for each tribe in their ſeverall order, as firſt there was a lot drawn for the tribe of Judah, as is here ſaid, becauſe that tribe had the chief Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the firſt-born conferred upon them in ſtead of Reuben; and ſecondly there was lots drawn for the two tribes of Ephraim and Manaſſeh that were deſcended of Joſeph, chap. 16.1. and that becauſe they had alſo ſome part of the dignity of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42229:35"/>
Reubens primogeniture or birthright of the firſt-born conferred upon them; and ſo ſucceſſively in the reſt. But I ſee not how this can ſo well ſtand with the expreſſions which the Scripture uſeth concerning the lots: for thoſe phraſes which are uſed chap. 19. <hi>The ſecond lot came forth to Simeon,</hi> verſe 1. and <hi>the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>and the fourth lot came out to Iſſachar,</hi> verſe 17, &amp;c. do methinks very probably intimate, that it was not by appointment but by lot alſo, that ſuch a tribe had the firſt lot, and ſuch a tribe the ſecond, &amp;c. even as the lots wherein their names were written came firſt to hand; and ſurely herein the hand of God in ordering the lots was the more evident and wonderfull; as for inſtance, That Judahs lot ſhould come out firſt, and then that his lot ſhould fall in the richeſt and beſt part of the kingdome, how apparently were the people herein taught to take notice of the purpoſe of God in exalting this tribe above the reſt. As for the dividing of the land in ſeverall lots it may be queſtioned, whether there were not now at the firſt certain men ſent out to view the land, that they might the better know how to divide it into ſo many ſeverall lots, as they did afterward when after the work had been given over for a time they ſet upon it again, chap. 18.4, 5. <hi>Give out from among you three men for each tribe, and I will ſend them, and they ſhall riſe and go through the land, and deſcribe it according to the inheritance of them, and they ſhall come again to me, &amp; they ſhall divide it into ſeven parts,</hi> &amp;c. But becauſe this is ſo fully expreſſed there and no mention is made of any ſuch thing here, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may rather think that now at firſt they went not ſo exactly to work, but onely ſet out to each lot a portion of land as well as they could gueſſe according to that knowledge they had got of the land by ſeverall inrodes they had made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, till upon the three firſt lots that were drawn the people began to ſuſpect that Judahs lot being ſo large, there would not be a proportionable ſhare left for the other tribes, and ſo before they would ſet upon the work again, there were certain men ſent out purpoſely to make a more full diſcovery of the land, that they might the more equally ſet out to each lot a ſeverall ſhare. But however, here we have the lot of Judah (which by the ſingular providence of God came out firſt) deſcribed by the ſeverall bounds thereof, as it was in the firſt diviſion of the lots, <hi>This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families, even to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Edom;</hi> and the laſt clauſe, <hi>even to the border of Edom,</hi> is added to ſhew that the deſcription here given us of the bounds of Judahs portion ſhall begin at the eaſt end of the ſouth coaſt, which was towards the wilderneſſe of Edom: As for the ſouth coaſt which is here largely deſcribed in the foure firſt verſes of the chapter, what is to be noted therein you may ſee.

                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Othniel the ſonne of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb took it.]</hi> This was that Othniel which was afterwards the judge of Iſrael, Judg. 3.9. <hi>And when the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, the Lord rayſed up a deliverer to the children of Iſrael, who delivered them, even Othniel the ſonne of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother:</hi> and happely for this exploit he became firſt famous amongſt the Iſraelites, and we may well think that this ſtory is here inſerted chiefly for his ſake; by brother here may be meant kinſman, and ſo be referred to Othniel, that he was the brother, that is, the near kinſman of Caleb; but becauſe of that word <hi>(younger)</hi> added, Judg. 1.13. <hi>Othniel the ſonne of Kenaz Calebs younger brother:</hi> and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Judg. 3.9. I conceive this word brother is to be referred to Kenaz, that he was the father of Othniel, and the brother of Caleb: for though Caleb was the ſonne or grandchild of Kenaz, and thence called a Kenezite, chap. 14.16. yet he might have a Kenaz to his brother too.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And it came to paſſe, as ſhe came unto him, that ſhe moved him to ask of her father a field,</hi> &amp;c.] This following paſſage concerning the enlarging of Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſahs dowry, by a portion of land which her father gave her, may well be added, to ſhew how Caleb prized Othniel becauſe of this his taking Debir, <hi>It came to paſſe,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>as ſhe came unto him,</hi> that is, as ſhe was going from her fathers to her husbands family, <hi>ſhe moved him to ask of her father a field,</hi> that is, taking the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of her being now to leave her father (for then the affections of fathers are wont to be moved towards their daughters) ſhe perſwaded her husband to ask a field of her father, to wit, over and above that which he had already given her, as an encreaſe of her dowry: For Caleb had ſonnes, 1. Chron. 4.15. and in this caſe it is clear, they might not give away any part of their inheritance from their ſonnes to their daughters, Numb. 27.8, 9. <hi>If a man die and have no ſonne, then ye ſhall cauſe his inheritance to paſſe unto his daughter. And if he have no daughter, then ye ſhall give his inheritance unto his brethren:</hi> and therefore we muſt know that the land which Caleb had already given his daughter, and which ſhe further now deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him, was to be given her onely as a dowry for term of life, or till the yeare of Jubile. Being it ſeems not content with that portion of land, which her father had already given her, verſ. 19. ſhe moved her husband to ask, or (for ſo alſo the words may be underſtood) ſhe moved her husband that ſhe might ask another field, to wit, as an enlargement of her dowry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhe lighted off her aſſe: and Caleb ſaid unto her, What wouldest thou?]</hi> We may two ſeverall wayes underſtand this which is here ſaid concerning Achſah Calebs daughter, that <hi>ſhe lighted off her aſſe:</hi> for either the meaning may be, that when they had ſet her upon an aſſe, that ſhe might ride home with her husband Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel to his houſe, ſhe ſlipped down again, as in diſcontent and ſeeming to be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go with her husband, to wit, becauſe her husband had not as ſhe had moved him deſired of her father an enlargement of her dowry, and ſo thereupon her father
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42229:36"/>
demanded of her, <hi>what wouldeſt thou?</hi> as perceiving that ſhe was diſcontented, and deſirous to know what it was that troubled her: Or elſe, that having deſired her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as they were riding away from her fathers houſe, to make ſute to her father for another field to be added to what he had already given her, when ſhe perceived that he was loth to do it, or perſwaded her rather to undertake it her ſelf, ſhe lighted off her aſſe, as addreſſing her ſelf to make her requeſt to her father, which her father perceiving, demanded of her preſently what ſhe would have.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Who anſwered, Give me a bleſſing; for thou hast given me a ſouth land, give me alſo ſprings of water.]</hi> To intimate, that the portion of land which he had given her was dry and not well watered, ſhe calls it a <hi>ſouth land,</hi> to wit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the ſouthern parts of Iudahs portion were dry and barren, and hence ſuch lands were called ſouth lands; or elſe, becauſe the ſouthern parts of Calebs por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in particular were ſuch. And hereupon ſhe deſires him to give her alſo <hi>ſprings of water,</hi> thereby intending either merely ſome <hi>ſprings of water,</hi> which might be conveyed into the ſouth land to make it fruitfull, or elſe ſome portion of land that was well watered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he gave her the upper ſprings and the nether ſprings.]</hi> That is, ſome higher grounds that were well watered, and ſome lower; or which tends much to one, he gave her ſome ſprings or watered grounds on each ſide the land he had formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her for a dowry, both above it, and below it.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>All their cities are twenty nine, with their villages.]</hi> There are indeed eight and thirty cities or towns named in the foregoing verſes, and therefore for the clearing of this ſome hold, that becauſe nine of theſe were afterwards aſſigned to the tribe of Simeon, therefore it is ſaid here, that all the cities of Iudah in thoſe parts were nine and twenty. But the better anſwer I conceive is, that nine and twenty of them onely were walled cities, the other were the moſt famous towns and villages in thoſe parts. And here in this firſt catalogue of Iudahs cities in the Southern parts, the moſt noted towns are expreſſed by name, as well as the walled cities, that in the following catalogues we may conceive the ſame, to wit, that there were many towns of note beſides the cities there mentioned, though they be not expreſſed by name as here they are.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 63. <hi>As for the Jebuſites the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the children of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah could not drive them out.]</hi> It is a queſtion much argued amongſt writers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeruſalem ſtood in Judahs or in Benjamins portion. By many places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42229:37"/>
it ſeems evident that it was in Benjamins portion. For in the 18. chapter of this book verſ. 28. it is reckoned amongſt the cities that were in Benjamins lot, and we ſee that Moſes did before his death propheſie concerning Benjamin, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which was in Jeruſalem ſhould be built in Benjamins portion, for that is the drift of thoſe words, Deut. 33.12. <hi>And of Benjamin he ſaid, The beloved of the Lord ſhall dwell in ſafety by him, and the Lord ſhall cover him all the day long, and he ſhall dwell between his ſhoulders;</hi> yea and Jer. 6.1. the inhabitants of Jeruſalem are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely called the children of Benjamin, <hi>O ye children of Benjamin, gather your ſelves to flee out of the midst of Jeruſalem,</hi> and Judg. 1.21. the ſame that is here ſaid of the children of Judah is likewiſe there ſaid of the children of Benjamin, <hi>The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebuſites the inhabitants of Jeruſalem; but the Jebuſites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jeruſalem unto this day.</hi> But now again by other places of Scripture it ſeems as evident that Jeruſalem was in Judahs portion. For firſt, mention is here made of it as one of Judahs cities, <hi>The Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites dwell with the children of Judah at Jeruſalem unto this day:</hi> and ſecondly, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem is ſaid to have been taken by the children of Judah, Judg. 1.8. and thirdly, it is reckoned as the great priviledge of the children of Judah, that the Lord in his Temple dwelt amongſt them, Pſal. 78.67, 68, 69. <hi>Moreover he refuſed the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of Joſeph, and choſe not the tribe of Ephraim, but choſe the tribe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, the mount Sion which he loved, and he built his Sanctuary like high places,</hi> &amp;c. but the truth herein is, that Jeruſalem ſtood in the border of theſe two tribes, and ſo was part in Judahs, and part in Benjamins portion, and therefore the places of Scripture before cited do not any way contradict one another, the fort of Sion and ſome of the ſouth skirts of the city were in Judahs portion, but the greateſt part of the city in Benjamins, and therefore it may well be that when they went about to expell the Jebuſites that dwelt there, both Iudah and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin joyned their forces together, as Judah and Simeon did in a like caſe, Judg. 1.3. <hi>And Judah ſaid unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight aganst the Canaanites, and I likewiſe will go with thee into thy lot.</hi> As for that which is here ſaid concerning Jeruſalem, to wit, that the children of Judah could not drive out the Jebuſites thence (and the like we ſee is ſaid concerning the children of Benjamin, Judg. 1.21.) we muſt know that the Iebuſites continued in Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem unto Davids time. Indeed Adoni-zedek the king of Jeruſalem was ſlain by Ioſhua chap. 10.23, 26. (for he was one of thoſe five kings that made warre againſt Gibeon) though we find no mention there of his taking Ieruſalem; yea, and it is expreſſely ſaid, Iudg. 1.8. that afterwards the children of Iudah took the city of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem and burnt it with fire, that is, ſome part of it. Well, but yet the fort of Sion, which was the chief ſtrength of Ieruſalem, was not at that time taken by them; for that the Iebuſites held till David took it, 2. Sam. 5, 6, 7. yea and it ſeems that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Iebuſites did alſo by the help of this fort recover the city again, at leaſt ſo farre, that they forced the Iſraelites to let the Iebuſites dwell there amongſt them, as it is ſaid here. For in the dayes of the Iudges we ſee that Iebus, that is, Ieruſalem was ſtill inhabited by the Iebuſites, Iudg. 19.12. <hi>We will not turn aſide hither into the city of a ſtranger, that is not of the children of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith the Levite there
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42229:37"/>
concerning Iebus) <hi>we will paſſe over to Gibea.</hi> But however we muſt not think, that this which is ſaid here, that <hi>the children of Judah could not drive them out,</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by way of excuſing them; no, but rather to their ſhame and reproch; for though the fort of Sion was a place of great ſtrength, ſo that when David ſet himſelf down with his army before it, the Iebuſites ſcorned him, &amp; bragged that their lame and blind and impotent people, ſhould defend it againſt him, 2. Sam. 5.6. Yet God would certainly have driven them out according to his promiſe, had they not been wanting to themſelves. But they grew ſlothfull and faint hearted, and by theſe and other their ſinnes, provoked the Lord to withdraw himſelf from them, and ſo then indeed they could not drive out the inhabitants, but were glad to purchaſe peace upon any tearms; according to that Iudg. 2.20, 21. <hi>And the anger of the Lord was hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael, and he ſaid, Becauſe this people hath tranſgreſſed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkned to my voice; I alſo will not hence forth drive out any from before them, of the nations which Joſhua left when he died,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the lot of the children of Joſeph, fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the eaſt,</hi> &amp;c.] It is the opinion of ſome learned writers, that there was but one lot drawn for the children of Ioſeph, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one half of the tribe of Manaſſeh, being already diſpoſed of without Iordan, it was judged the fitteſt way to joyn the other half of the tribe of Maneſſeh in one lot with the tribe of Ephraim, under the common name of <hi>the children of Joſeph;</hi> for, ſay they, by this means they made ſure that the children of Ioſeph ſhould be ſeated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that part of Canaan, which the lot that was drawn out with that which had their name in it, did aſſigne to them. And this likewiſe, they ſeek to make good from the words of the text, both here where it ſpeaks of the inheritance of Ephraim &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh, as comprehended in one lot, <hi>And the lot of the children of Joſeph, fell from Jordan,</hi> &amp;c. and again, chap. 17.14. where the children of Ioſeph ſeem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of this, <hi>And the children of Joſeph spake unto Joſhua ſaying, why haſt thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit?</hi> But all things conſidered, I think it more probable that there were two ſeverall lots for the tribe of Ephraim and the half of Manaſſeh: firſt, becauſe thoſe words chap. 14.2. <hi>By lot was their inheritance —for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe,</hi> ſeems rather to imply, that there were ſeverall lots both for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe: ſecondly, becauſe the portion that fell to the tribe of Ephraim being deſcribed in the latter part of this chapter, it follows in the beginning of the next chapter, <hi>There was alſo a lot for the tribe of Manaſſeh:</hi> for do not thoſe words clearly intimate that there was one lot drawn for Ephraim, and another for Manaſſeh? and thirdly, becauſe the providence of God in ordering the lots muſt needs be the more wonderfull, if Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahs lot coming forth firſt, the next two lots alſo that were drawn ſhould be theſe of Ephraim and Manaſſeh, the ſonnes of Ioſeph, immediately one after another, upon whom alſo God had transferred a part of Reubens birthright, as it is expreſſely ſaid,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42229:38"/>
1. Chron. 5.1, 2. And indeed that complaint of the ſonnes of Joſeph, chap. 17.14. <hi>Why haſt thou given we but one lot and one portion to inherit?</hi> was not meant of the drawing but one lot for them, but of the quantitie of land aſſigned to them for their portion, to wit, that it was no more then might well have been aſſigned for one tribe. For had they taken exception that there was but one lot for theſe two tribes, they would have conteſted about this when they made the lots, and not after their lot was drawn. And here in this place, the text ſpeaks of <hi>the lot of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Joſeph</hi> in the ſingular number, not becauſe there was but one lot drawn both for Ephraim and Manaſſeh, but becauſe the writer of this book intended, firſt to ſhew joyntly together where the inheritance of theſe two tribes lay, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſhew ſeverally what each of them had for their portion. So that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe firſt three verſes of this chapter the ſouth bounds of the inheritance of the ſonnes of Joſeph where it bordered upon Benjamins portion is deſcribed, to wit, that they began at that part of Jordan which was nigh unto Iericho, and ſo went up <hi>unto the water of Jericho,</hi> that is, to certain ſtreams that watered Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, called afterwards the waters of Eliſha, becauſe of that miracle which he wrought upon them, 2. Kings 2.21. (it is here ſaid to have been <hi>on the eaſt,</hi> and chap. 18.12. <hi>on the north ſide of Jericho,</hi> becauſe it lay north-eaſt of the city) and ſo to the wilderneſſe that goeth up from Iericho throughout mount Bethel, namely the wilderneſſe of Beth-aven chap. 18.12. and ſo from Bethel to Luz, and thence <hi>to the borders of Archi, to Ataroth</hi> called alſo Ataroth-addar verſe 5. and again, chap. 18 12. and ſo on ſtill weſtward by the ſeverall places here mentioned till they ended at laſt <hi>at the ſea,</hi> that is, the Mediterranean ſea.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 5. <hi>The border of their inheritance on the eaſt ſide was Ataroth-addar unto Beth-horon the upper.]</hi> Here begins the deſcription of that portion of the land of Canaan which was aſſigned to the tribe of Ephraim; which to us that cannot have any certain knowledge of that countrey as it was in thoſe times, muſt needs be very difficult and hard to be underſtood, eſpecially being deſcribed here in ſo few words as it is. In this firſt clauſe all is ſaid, that is ſaid, concerning the eaſtern bounds, to wit, that it reached from Ataroth in the ſouthern bounds, to Beth-horon in the north ſide; and ſo indeed the breadth of Ephraims portion is onely here ſet forth where it was broadeſt eaſtward.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the border went out toward the ſea to Michmethah,</hi> &amp;c.] There being mention made in the former verſe of Beth-horon the upper, which lay on the north ſide of Ephraims lot, here now the text deſcribes how the north border went out from the ſaid Beth-horon firſt weſtward to Michmethah, and then eaſtward by ſeverall towns here mentioned, till it ended at laſt at Jordan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>The border went out from Tappuah weſtward,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the text returns to ſhew what had been touched before, verſe 6. to wit, how the northern border went on weſtward beyond Michmethah toward the ſea, namely, that it went along by Tappuah unto the river Kanah, and ſo at laſt to the midland ſea.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 9. <hi>And the ſeparate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manaſſeh.]</hi> That is, beſides the cities that ſtood within the compaſſe of theſe bounds, the Ephramites had certain cities allotted them

within the portion of Manaſſeh, as an addition, becauſe this portion here deſcribed was too little for them.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THere was alſo a lot for the tribe of Manaſſeh, (for he was the firſt-born of Joſeph)</hi> to wit, <hi>for Machir the firſt born of Manaſſeh,</hi> &amp;c.] This clauſe, <hi>for he was the first born of Joſeph,</hi> is added, to imply that though Jacob had propheſied that Ephraims dignitie ſhould be the greater, Gen. 49.19. <hi>His younger brother ſhall be greater then he, and his ſeed ſhall become a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of nations,</hi> yet Manaſſeh being one of Joſephs ſonnes, yea his firſt born, he was alſo to have the portion of a tribe as well as Ephraim, according as Jacob had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of them, Gen. 48.5, 6. <hi>And now thy two ſonnes Ephraim and Manaſſeh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine: As Reuben and Simeon, they ſhall be mine. And thy iſſue which thou begetteſt after them ſhall be thine.</hi> Now the lot that fell to Manaſſeh is ſaid to have been for Machir the firſt born of Manaſſeh, becauſe Manaſſeh had no other ſonnes but Machir onely, and therefore ſometimes Machir ſeems to be put for the whole tribe of Manaſſeh, Judges 5.14. <hi>Out of Machir came down gov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe he was a man of war therefore he had Gilead and Baſhan.]</hi> That is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Machir the father of Gilead was a man of warre Many conceive that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir had no other ſonnes but Gilead, and that all Manaſſehs portion was divided amongſt Gileads poſteritie. But this we may well doubt, 1. Becauſe Gen. 50.23. there is mention made of Machirs children. 2. Becauſe Num. 26.29. we reade of a family of the Machirites diſtinct from thoſe that were called by the names of the ſonnes of Gilead; concerning which, ſee the note on the place. However, the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Machir had the land of Gilead and Baſhan, that is, the half of it, ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them (which is here mentioned by the way, that after he might proceed to ſpeak of their dividing to the other half of this tribe, their portion of the land within Jordan) and that becauſe Machir was a man of warre, that is, becauſe the Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites were men of warre, and did themſelves win Gilead and diſpoſſeſſe the enemie of it. See the notes, Numb. 32.39, 40.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Therefore according to the commandment of the Lord, he gave them an inheritance,</hi> &amp;c.] See Numb. 27.7.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And there fell ten portions to Manaſſeh.]</hi> That is, the land was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſix parts according to the number of the ſonnes of Gilead mentioned verſe 2. and Hephers part was divided into five parts, and given to his ſonne Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophehads five daughters; and ſo there were ten portions in all.</p>

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42229:39"/>Verſ. 7. <hi>And the coaſt of Manaſſeh was from Aſher to Michmethah,</hi> &amp;c.] If Aſher was a town ſeated at the ſouth-eaſt end of Manaſſehs lot (as ſome conceive it was) then in this and the following verſes, we have onely the deſcription of the ſouthern bounds of this tribe of Manaſſeh, which were alſo the north bounds of Ephraims portion, as is evident becauſe Michmethah and the other following places here mentioned, as Tappuah and the river Kanah, are the ſame that were named before in the north border of Ephraim; But if Aſher ſtood, as others think, in the north-eaſt of Manaſſehs portion, then in the firſt words we have the eaſt bounds of this half tribe of Manaſſeh, to wit, that they were drawn from Aſher on the north all along by the river Jordan to Michmethah on the ſouth that lyeth before Shechem, and then in the next words, we have the ſouthern bounds deſcribed from Michmethah to the midland ſea, to wit, that from Michmethah it went a long on the right hand turning weſtward to Tappuah, and ſo on the ſouth of the river Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, verſe 9. and ſo right on to the ſea: and thus, as is noted in that ninth verſe, the land was Manaſſehs both on the north and ſouth ſide of the river Kanah, though the cities that ſtood on the ſouth ſide of that river belonged to Ephraim, which is intended in thoſe words, <hi>theſe cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manaſſeh,</hi> that is, the cities on the ſouth ſide of the river belonged to Ephraim, though they were within the coaſts of Manaſſeh.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And they met together in Aſher on the north, and on Iſſachar on the east.]</hi> That is, the north bounds of Joſephs portion, to wit, Ephraims and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſehs conſidered joyntly in one, was the tribe of Aſher on the north, and Iſſachar on the eaſt. For otherwiſe then thus it cannot be conceived how they ſhould meet together in Aſher on the north, ſince Ephraim no where could reach to Aſher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bounded as Manaſſeh alſo was on the weſt by the main ſea.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Yet the children of Manaſſeh could not drive out the inhabitants of thoſe cities,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken of the times after the death of Joſhua, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame is repeated, Judg. 1.27, 28. Partly through cowardlineſſe, and partly through Gods withdrawing his help, at firſt they could not drive them out; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when their fear could not ſo much blind their judgements, but that they muſt needs then acknowledge themſelves ſtrong enough, yet they put them to tribute; which did much aggravate their ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the children of Joſeph ſpake unto Joſhua, ſaying, Why haſt thou given me but one lot,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the ſtory relates how the ſonnes of Joſeph, that is, the two tribes of Ephraim and Manaſſeh, came to Joſhua, and made a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint (and it was doubtleſſe after they had entred upon the land which fell to them
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42229:39"/>
by lot) that there was not a convenient portion of land aſſigned to them for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, no more indeed then was fitting to be the lot of one tribe: for that is the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>Why haſt thou given me but one lot, and one portion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit,</hi> that is, why haſt thou given us no more of the land, then if we had been to be accounted but as one tribe, and ſo to have but one lot? Queſtionleſſe, Joſhua and the reſt that were intruſted in this buſineſſe had not, either through ignorance or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, ſet forth a leſſe portion of land for theſe ſonnes of Joſeph then was fitting: But becauſe a part of the land allotted them was over-grown with wood, and a great part of it was ſtill in the poſſeſſion of the Perizzites, and the Rephaims or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, with whom through infidelity and ſloth they affraid to encounter; therefore they judging this as nothing, conclude they had no more given them to dwell in, then might well be reckoned the portion of one tribe. The moſt queſtionable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in this complaint of theirs is this, that to make good that they had not a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent portion of land aſſigned them, they alledge the extraordinary encreaſe of their people in number, through the ſpeciall bleſſing of God upon them, <hi>Why haſt thou given me but one lot, and one portion to inherit, ſeeing I am a great people, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Lord hath bleſſed me hitherto,</hi> ſince it is evident, as is noted Num. 26.37. that the ſonnes of Ephraim, when they were numbred the ſecond time, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their entrance into Canaan were eight thouſand fewer then when they were numbred the firſt time at their firſt coming out of Egypt; but for this we muſt know, that though the tribe of Ephraim was ſo much decreaſed at that laſt numbring of the people, yet ſince that time, under the government of Joſhua, they might be greatly encreaſed again; but however, though at that time the ſonnes of Ephraim were eight thouſand fewer then when they came out of Egypt, yet even at that time on the other ſide, of the tribe of Manaſſeh there were twenty thouſand and five hundred more then at the firſt numbring, Num. 26.34. and therefore the ſonnes of Joſeph ſpeaking here of themſelves joyntly together, both Ephraim and Manaſſeh, they might well ſay they were a great people, and that God had greatly bleſſed them, in regard of their number.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Joſhua anſwered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood countrey,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus he covertly retorts their plea upon them, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more for him then for them; for, ſayes he, being a great people, the more able art thou to drive the Canaanites out of thoſe parts allotted you for your proportion, and the more ſhame is it that you ſhould let them alone and yet complain of the narrowneſſe of your lot; <hi>Get thee up</hi> (ſaith Joſhua) <hi>to the wood countrey, and cut down for thyſelf there in the land of the Perizzites, and the giants,</hi> that is, cut down the woods, and drive out and deſtroy the inhabitants that lurk there in their faſtneſſes, and ſtrong holds, and then <hi>if mount Ephraim be to narrow for thee,</hi> that is, the mountains out of which the Canaanites are already expelled, whereof you have the poſſeſſion at preſent, you may by this means have land enough to dwell in, and need not complain that your portion is too ſtreight for you. It is likely, that when the ſonnes of Joſeph came to make their complaint to Joſhua, they aſſured themſelves that they ſhould find the more favour, becauſe he was of the tribe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim: But in a point of juſtice, we ſee they found Joſhua farre from yielding to them in the leaſt degree upon that ground.</p>

Joſhua had told them what they ſhould do, <hi>if mount Ephraim were too narrow for them:</hi> now as men diſcontented are wont to do, they ſnap at thoſe laſt words of Joſhua; yes, ſay they, <hi>the hill is not enough for us,</hi> meaning that mount Ephraim whereof Ioſhua had ſpoken; and then they adde, <hi>And all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron:</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you call upon us to enlarge our dwellings in the wood countrey, by cutting down the wood, by expelling and deſtroying the Perizzites and the giants that dwell there, you may know that this we cannot do, and that becauſe the valleys we muſt paſſe through ere we can come to that mountainous wood countrey, which you referre us to, are inhabited by the Canaanites that have chariots of iron, ſo that there is no hope for us to prevail over them. This I conceive to be the beſt expoſition of this place. Yet ſome underſtand thoſe firſt words, <hi>The hill is not enough for us,</hi> of that mountainous wood countrey, to which Ioſhua had referred them for the enlarging of their dwellings, and ſo conceive the ſcope of this reply of the ſonnes of Ioſeph to be, that even that mountainous countrey, if they had it in their poſſeſſion, would not be enough for them; and for the valleys, there was no hope to ſubdue them, becauſe the Canaanites that dwelt there had chariots of iron; that is, as all Expoſitours agree, chariots whoſe wheels were armed with ſythes, as I may ſay, or hooks of iron, wherewith when they broke in amongſt their enemies, they muſt needs mightily tear, cut, and mow down thoſe that ſtood in their way; and indeed theſe chariots could onely be uſefull in the valleys and plains, in the mountains and wood countreys they could not be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Joſhua ſpake unto the houſe of Joſeph, even to Ephraim, and to Manaſſeh, ſaying, Thou art a great people,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, What I anſwered before I muſt anſwer again, <hi>Thou art a great people</hi> by thine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>and hast great power,</hi> and therefore beſides Gods promiſe, ye have otherwiſe no cauſe of diſtruſt, <hi>thou ſhalt not have one lot onely,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt, if thou wilt not be failing to thy ſelf, prevail over thoſe places, and then thou ſhalt find the portion allotted thee is more then one lot, fully enough for two ſuch numerous tribes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>But the mountain ſhall be thine, for it is a wood; and thou ſhalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it ſhall be thine,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, not onely <hi>the mountain ſhall be thine,</hi> which when thou haſt cut down the wood, will be found good ground, but alſo <hi>the outgoings of it,</hi> that is, the valleys round about the mountains <hi>ſhall be thine too.</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42229:40"/>
ſhall chuſe out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation ſhall ye ſeek, and thither thou ſhalt come:</hi> as alſo Ier. 7.12. where it is plainly called <hi>the place where God ſet his Name at the firſt.</hi> Hitherto both camp and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had been in Gilgal, a place in the very firſt entrance into the land of Canaan; now they removed further into the land, both the camp, verſ. 9. <hi>And the men went and paſſed through the land, and deſcribed it by cities into ſeven parts in a book, and came again to Joſhua to the hoſt at Shiloh;</hi> and the tabernacle, as is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, both as a manifeſt ſigne of their taking poſſeſſion of the land they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and for the more convenient coming of the people to the tabernacle to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And Shiloh God appointed to be the place, a city in Ephraim, therein God honouring Ioſhua the ruler of the people, who was of this tribe; and withall, it was brought nearer to the place which God had decreed to be the ſettled place of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to wit, Ieruſalem: from this time therefore the people was bound to the ſtrict obſervation of the Ceremoniall Law, Deut. 12.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man what is right in his own eyes. For ye are not as yet come to the rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you. But when ye come over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit; and when he giveth you reſt from all your enemies round about, ſo that you dwell in ſafety: Then there ſhall be a place which the Lord your God ſhall chuſe, to cauſe his name to dwell there, thither ſhall ye bring all that I command you, your burnt offerings and your ſacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hands, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and here the Tabernacle continued unto the dayes of Samuel, to wit, above three hundred years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the land was ſubdued before them.]</hi> That is, the land about Shiloh was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and the inhabitants driven out of it, and thoſe that dwelt further off were ſo ſtricken with the terrour of God, that they durſt not ſtirre to moleſt the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And there remained among the children of Iſrael ſeven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.]</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange that the Iſraelites ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun in Gilgal to divide the land by lot, went not on in that work, but having drawn three lots, which fell to Judah, Ephraim, and Manaſſeh, gave over and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this work, and that as it ſeems a long time; for ſo much is evident by Joſhua his expoſtulation with them, verſ. 3. (though it be not expreſſely ſaid how long it was) <hi>How long,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are you ſlack to go to poſſeſſe the land,</hi> &amp;c. why they did this no reaſon is given in the text: But this by Expoſitours is thought the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon, to wit, that the other tribes perceiving what a large circuit of land was given to Judah (out of which indeed more then the portion of one tribe was afterward taken, ſee chap. 19.9.) they began to murmure, as ſuppoſing that there would not be left an equall ſhare for them; and the rather, becauſe they heard the ſonnes of Joſeph already complain, and therefore pretending that there could not be any equall diviſion made, when the remote parts were no better known to them, as being yet in the enemies poſſeſſion, they deſired ſome ſtay of the work till they had further prevailed, and might know the land they were to divide, better then yet they could do. And thus the work being put off for a time, by degrees they began to mind
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42229:41"/>
it no more, till Joſhua finding them ſhamefully remiſſe, urged them to ſet upon it again, and for their better ſatisfaction to ſend forth men to ſearch the land.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Give out from among you three men of each tribe,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, not onely of the ſeven tribes mentioned verſ. 2. but alſo of Judah, Ephraim, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh; leſt if theſe ſearchers ſhould conceive that it was fit ſomewhat ſhould be taken from thoſe that had their lots already, they might otherwiſe complain of partialitie in thoſe that were ſent to ſearch the land. As for the work that theſe men were to do, namely to deſcribe the land according to the inheritance of them, it is meant doubtleſſe of ſome catalogue they were to bring of the ſeverall countreys and parts of the land that were not yet divided, with the ſeverall cities, and towns, and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that were in each of them, that ſo accordingly they might the better divide it into ſo many parts.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Judah ſhall abide on their coaſts on the ſouth,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is onely that the tribe of Judah, and the ſonnes of Ioſeph, Ephraim and Manaſſeh, ſhould continue ſeated, the one on the South, the other on the North, in that part of the land wherein the lots that were drawn for them in Gilgal fell, and not that they ſhould have ſtill the ſame quantity of land that was at firſt aſſigned them: for we ſee afterward, that the tribe of Simeon had their portion aſſigned them out of that which was at firſt in the lot of Iudah, chap. 19.9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Ye ſhall therefore deſcribe the land into ſeven parts and bring the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hither to me, that I may caſt lots here for you before the Lord our God.]</hi> This ſome ſay was ſpoken to the men that were choſen to deſcribe the land. But I conceive it might as well be ſpoken to the whole aſſembly, to whom hitherto Ioſhua had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his ſpeech, <hi>Ye ſhall therefore deſcribe the land into ſeven parts, and bring the deſcription,</hi> &amp;c. that is, ye ſhall take order that by the men you ſend out, the land be deſcribed into ſeven parts, and then that the deſcription thereof be brought to me. However, the mention he makes in the laſt words of the account they were to give of what they had done, before the Lord in the tabernacle, was doubtleſſe to intimate how carefull the men that were ſent had need to be, diligently and carefully to carry themſelves in this great charge that was impoſed upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And the men went and paſſed through the land, and deſcribed it by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into ſeven parts,</hi> &amp;c.] They might uſe ſome likely means to prevent danger, when they ſearched the countreys of their enraged enemies; perhaps they divided themſelves, and went not all together; they might alſo go under pretence of negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and it may be diſguiſed, that they might not ſeem Iſralites. But doubtleſſe the aſtoniſhment and fear wherewith God had ſtricken the inhabitants, upon the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites late victories, were the beſt means of their ſafety: and by their preſervation in this dangerous ſervice, we may well think their brethren were much encouraged to ſet upon the getting of the remainder of the land into their poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus had Benjamin the honour of having the firſt lot amongſt the ſeven tribes, and was by Gods providence ſeated the very next to his brethren Ephraim and Manaſſeh, (who likewiſe were of Rachel) and had alſo the royall city of Ieruſalem within his borders, where God dwelt in his holy Temple; wherein that was accompliſhed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42229:41"/>
which Moſes propheſied of this tribe, Deut. 33.12. <hi>And of Benjamin he ſaid, The beloved of the Lord ſhall dwell in ſafety by him, and the Lord ſhall cover him all the day long, and he ſhall dwell between his ſhoulders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And their border on the North was from Jordan,</hi> &amp;c.] This North border of Benjamin is the ſame with the South border of the ſonnes of Ioſeph, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed before, chap. 16.1. concerning which therefore ſee the notes there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the border was drawn thence, and compaſſed the corner of the ſea ſouthward</hi> &amp;c.] Here begins the Weſtern border of Benjamins portion; for here the line turns from North to South, and fetching a compaſſe about an inlet or creek of the ſea goeth on ſouthward till it comes to Kirjath-baal in Iudahs portion, called by the Iſraelites (to ſuppreſſe the name of their idol-god) Kirjath-jearim.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the ſouth quarter was from the end of Kirjath-jearim,</hi> &amp;c.] See chap. 15.5, 6. where you ſhall find the ſame to be made the north border of Judah; onely that line is drawn from eaſt to weſt, from the lake of Sodome to Kirjath-jearim, this from the weſt to the eaſt from Kirjath-jearim to the lake of Sodome: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, ſee the note there.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families, were Jericho,</hi> &amp;c.] It is no wonder though in ſeverall places of Scripture, we find mention made of ſome cities belonging to the tribe of Benjamin that are not in this Catalogue; For many cities might be built in after times. And beſides, it is probable that all the cities in Benjamins lot are not here mentioned, but ſuch onely as were requiſite to be known, becauſe by them the bounds of their lot are deſcribed, or for the better underſtanding of ſome other paſſages in the ſacred hiſtory where theſe cities are mentioned. And the like we muſt conceive of the catalogues that are given us in the following chapter of the cities that were in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall lots of the other tribes.</p>

Judah, and ſo ſhould make one of the lots for the ſeven tribes (beſides ſome other cities which they took alſo from Judah to be as part of another lot, as is ſhown after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, verſe 40.41.) and no doubt the children of Judah acknowledged the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof, and were well contented with it: and ſo when they came to draw the lots of the ſeven remaining tribes, in the ſecond place, next after Benjamins, came out this lot, which was wholly taken out of Judahs portion, for the tribe of Simeon. And thus by the providence of God; firſt, there being one tribe to be ſeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that portion formerly given to Judah, the lot fell upon this tribe, which was feweſt in number of all the tribes, as we may ſee by the account that was taken of them at the laſt numbring of the people, Num. 26.14. and ſecondly, this tribe of Simeon having their portion aſſigned them within the portion of Iudah, and ſo being as it were intermingled with them, nor having an inheritance apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that was now fulfilled which Jacob long ſince propheſied of them, Gen. 49.7. <hi>I will divide them in Jacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael:</hi> concerning which, ſee what is noted there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And they had in their inheritance Beer-ſheba,</hi> &amp;c.] The bounds of this tribes portion is not deſcribed, as are the bounds of moſt of the other tribes, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the chief cities and towns are named that were in their lot, and that becauſe their inheritance was within the inheritance of Judah, whoſe bounds are formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed chap. 15.

                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And from thence paſſeth on along on the eaſt to Gittah-Hepher,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, from Japhia a city in the ſouth-eaſt corner of Zebuluns portion, the border turns northward along by the ſea of Galilee, and within a while goeth up into the land as farre as Remmon and Neah, where is the going out of the utmoſt reach of the eaſtern border.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the border compaſſeth it on the north ſide to Hannathon,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the north border which fetcheth a compaſſe, and ſo ends in the valley of Jiphthah-el.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Idalah and Bethlehem.]</hi> This was not that Bethlehem where Chriſt was afterward born; for that was in the tribe of Judah, this in the tribe of Zebulun.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twelve cities with their villages.]</hi> There are more then twelve mentioned in the foregoing verſes; but it ſeems ſome of them were border towns that ſtood in the other tribes, that had their lots next to Zebuluns, and but twelve of them onely were belonging to the tribe of Zebulun.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And their border was toward Jezreel,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe Iſſachars portion lay between Benjamins and Zebuluns, whoſe borders have been already deſcribed (and ſo conſequently Iſſachars alſo) therefore the line of their borders is not here deſcribed as in the other tribes, but onely the principal towns and cities are named, firſt, thoſe that ſtood in the ſouth border, verſ. 18, 19. ſecondly, thoſe in the weſt, verſ. 20. and thirdly, thoſe in the north, ver. 21, 22. Now this portion ſet apart for Iſſachar being in a fat and fruitfull ſoil, that was fulfilled which Jacob foretold, Gen. 49.14. <hi>And he ſaw that reſt was good, and the land that it was pleaſant, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſhoulders to bear, and became a ſervant unto tribute:</hi> and Moſes, Deut. 32.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Aſher,</hi> &amp;c. Even here alſo the hand of God is ſtill obſervable in his ordering the lots. Hitherto the lots had come out onely for thoſe tribes that were deſcended of Jacobs two wives Leah and Rachel, and the tribe of Gad, who was the eldeſt of Jacobs ſonnes by Zil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah Leahs handmaid, had already received their inheritance without Jordan, upon ſpeciall ſuit made unto Moſes, &amp; ſo now the next lot came out for the tribe of Aſher, who was alſo the ſonne of Zilpah, the handmaid of Leah Jacobs firſt wife, and therefore preferred before the two tribes of Dan and Naphtali, that were deſcended of Bilhah the handmaid of Rachel, his ſecond wife.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And their border was Helkath,</hi> &amp;c.] The cities that are firſt here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſtood on the northweſt border, which is drawn all along the coaſt of the midland ſea, as far as to mount <hi>Carmel weſtward,</hi> that is, to the weſt ſide of mount Carmel and Shihor-libnah; and ſo here the line turneth eaſtward, verſ. 27. and makes the ſouth bounds of this tribes portion, and then fetcheth a compaſſe northward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, like to the bending of a bow, till it comes to Zidon on the north end of the ſea coaſt, &amp; then turneth ſouthward again as far as Tyre, &amp;c. Now by the mention that is

here made of mount Carmel in the lot of this tribe, we may ſee how the propheſie of Jacob concerning this tribe was folly accompliſhed, Gen. 49.20. <hi>Out of Aſher his bread ſhall be fat, and he ſhall yield royall dainties:</hi> for mount Carmel and the land about it was a fruitfull ſoil, and had many mines in it, Iſa. 39.9. <hi>Sharon is like a wilderneſſe, and Baſhan and Carmel ſhake off their fruits:</hi> and Iſa. 35.2. <hi>It ſhall bloſſome abundantly, and rejoyce even with joy and ſinging; the glory of Lebanon ſhall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon.</hi> See alſo, Deut. 33.24, 25. <hi>And of Aſher he ſaid, Let Aſher be bleſſed with children, let him be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oyl.

So that in all the cities here named belonging to the tribe of Aſher are twenty and two. Indeed he that reckons all the names of places before mentioned ſhall find them to be twenty and three; but to this it is anſwered by ſome, that Cabul mentioned verſ. 27. was not a city, but a part of the countrey which Solomon gave unto Hiram, and becauſe of the cenſure which was then by him paſſed upon it, was called Cabul, 1. Kings 9.13. <hi>And he ſaid, What cities are theſe which thou hast given me my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</hi> And again others ſay, that ſome one of the bordering cities before named belonged not to Aſher, but to ſome of the neighbouring tribes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And their coast was from Heleph,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the eaſt border of the tribe of Naphtali, beginning at theſe towns which ſtood ſomewhat more northerly then the fountains of Jordan; and ſo Iordan, even as farre as the lake of Geneze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, was the utmoſt ſouthernly end of the eaſtern border. Thus Naphtalies land lay along by the banks of Iordan in a large extent, and ſo Iacobs propheſie was fulfilled, Gen. 49.21. <hi>Naphtali is a hind let looſe:</hi> and that of Moſes, Deut. 33.23. <hi>And of Naphtali he ſaid, O Naphtali ſatisfied with favour, and full with the bleſſings of the Lord, poſſeſſe thou the weſt and the ſouth.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>Then the coaſt turneth weſtward to Aznoth-tabor</hi> &amp;c.] Here now the ſouth border of this tribes portion is deſcribed, to wit, that it turned from Iordan weſtward; firſt to Aznoth-tabor, and thence to Hukkok and ſo went on till it came to have, as it follows in the next words. <hi>Zebulun on the ſouth ſide, and Aſher on the weſt ſide.</hi> And indeed, this laſt clauſe ſeems to have reference to that propheſie of Moſes, before mentioned, concerning this tribe, Deut. 33.23. <hi>Poſſeſſe thou the west and the ſouth:</hi> for however it is noted before upon that place (as the opinion of ſome Expoſitours) that thereby might be ſignified, that the lot of their inheritance ſhould be in the ſouthweſt part of the land, yet it being ſo evident here that this tribe had their inheritance in the utmoſt northeaſt part of the land, the meaning of that clauſe, <hi>poſſeſſe thou the weſt and the ſouth,</hi> muſt needs be this, that however this tribes lot

was to be ſeated in the furtheſt northeaſt corner of the kingdome, yet it ſhould reach forth ſo far both weſtward and ſouthward, that they ſhould enjoy all the benefits both of the weſtern and ſouthern parts, and the rather by their commerce with thoſe other tribes upon whom they bordered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And reacheth to Zebulun on the ſouthſide, and unto Aſher on the weſtſide, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the ſun-riſing.]</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange that this tribe ſhould be ſaid to border upon Iudah: but either the river of Iordan belonged peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly to Iudah, as a royalty given them of God above all the other tribes, in regard whereof Naphtali is ſaid to border upon Iudah in Iordan; or elſe this is added, to imply the convenient ſituation of this tribes portion, by reaſon it lay along by the banks of Iordan in a large extent. For by this means though this tribe were ſeated in the uttermoſt north part of the kingdome, yet they might by the river have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the other tribes as farre as Iudah, between whom and Naphtali many other tribes were ſeated; and ſo being the utmoſt north tribe, might in that ſenſe be ſaid to border upon Iudah, who were ſeated in the utmoſt ſouth parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer and Hammath, Rakkath, and Cinnereth.]</hi> Hammath was a city ſtanding in the utmoſt north-end of Canaan, whence the length of the land is ordinarily deſcribed to be <hi>from the entrance of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math to the river of Egypt,</hi> 1. Kings 8.65. See Num. 13.22. and Cinnereth was a city in the eaſtern parts; whence the lake, ſo often mentioned in Scripture, was called the lake of Genezereth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>Nineteen cities with their villages.]</hi> For ſome of them mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in drawing the border of their lot ſtood happely in the portion of the border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tribes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>And the ſeventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan.]</hi> Though this tribes lot was not wholly taken out of that which was given to Judah, as Simeons was, yet that a part of it was, is manifeſt by ſome of the cities mentioned here, that chap. 15. are numbered amongſt thoſe that were at firſt in Judahs por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it was compaſſed with the ſea; and the borders of the other tribes formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and ſo the borders of this tribe are here omitted.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. <hi>And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eſhtaol,</hi> &amp;c.] In this Zorah Samſon was born, Judges 13.2. and between Zorah and Eſhtaol he was buried.</p>

This then happened after Joſhuas death, but here it is mentioned, leſt it ſhould ſeem ſtrange how the Danites came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite the north parts of the land, when their lot fell to them in the ſouth parts, even cloſe by Judahs portion; the reaſon was, becauſe being not able to drive out the Philiſtines out of their land, they were ſtreightned for room, &amp; ſo went out and took Laiſh, a city that was in Naphtalies lot, though then in the Zidonians poſſeſſion, and tranſplanted a Colony thither, calling it Dan from their father Dan, the ſonne

However herein, firſt, was the modeſty of Ioſhua remarkable, that he was content to ſtay till all the tribes had their portion ere there was any motion made of that which by way of ſpeciall Prerogative was to be conferred upon him: ſecondly, That he was content to receive what God had promiſed him, as by way of gift from the people, <hi>he asked,</hi> and <hi>they gave him the city he asked:</hi> thirdly, That whereas he might have choſen the faireſt and goodlieſt city in all their tribes, he choſe his ſeat in a mountainous countrey, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo pleaſant and delightfull as many other places were, yea, and it ſeems a city that was ruinated, ſo that he was fain to build it ere he dwelt in it, for ſo it follows in the next words, <hi>and he built the city, and dwelt therein.</hi>

Concerning the myſticall reaſon of the man-ſlayers ſtaying in the city of refuge till the death of the high prieſt, ſee the note upon Num. 35.25. But to this ſome alſo do adde a literall reaſon, to wit, that hereby was implyed how hainous a fault it was to ſhed the bloud of a man, and how diſpleaſing to God, in that the man that was but unwittingly defiled with the ſhedding of bloud muſt be thus ſhut up, leſt he ſhould happen to come into the ſight of him, who did as it were repreſent Gods perſon amongſt them, to wit, the high prieſt, nor could be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſtirre from thence till he was dead.</p>

of dividing the land, that the Levites came thus to Eleazer and the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to receive from them the cities which God had appointed to be ſet apart for their dwelling. For firſt, it is not probable that there was any delay which might move the Levites to challenge their right: and ſecondly, it is as improbable that the Iſraelites did firſt ſettle themſelves in theſe cities, and then were afterwards put out to give way to the Levites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>The Lord commanded by the hand of Moſes, to give us cities to dwell in,</hi> &amp;c.] See the notes upon Numb. 35.2. &amp;c.</p>

See verſ. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the children of Aaron the prieſt, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus by Gods ſpeciall providence the prieſts were ſeated partly in the tribe of Judah, where the Temple was afterwards to be built, and partly in the two bordering tribes of Simeon and Benjamin, and ſo whilſt they ſhall approve their piety and devotion to the ſervice of God, in being content to leave their dwellings to go up unto Jeruſalem in their turns, to attend upon the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, yet withall God provides for their eaſe, that their journeys might not be over long and burthenſome to them. As for their aſſigning (as it is here ſaid) of thirteen cities to the prieſts, herein God and the governours of Iſrael had reſpect unto ſucceeding times, when the poſterity of Aaron ſhould be encreaſed; for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there were but a few prieſts, not enough to inhabit the half part of one city; but in the mean time they were given them for their poſſeſſion, which they might diſpoſe of according to the right they had in them. For that they might ſo do, and that the cities of the Levites were given them not onely for their habitation, but alſo for their poſſeſſions and inheritance, is evident in ſeverall places. See Levit. 25.32.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, theſe cities,</hi> &amp;c.] Judahs and Simeon cities are reckoned together, becauſe Simeons portion lay within Judahs, Chap. 19.1. <hi>And the ſecond lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.</hi>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42229:46"/>
Levites were taken by lot, becauſe it was not likely that both Hebron and Debir ſhould be taken out of his inheritance without the Lords ſpeciall direction. But God requiring it, Caleb willingly yields, the rather becauſe the countrey and land about was the chief of his poſſeſſion, which was not taken from him; and beſides no doubt they deſired to have the Levites, who were to inſtruct them in the Law of the Lord, to be ſeated amongſt them.</p>

I anſwer: firſt, that beſides the cities mentioned, the other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42229:46"/>
tribes had many towns and villages wherein they dwelt, which the Levites had not: ſecondly, that the chief cities are onely there mentioned; it is evident in ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that many cities which were in the ſeverall portions of thoſe tribes, are not there ſet down: thirdly, others did no doubt inhabit theſe cities, beſides the Levites: and fourthly, it is no wonder though God deals bountifully with the Levites, that were to be imployed in his ſpeciall ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>And the Lord gave unto Iſrael all the land which he ſware to give unto their fathers: and they poſſeſſed it and dwelt therein.]</hi> Though there were much of the land out of which the Canaanites were not yet expelled, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore call this truth in queſtion; for, Firſt, he had given them all by lot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongſt them, which was a kind of actuall enſtating them in it. Secondly, he had put them into poſſeſſion of the greateſt part of it; neither had he promiſed them otherwiſe, but that they ſhould poſſeſſe it by degrees, See Exod. 23.29. So both clauſes of that which is here ſaid are true; to wit, firſt, That God had given them <hi>all the land</hi> which he ſwore to give unto their fathers: and ſecondly, That they poſſeſſed it and dwelt therein; onely we muſt conceive of them ſeverally thus: to wit, 1. That he had already actually given them the whole land, and enabled them to divide it amongſt their tribes: and 2. That <hi>they poſſeſſed it and dwelt therein,</hi> to wit, by degrees; a great deal of it they had already in their poſſeſſion, and the reſt by degrees came into their hands as God had promiſed, and ſooner then they did they might have enjoyed it, had it not been for their ſinnes.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>YE have not left your brethren theſe many dayes unto this day.]</hi> That for which Joſhua here commends the Reubenites, and Gadites, and the half tribe of Manaſſeh, when he was now to diſmiſſe them and ſend them back to their own inheritance, is, That notwithſtanding the warre had laſted ſo long, yet they had not been weary of that which they had undertaken, but had continued conſtantly with their brethren to help them againſt their enemies, till God had given them reſt from their enemies as he had promiſed them. It is no where expreſſed how long the war had laſted, ere the Iſraelites were ſettled peaceably in the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; and ſo thereupon theſe tribes were ſet free to return back to their own dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; Onely by that which is ſaid concerning Calebs age, Joſhua 14.10. at that time when they were ſetting themſelves to the work of dividing the land, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that then the warres had laſted full ſeven years; and how long it was after that ere the work was fully ended, we cannot ſay. Some learned Expoſitours hold, that it was at leaſt fourteen years after the Iſraelites paſſed over Jordan, ere Joſhua ſent back theſe tribes to their own dwellings: But if it were not ſo long, not happely above nine or ten years; yet however, if we conſider that they had left their wives, and children, and eſtates behind them in a land newly conquered, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what juſt cauſe Joſhua had to praiſe them for their faithfulneſſe herein, that could be content for ſo many years together to continue with their brethren for their help, till they ſaw them peaceably ſeated each tribe in their inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Therefore now return ye, and get ye unto your tents, and unto the land
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42229:47"/>
of your poſſeſſion.]</hi> That is, from the aſſembly they were to go to their tents, and ſo from thence to the land of their poſſeſſion beyond Jordan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, be circumſpectly watchfull over your ſelves leſt you be drawn away from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what God hath enjoyned you.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>So Joſhua bleſſed them and ſent them away.]</hi> See the note chap. 14.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Divide the ſpoil of your enemies with your brethren.]</hi> That is, when you come home let your brethren there, have ſhare in the ſpoil you carry hence with you. Now this diviſion might be either that every one ſhould have an equall ſhare; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that theſe that had been in the warre ſhould have one half, and the reſt of their tribes that ſtayed behind ſhould have the other half. For ſo Moſes by direction from the Lord had ordered it in the warre that was made by a party that was ſent out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Midianites, Num. 31.27. <hi>And divide the prey into parts, between them that took the warre upon them, who went out to battell, and between all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> (concerning which, ſee the note upon that place) and it is therefore proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Joſhua followed the example of Moſes herein.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of Manaſſeh came to the borders of Jordan within the land of Canaan, before they paſſed over Jordan, they built there a very great altar after the pattern of that in the Tabernacle, and this they did (as afterwards verſ. 24, &amp;c. they make known to the meſſengers that were ſent to them about it) not with any thought to offer ſacrifices thereon, but onely to the end that altar might be in the ages to come a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall, that thoſe tribes that dwelt without Jordan were of the ſtock of Iſrael as well as they within Jordan, and had a right to come to the Tabernacle, and to offer their ſacrifices on Gods altar there as well as they, in that it would ſtill be known by tradition from their fathers to all ſucceeding generations, that that altar within Jordan was built by the tribes without Jordan when they returned that way home from helping their brethren againſt the Canaanites, when they firſt ſettled themſelves in the land of Canaan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>The whole congregation of the children of Iſrael gathered themſelves together at Shiloh, to go up to warre againſt them.]</hi> God had enjoyned his people that in caſe any of their brethren of any citie in Iſrael, ſhould fall off from the true worſhip of the true God, to the worſhip of falſe gods (and conſequently to any idolatrous worſhip whatſoever) they ſhould then gather themſelves together and utterly deſtroy the inhabitants of that city, Deut. 13.13, &amp;c. Now therefore when the Iſraelites heard of the altar, which their brethren had built on the banks of Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan in their return home, they preſently concluded, that they had done it with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to offer ſacrifices thereon (which would have been a manifeſt rebellion againſt Gods Law, wherein all the tribes of Iſrael were enjoyned to bring all their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to that one altar that was in the Tabernacle, Deut. 12.5, 6.) and thereupon they unanimouſly gathered themſelves together at Shiloh, to make warre againſt theſe tribes that had built this altar; onely they firſt ſent meſſengers (as it follows in the next verſe) to make inquiry concerning that which they had done, according to the direction of the law, Deut. 13.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt inquire and make ſearch,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42229:47"/>
though they were their brethren, that did not abate their indignation againſt them but rather increaſe it; yea the Manaſſites within Jordan were as forward as the reſt to fight in this quarrell, though one half of their own tribe was amongſt thoſe they were to fight againſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And the children of Iſrael ſent unto the children of Reuben,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to enquire concerning that which they had heard, to expoſtulate the matter with them, to try if by any fair means they might be drawn from the evil which they conceived they had done. And indeed, not onely becauſe they were brethren, but eſpecially, becauſe theſe tribes had ſo lately continued ſo many years ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with them, to help them againſt their enemies till they were ſeated peaceably in the land of their inheritance, it had been a great evil to have proceeded to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, before they had aſſayed to make up the matter in a gentle way.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Is the iniquitie of Peor too little for us, from which we are not clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto this day,</hi> &amp;c.] As if they ſhould have ſaid, Is it not enough that we did many years ſince ſo highly provoke God to diſpleaſure againſt us by ſuffering our ſelves to be drawn by the daughters of Moab to the worſhip of Baal-Peor, that we muſt now afreſh provoke God again by a new rebellion againſt his Law? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conſidering how exceedingly zealous Phinehas had been in that matter of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, when he ſlew Zimri and Cozbi in the very act of their uncleanneſſe; it is no wonder though he did particularly inſtance in this example of their former rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſhew them how dangerous a thing it was, ſo again to incenſe God againſt them, as he conceived they had done. But why doth he ſay that the Iſraelites were not yet unto that day cleanſed from the iniquitie of Peor, ſince at that time when Phinehas had ſlain Zimri and Cozbi, the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Num. 25.11. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas the ſonne of Eleazar, the ſonne of Aaron the Prieſt, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, 1. Becauſe the ſtain and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of that ſinne lay ſtill upon them, it was a mighty diſhonour to the Iſraelites un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that day, that they had ſo baſely forſaken the living God to go after the baſe idol-gods of the heathen; as many as were guilty of it, yea all indeed had cauſe to bluſh at the remembrance of it unto that day. 2. Becauſe the infection of that ſinne did ſtill cleave unto them: The governours of the people did no doubt find that the infection of Idolatry, which the Iſraelites had contracted at that time when they were drawn by the daughters of Moab to worſhip their falſe gods, did ever and anon ſtill break forth in ſome particular perſons, who were found lingring ſtill after that idolatrous worſhip: whence it was that after this, Moſes gave them that charge, chap. 24.23. <hi>Now therefore put away the ſtrange gods that are among you,</hi> &amp;c. and hence it is that they now tell their brethren that they were not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleanſed from the iniquity of Peor unto that day. Indeed the people and ſtate in generall continued uncorrupt all the dayes of Joſhua, chap. 24.31. <hi>And Iſrael ſerved the Lord all the dayes of Joſhua.</hi> But they ſpake here of that which they found in particular perſons, to wit, that though they did what they might to puniſh and ſuppreſſe idolatry, yet now and then there was ſtill ſome found, that ſhewed they were not wholly purged from that infection which they had taken ſo long ſince in the worſhip of Baal-Peor, and 3. Becauſe they were not fully cleared from the guilt and puniſhment of that ſinne. For though upon that zealous act of Phinehas
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42229:48"/>
it is ſaid, that he had turned away Gods wrath from the children of Iſrael, yet the meaning of that was onely this, that Gods wrath was thereby ſtaid from proceeding on any further in that ſlaughter, which he had enjoyned the Judges to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that had committed fornication with that Idol Baal-Peor, Num. 25.5. <hi>Moſes ſaid unto the Judges of Iſrael, Slay ye every one his men that had joyned themſelves unto Baal-Peor;</hi> all which notwithſtanding there might be many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons that God was pleaſed to ſpare at that time, whom he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards call to account, and correct them ſharply even for that ſinne; and ſo in this regard it might be here ſaid that unto that day they were not fully cleanſed from that iniquity. For juſt ſuch an expreſſion we have Num. 14.20, 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I have pardoned according to thy word: But as truly as I live,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Surely they ſhall not ſee the land which I ſware unto their fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And it will be, ſeeing ye rebell to day against the Lord, that to morrow he will be wrath,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, immediately or forthwith, for ſo this word <hi>to morrow</hi> is often taken, Matt. 6.30. <hi>Wherefore if God ſo clothe the graſſe of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven, ſhall he not much more clothe you.</hi> 1. Cor. 15.32. <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Notwithſtanding, if the land of your poſſeſſion be unclean, then paſſe ye over into the land of the poſſeſſion of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, if you think the land without Jordan unclean, becauſe ye have not Gods Tabernacle and Altar with you, as we have, then paſſe over into the land of Canaan where the Lord dwells in his Tabernacle. Doubtleſſe the countrey without Jordan was a part of the land of promiſe, onely the land within Jordan is peculiarly called, <hi>the land of the poſſeſſion of the Lord,</hi> becauſe the Lord dwelt there in his Sanctuary. Now though it would have been a great imparing to all their inheritances that were ſeated within Jordan, to have admitted theſe two tribes and a half without Jordan to come and have a ſhare with them, eſpecially at this time when as yet the Canaanites were amongſt them, and held ſo great a part of their land from them: yet this they willingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, rather then they ſhould fall off from the true worſhip of God: which ſhewed how ſingularly zealous they were, both for Gods glory, and their brethrens ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But rebell not againſt the Lord, nor rebell against us.]</hi> They call their building of an altar a rebellion, not againſt the Lord onely, but againſt their brethren alſo within Jordan, becauſe thereby they had (as they apprehended) ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from having communion with them as the true Church of God, and by this their idolatrous practiſe had provoked the Lord, as much as in them lay, to deſtroy them all, or to caſt them off from being his people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he knoweth, and Iſrael he ſhall know.]</hi> In theſe words, the tribes without Jordan, do firſt appeal to God, who knew with what intention they built that altar, as comforting themſelves with this, that however it might be ſuſpected, whether that which they ſhould ſay were true or no, God who was the ſearcher of all hearts knew, that they had not done it with any ſuch purpoſe, as their brethren ſuſpected; and the vehemency they uſe in expreſſing this, <hi>The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he knoweth;</hi> implies how hatefull the very thought of that was to them, of which they were ſuſpected;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42229:48"/>
and then in that next clauſe, <hi>and Iſrael he ſhall know,</hi> they profeſſe that this in time to come ſhould be clearly manifeſted to their brethren too; for thoſe words, <hi>and Iſrael he ſhall know,</hi> are not meant thus, that they would now tell the Iſraelites for what cauſe they had built it, but the meaning is, that in time to come, by their conſtancy in the true worſhip of God, they would make the Iſrael of God know, how farre they were from building an altar, with any purpoſe to ſacrifice thereon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If it be in rebellion, or if in tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord, (ſave us not this day)]</hi> Theſe words, <hi>ſave us not this day,</hi> are an imprecation, wherein they deſire that the Lord ſhould not ſpare them, but puniſh them according to the hainouſneſſe of ſo foul a ſinne, if they in ſetting up the altar intended any ſuch thing as they were charged with.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>In time to come your children might speak unto our children, ſaying, What have you to do with the Lord God of Iſrael.]</hi> That is, in the generations to come, your children might happely deny to ſuffer our children to offer their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at Gods altar, alledging that they were none of the Church and people of God, none of Abrahams ſeed, that Jordan was the utmoſt bounds of the land of promiſe, and that therefore thoſe without Jordan were no true Iſraelites, nor had any thing to do with the worſhip of God in his Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>This day we perceive that the Lord is among us, becauſe ye have not committed this treſpaſſe againſt the Lord.]</hi> This being the greateſt and ſureſt ſigne of Gods gratious preſence amongſt a people, when he preſerves them from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſcandalous ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now ye have delivered the children of Iſrael out of the hand of the Lord.]</hi> Not by diverting any puniſhment which the Lord was ready to inflict, but by avoiding that ſinne which might have drawn ſome heavy judgement not onely upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but upon the whole body of the people, if they had fallen into it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>For it ſhall be a witneſſe between us, that the Lord is God.]</hi> This is the reaſon which the tribes without Jordan give, why they called the altar they had ſet up <hi>Ed,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>a witneſſe,</hi> to wit, becauſe ſtanding in the middeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them within Jordan and them without, it ſhould be a witneſſe, that they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Jordan meant to acknowledge and worſhip no other God then he whom their brethren worſhipped, even the Lord Jehovah onely.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>ANd Joſhua called for all Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the repreſentative body of all Iſrael, to wit, as it is explained in the following words, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of each tribe, together with their Magiſtrates and Judges and Officers.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the Lord your God, He ſhall expell them from before you,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though I die and leave the work which is begun unfiniſhed, yet aſſure your ſelves, if you continue ſtedfaſt to the Lord, he who indeed hath done what hath been done, will perfect the work begun, and perform all that he hath promiſed; he ſhall expell the reſt of the nations that are not yet expelled before you.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>That ye come not amongst theſe nations, theſe that remain among you,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, that ye no wayes familiarly converſe with them: and this is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the firſt place, becauſe they that yield familiarly to converſe with Idolatours,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42229:49"/>
will by degrees be alſo drawn to the evils mentioned in the following words, even to make marriages with them, to ſwear by their gods, and at laſt to bow down to them and worſhip them. As for making mention of the names of their gods, the next particular here forbidden; ſee the note Exod. 23.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>But cleave unto the Lord your God, as ye have done unto this day.]</hi> By cleaving to the Lord, is meant, that they ſhould continue conſtant in yielding obedience to God, and in reſting and relying upon him, yea, upon him alone as their God alſufficient. Nor need it ſeem ſtrange unto us that he ſhould ſay of a people that had been ſo prone to rebell againſt God, <hi>Cleave unto the Lord—as ye have done unto this day.</hi> For firſt, the Iſraelites, though they were ever and anon murmuring againſt God, and turning aſide from the way of his commandments, yet they had never for the generallity caſt off the worſhip of the true God, to go after the gods of the heathen: And ſecondly, this Joſhua might ſpeak with reference to the time of his government, as ye have done to this day, that is, ſince the time you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the land of Canaan, or ſince the time you came to be under my government; for indeed ſince that time we reade not of any notable rebellion of this people againſt God; it is ſaid that <hi>the people ſerved the Lord all the dayes of Joſhua,</hi> Judg. 2.7.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Elſe if you do in any wiſe go back and cleave unto the remnant of theſe nations,</hi> &amp;c.] Here Joſhua begins to tell them how ſeverely God would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them in caſe they did <hi>go back,</hi> that is, revolt from that good way of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, wherein they had hitherto gone, <hi>and cleave unto the remnant of thoſe nations,</hi> that is, marry them and lie with them, for ſo this phraſe of cleaving to thoſe nations is explained in the following words, <hi>and ſhall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you.</hi> Yet I know that this word <hi>cleave</hi> may be meant generally of any joyning themſelves to thoſe nations either in leagues or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>But they ſhall be ſnares and traps unto you, and ſcourges in your ſides, and thornes in your eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe they will be continually by their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements drawing you to idolatry and other ſinnes, and by their injuries vexing and diſquieting you; yet ſome hold, that by being thorns in their eyes is meant, that they ſhould by degrees ſo farre blind them, that they ſhould not be able to diſcern the clear light of the truth. See Numb. 33.55.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I ſee my death approcheth; now becauſe I cannot hope long to continue amongſt you to keep you conſtant in your covenant with God, therefore I thought good to give you warning, that after my departure ye depart not from the Lord, and to tell you beforehand what will become of you, if you tranſgreſſe the covenant of the Lord your God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>So ſhall the Lord bring upon you all evill things, untill he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed you from off this good land,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as the Lord hath hitherto made good all that he hath promiſed you, ſo if you tranſgreſſe his covenant he will bring upon you all the evils threatned, even at laſt the cauſing of you to be carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive out of this good land; and this laſt judgement of deſtroying them out of the land of Canaan he particularly inſiſts upon, becauſe it muſt needs affect them to heare of loſing ſo goodly a land, when after ſo many years travels and difficulties they were now newly entred into it.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Joſhua gathered all the tribes to Shechem,</hi> &amp;c.] The aſſembly mentioned in the foregoing chapter, verſ. 2. (concerning which, ſee the note there) and the exhortation which Joſhua uſed then to the people, was when Joſhua apprehended he had not long to live, chap. 23.14. <hi>And behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth;</hi> yet it ſeems that after that, fearing much what the people world do after his death, he reſolved again to call another aſſembly of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative body of the kingdome, that he might there again preſſe them to continue conſtant in their obedience to God after his death; and to that purpoſe might cauſe them to renew their covenant with God, which accordingly he did at Shechem, as it is here ſaid. Many Expoſitours underſtand this of Shiloh, where indeed the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was ſeated, chap. 18.1. (which they ſay is here called Shechem becauſe it ſtood in the field of Shechem) and that becauſe it is ſaid in this verſe, that the aſſembly <hi>preſented themſelves before God,</hi> and becauſe verſ. 26. there is mention of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, near which under an oke there was a ſtone erected as a witneſſe of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which the people had made with God. But it is more probable, that this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was in Shechem, and that the Tabernacle and Ark were removed hither up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion: 1. Becauſe Shechem was in the tribe of Ephraim, as well as Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh, and perhaps nearer unto Joſhua his city, and ſo the more convenient for him to come thither. 2. Becauſe we no where reade that Shiloh is called Shechem (which is the onely ground of the other opinion.) 3. Becauſe it is evident that upon ſpeciall extraordinary occaſions they were wont ſometimes to remove the Ark, 1. Sam. 4.4. <hi>So the people ſent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the Ark of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord of hoſts.</hi> But why ſhould they not have met at Shiloh, that ſo there might be no need to remove the Ark? I anſwer, that Shechem was a city of great note, a city of refuge, chap. 21.21. a place famous for the abode of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs there: yea, and there God did at firſt enter into a covenant with Abraham, Gen. 12.6 7. and the people there had lately renewed their covenant with God, upon mount Gerizim and mount Ebal: in which regard Joſhua might think it the fitter to bring the people now to renew it again in the ſame place. And then beſides, there might be ſome other ſpeciall occaſion for ſome other buſineſſe that was to be done at Shechem; as happely the buriall of Joſephs bones there, whereof mention is made in the 32. verſe of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Your fathers dwelt on the other ſide of the floud in old time, even Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor.]</hi> That is, Euphrates, which is by way of eminency uſually in the Scripture called <hi>the river.</hi>

                     <hi>And they ſerved other gods.]</hi> That is, their fathers, to wit, Terah, and Abram, and Nachor (of whom they were deſcended by the mothers ſide) for they are all mentioned in the foregoing words. Neither need it ſeem ſtrange unto us that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſhould ſerve other Gods before his calling; for therein was Gods mercy the more magnified. And indeed if Abraham had continued incorrupt in an idolatrous family, the poſterity of Abraham might have boaſted in this, whereas the drift of Joſhua in theſe words is quite contrary, even to ſet forth Gods goodneſſe in reſcuing him out of that way of danger, and chuſing him to be the father of his peculiar people, when there was nothing in him to move the Lord to ſhew him ſuch ſpeciall favour.</p>

Beſides, had Joſhua known any particular families or perſons that had worſhipped idols, no doubt he would have puniſhed them according to the Law: but it ſeems in his government he had found that many of them were ſtill lingring after theſe ſuperſtitions of their fathers, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42229:50"/>
therefore feared that though they durſt not openly do it, there were ſome that ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were worſhippers of idols, whence it is that he admoniſheth them in this wiſe, to put away the ſtrange gods from amongſt them; and indeed, that in the wilderneſſe many ſecretly did worſhip idols is evident by that place, Amos 5.25, 26. which is cited by S. Stephen, Acts 7.42, 43. <hi>Then God turned and gave them up to worſhip the hoſt of heaven, as it is written in the book of the Prophets, O ye houſe of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, have ye offered to me any beasts and ſacrifices, by the ſpace of fourty years in the wilderneſſe? Yea, ye took up the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the ſtarre of your God Remphan, figures which you made, to worſhip them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And if it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chooſe you this day whom ye will ſerve,</hi> &amp;c.] Not that Joſhua did now lay the reins upon their necks and give them liberty to change their Religion, and to ſerve ſtrange gods if that way liked them beſt: Had they revolted from God doubtleſſe he would have puniſhed them ſeverely: But he uſeth this kind of ſpeech, firſt, as a powerfull perſwaſion to keep them conſtant to God, by implying that there is ſuch a difference betwixt theſe two, the worſhipping the Lord that had delivered them out of Egypt and done ſo many great things for them, and bowing to Idol-gods, that one would not think it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they ſhould forſake the Lord to follow them, though it ſhould be left to their choice: as if one ſhould ſay, chooſe you whether you will go to heaven or to hell. So that this is much like that ſpeech of Elijahs, 1. Kings 18.21. <hi>How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.</hi> Secondly, to ſift them how they ſtood inwardly affected, and to imply that unleſſe they ſerved God willingly without any conſtraint, ſo that if it were left to their choice, they would take no other way, God would not regard their outward obedience. And thirdly, that having now of their own accord accepted the Lord to be their God, they might hereby be the more tyed to cleave conſtantly unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.]</hi> This Joſhua added, not ſo much to make known to them what he was reſolved to do, to wit, that though they ſhould all forſake the Lord, yet that ſhould not one whit move him; but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, that his reſolute determination herein, of whoſe wiſdome and piety they had had ſo great experience might covertly, but yet ſweetly and effectually, perſwade them to keep conſtant in that way of religion wherein they found him ſo zealouſly and ſettledly reſolved to continue.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Ye cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is an holy God: He is a jealous God,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken upon ſuppoſition, not onely of Gods holineſſe and ſevere jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie againſt all thoſe that are not faithfull in keeping covenant with him, but alſo of the perverſe refractary diſpoſition, and untamed ſtubborneſſe of this rebellious people; as if he ſhould have ſaid, Conſider well what you ſay, God will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a profeſſion of being his people, if ye take liberty to live as you liſt, as you have done; No, God is <hi>a holy God,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that this is added not to diſcourage them, but rather by way of caution, to awake them out of their ſecurity, and to let them know that they muſt be more carefull of walking uprightly with God, if they meant to ſerve him; as if when a company of ſouldiers that had not ſo well behaved themſelves in former times, ſhould untertake ſome ſpeciall ſervice, and the Generall ſhould anſwer (not to beat them off from it, but rather to enflame them and make
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42229:51"/>
them go through it with the more courage and care) why ſhould you think of undertaking ſuch a piece of ſervice? you cannot do it; implying onely thus much, that they muſt be more valiant and conſtant then they had been, if they would med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Now therefore put away, ſaid he, the ſtrange Gods which are among you,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note above, verſe 13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>So Joſhua made a covenant with the people that day, and ſet them a ſtatute and an ordinance in Shechem.]</hi> That is, as Gods ſervant and miniſter he cauſed the people to renew their covenant with God (and doubtleſſe it was done in a ſolemn manner, being accompanied with ſacrifices and other uſuall rites of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſervice) and ſo he <hi>ſet them a ſtatute and an ordinance in Shechem,</hi> that is, he eſtabliſhed it as a thing fully ſettled and ratified for future times, that they ſhould conſtantly continue in the ſervice of the Lord God alone, as became his peculiar people, and to that end did fully make known and confirm all the conditions of the covenant which they had made with God. To which purpoſe happely the whole law of God was at this time diſtinctly read amongſt them; which ſome conceive is one of the principall things intended in this laſt clauſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And Joſhua wrote theſe words in the book of the law of God.]</hi> That is, theſe promiſes of the people and the whole carriage of this buſineſſe when they did with ſuch ſolemnity renew their covenant with God, that knowing there was ſuch a record kept of this buſineſſe even in Gods Tabernacle, they might be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to keep their covenant. But yet withall, hereby may be meant that this book of Joſhua was now added to the book of Moſes law which was laid up long ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ark, Deut. 31.26. (ſaving onely thoſe paſſages which are apparently ſince inſerted;) for no doubt that which Joſhua wrote was written for all future times; Now we have in the Church no other records, of it but this book of Joſhua.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And took a great ſtone and ſet it up there under an oke that was by the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of the Lord.]</hi> This ſtone was alſo ſet up as a memoriall of this covenant now thus ſolemnly renewed between God and the people. The place where it was ſet, to wit, <hi>under an oke that was by the Sanctuary</hi> is thus preciſely expreſſed for the better evidencing of the certain truth of that which is here related. Some indeed ſuppoſe that this was the very oke under which Jacob had many years ſince buried all the Idolatrous traſh which he found amongſt thoſe of his family, Gen. 35.4. <hi>And they gave unto Jacob all the ſtrange gods that were in their hand, and all the ear-rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oke which was by Shechem;</hi> and that Joſhua for that cauſe did purpoſely ſet up this ſtone under that oke. But though it be certain and well known that okes will continue many hundred years, yet that this was that oke we cannot certainly determine. As for the <hi>Sanctuary of the Lord</hi> here mentioned, ſome conceive it is the place onely where all this was done, that is ſo called, and that becauſe of the ark that was there; but I think it is farre more probable, that the Tabernacle was brought thither together with the ark, and that this it is which is here called <hi>the Sanctuary of the Lord.</hi> However certain it is, that in future times this place where this ſtone was ſet up by Joſhua was from hence called <hi>the plain of the pillar,</hi> or <hi>the oke of the pillar,</hi> Judges 9.6.</p>

Kings 6.1. <hi>And it came to paſſe in the foure hundred and foureſcore years, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the children of Iſrael were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth yeare of Solomons reigne over Iſrael, in the moneth Zif, which is the ſecond moneth, that he began to build the houſe of the Lord,</hi> of which yielding fourty years to their travels in the wilderneſſe, and then to Othniels government fourty years, Judges 3.11. to Ehuds eighty years, verſe 30. to Shamgars ſome few moneths, verſ. 31. to Deborah and Barak fourty, Judges 5.31. to Gideon fourty, Judges 8.28. to Abimelech three, Judges 9.22. to Tolah three and twenty, Judges 10.2. and to Jair two and twenty years, verſe 3. to Jephthe ſix, Judges 12.7. and Ibzan ſeven, verſe 9. and Elon ten, verſe 11. and Abdon eight, verſe 14. to Samſon twenty, Judges 15.20. to Elie fourty, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>And the bones of Joſeph, which the children of Iſrael brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem,</hi> &amp;c.] Joſeph had commanded the Iſraelites to carry his bones with them out of Egypt, Gen. 50.25. which accordingly they did, Exod. 13.19. Here now we are told where they buried his bones, to wit, <hi>in She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, in a parcell of ground which Jacob bought of the ſonnes of Hamor, the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of ſilver.</hi> Which was doubtleſſe the parcell of a field, mentioned Gen. 33.19. which Jacob bought of Hamor the father of Shechem, and which when he lay upon his deathbed he gave to Joſeph as a ſpeciall legacy, Gen, 48.22. and this might well be the reaſon why they buried Joſephs bones here, whereas it is evident that his forefathers and their wives too were buried in the cave of Machpelah, Gen. 49.29, 30, 31. <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith Jacob, <hi>to be gathered unto my people; Bury me with my fathers in the cave, that is in the field of Ephron the Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a poſſeſſion of a burying place. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Iſaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah,</hi> to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the inheritance peculiarly bequeathed him by his father. Indeed by the words of Stephen, Acts 7.15, 16. it might ſeem that all the Patriarchs, the ſonnes of Jacob (and ſo Joſephs bones amongſt the reſt) were buried not in the field which Jacob bought, Gen. 33.19. but in the burying-place which Abraham bought of Ephron in Machpelah, Gen. 23.17, 18. For though Stephen ſaith, they were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42229:52"/>
in a field, <hi>bought of the ſonnes of Emor the father of Sichem,</hi> yet withall he ſaith expreſſely, that they were buried in a Sepulchre purchaſed by Abraham, Acts 7.15, 16. <hi>So Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers, and were carried over into Sichem, and laid in the ſepulchre which Abraham bought for a ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> Now we reade of no burying place which Abraham bought, but that of the cave of Machpelah, which he bought of Ephron the Hittite. Gen. 23.16.17. &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is evident, Gen. 49.29, 30, 31. that Abraham and Sarah, and Iſaac and Rebekah, and Jacob &amp; Leah were buried: but to this I anſwer, that many of our beſt Expoſitours are of opinion that this place in the Acts of the Apoſtles is corrupted by the careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or rather the miſtake of thoſe that tranſcribed the copies; yet becauſe it is dangerous to allow that the Greek copies of the new Teſtament are generally falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any one paſſage, I think it is better anſwered, that though Stephen ſaid, that <hi>the fathers were laid in the ſepulchre of Abraham, bought for a ſumme of money of Emor the father of Sichem,</hi> yet he meant onely thereby, that they were laid in the Sepulchre, which the poſterity or the ſonne of Abraham bought of the ſonnes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and that was Jacob, becauſe that which the ſonne doth the father may be ſaid to do in him; and if ſo, then it ſeems that the bones of the other Patriarchs, the ſonnes of Jacob, were buried here together with Joſephs. At what time they buried Joſephs bones here, it is not expreſſed, yet by the laſt clauſe of this verſe where it is ſaid of this parcell of ground, <hi>and it became the inheritance of the children of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> it appears that it was done after they had reſt in the land, and had divided the whole countrey of Canaan amongſt the tribes; and ſo this part of Canaan where this parcell of land lay, falling then by lot to the ſonnes of Joſeph (to whom Jacob at his death had bequeathed it) here they buried the bones of their father.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his ſonne, which was given him in mount Ephraim.]</hi> Becauſe the cities that fell to the prieſts by lot were taken out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, chap. 21.4. and thence it might ſeem ſtrange that Eleazar or Phinehas his ſonne ſhould have any inheritance in mount Ephraim, wherein for that cauſe Eleazar the high prieſt ſhould be buried, ſince mount Ephraim belonged to the ſonnes of Joſeph, therefore in the laſt clauſe of this book it is expreſſely ſaid, that it belonged to Phinehas by warrant of a ſpeciall and extraordinary gift, and not by the deſignement of the lot which was drawn forth for the prieſts, it was <hi>given him in mount Ephraim.</hi> Whether this hill was given to Eleazar or Phinehas, it is not fully and clearly expreſſed, the words ſeem rather to imply, that it was given to Phinehas, <hi>they buried him in a hill which pertained to Phinehas his ſonne, which was given him in mount Ephraim;</hi> but yet it may be that the place where Eleazar was buried, is here ſaid to be <hi>the hill of Phinehas,</hi> or <hi>a hill that pertained to Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has,</hi> not becauſe it did not firſt pertain to Eleazar, but with relation to future times, whence it ſeems it was uſually called <hi>the hill of Phinehas;</hi> and the reaſon that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours give, why this place in mount Ephraim was by extraordinary gift confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the high prieſt, whereas the prieſts had their dwellings by lot in the other tribes above mentioned are theſe: firſt, that he might be near hand to Joſhua who dwelt in mount Ephraim, to the end that by him he might enquire of the Lord upon any ſpeciall ſervice. Secondly, that he might be the nearer to the Tabernacle, which at this time was in Shiloh a city in Ephraim.</p>

Who wrote this book is no where expreſſed; it ſufficeth us to know that it hath alwaies been kept in the Church amongſt thoſe Oracles of God, whoſe penmen were guided by the infallible inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Spirit, and indeed one paſſage of this book, to wit, that concerning Sampſon, chap. 13.7. <hi>the child ſhall be a Nazarite to God,</hi> is, by the judgement of many learned Expoſitours, principally intended by the Evangeliſt S.

firſt attempts would be a matter of great conſequence, either for the encouragement or diſheartning the people, therefore they would firſt enquire of the Lord, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they did: <hi>they asked the Lord,</hi> as it is here ſaid, to wit, by Phinehas the high prieſt (or Eleazar if he were yet living, which is doubtfull, becauſe he died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the death of Joſhua, Joſh. 24.33.) before the propitiatory or mercy-ſeat, <hi>who ſhall go up for us againſt the Canaanites firſt to fight againſt them?</hi> that is, which of our tribes ſhall firſt begin and ſet upon the inhabitants that ſtill abide in their lot? for this is doubtleſſe the meaning of this queſtion they asked.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Judah ſhall go up,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the tribe of Judah; becauſe that was the moſt populous and the ſtrongeſt of the tribes, and had their portion in the chief of the land, which it was therefore fit ſhould be firſt cleared of the enemie, therefore they were appointed firſt to begin the warre: and beſides, thus was that ſtill accompliſhed which Jacob prophecied concerning the preheminence this tribe ſhould have above the reſt, Gen. 49.8. <hi>Judah thou art he whom thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhall praiſe: thy hand ſhall be in the neck of thine enemies, thy fathers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall bow down before thee.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>But Adoni-Bezek fled, and they purſued after him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.]</hi> And thus as he had done to many other kings, as himſelf confeſſeth in the following verſe, to wit, either out of a kind of barbarous ſporting crueltie, or elſe to render them thereby unfit for warre ever after, that by the al-ruling providence of God is now done to him by the Iſraelites that had now taken him priſoner. Indeed we reade not that Gods people were wont to inflict any ſuch ſtrange kind of puniſhment upon thoſe that were vanquiſhed by them, nor doth it ſtand with piety thus to torture and afflict thoſe that are taken in warre, with ſuch ſtudied and uncoucht wayes of puniſhment; and beſides, the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites had an expreſſe command not to ſpare the lives of any of theſe nations, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to cut them off; and therefore as it is likely that ſome ſpeciall reaſon moved the Iſraelites to inflict this unuſuall puniſhment upon him, ſo I conceive it moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that either when they took the city they found ſome of theſe poore captive kings that had been thus inhumanely uſed by him, a ſpectacle that might well ſtirre their ſpirits againſt him; or at leaſt that they might receive information from others herein, and ſo might be moved thereby to deal with him as he had dealt with others, as judging it conſonant to that Law of retaliation which God eſtabliſhed amongſt his people, <hi>Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</hi> Exod. 21.24. Some Expoſitours indeed conceive that the Iſraelites knew not of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42229:53"/>
cruelty that he had uſed to others, till himſelf acknowledged the juſt hand of God upon him herein, verſe 7. <hi>Threeſcore and ten kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table;</hi> and ſo they aſcribe this which the Iſraelites did wholly to the ſecret providence of God, who moved them thus to return his cruelty upon himſelf, they not knowing why they did it. But no ſuch thing can be neceſſarily inferred from his acknowledgement of that which he had done to the kings that he had conquered; for either to confeſſe how many kings he had uſed ſo, or out of remorſe of conſcience being as it were conſtrained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that it was the juſt vengeance of God upon him, he might well ſay what he did, though he knew the Iſraelites had purpoſely done thus to him becauſe he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done ſo to others.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Threeſcore and ten kings, having their thumbs and great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table,</hi> &amp;c.] This need not ſeem ſtrange to us if we conſider, firſt, what petty kings there were in thoſe times; and ſecondly, that this may be underſtood of ſo many kings who at ſeverall times had been thus uſed, not that there were ſeventy all at one time thus waiting upon him: though even that is not ſo incredible, conſidering that in thoſe dayes every city almoſt had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall king. And as for their gathering or gleaning their meat under his table, the meaning is not that they lay like dogs under the table, but that they were kept as ſlaves in ſuch a manner, that for hunger they were glad to gather up the crumbs and ſcraps that fell under the kings table, as having nothing allowed them to eat but that; and happely the king to pleaſe himſelf with this cruell ſpectacle, did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſe them to be fetched in, when he was in his cups feaſting himſelf, that he might ſee them in this piteous plight whereunto he had brought them, and inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they brought him to Jeruſalem and there he died.]</hi> To Jeruſalem I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they brought him as a ſpectacle worthy to be beheld, that men might learn by him, how juſt God is in puniſhing men according to the nature of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and therefore it is moſt likely alſo that he dyed there preſently of the wounds he had received in the warre, in that ſevere puniſhment that was inflicted on him: or elſe, that he was kept there upon this extraordinary occaſion, purpoſely that men might ſee in him how God abhorres ſuch cruelty as his was, he being otherwiſe one of thoſe accurſed nations that might not be ſpared.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jeruſalem, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, before Joſhuas death: for this is added, to ſhew the reaſon why they carryed him to Jeruſalem, to wit, becauſe Jeruſalem, that is, that part of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem that was in Judahs lot, was now in their poſſeſſion, though not the fort. So that moſt Expoſitours hold, that both this and the following verſes unto verſe 17. are a repetition of the memorable acts done by the tribe of Judah whileſt Joſhua was now living: Indeed before the land was divided, all Iſrael fought as in one army againſt the Canaanites; but after the tribes were ſeated in their ſeverall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, each tribe made warre againſt the inhabitants in their ſeverall lots; and thus the men of Judah are here ſaid to have done theſe things here related; for it is not neceſſary to hold that Jeruſalem was taken when the king thereof was ſlain, Joſh. 10.23. See the note, Joſh. 15.63.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Judah went againſt the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, againſt the Canaanites that dwelt in the mountains about Hebron, which they did in the dayes of Joſhua, and under the conduct of Caleb, who then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chief. It is evident that Hebron was taken by Joſhua, concerning which ſee the note, Joſhua 10.37. and that afterwards Caleb drove out the giants that had poſſeſſed themſelves of the ſtrong holds in and about Hebron, Ioſhua 15.13, 14. Concerning which ſee the note, Ioſhua 11.21. But becauſe the Authour of this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory was here to relate the memorable exploits that were done by the men of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, therefore together with thoſe noble acts which they did after the death of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, he repeats alſo thoſe that were done by them whileſt Ioſhua was yet living, under the command of Caleb, both againſt Hebron, and againſt Debir in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes, ſo to ſet forth the glory of this tribe the more fully.</p>

                     <hi>And they ſlew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephah, and utterly destroyed it (and the name of the citie was called Hormah)]</hi> That is, <hi>utter deſtruction;</hi> they were not wont thus utterly to deſtroy all the cities they took; it is therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that they did thus deſtroy this place becauſe of the vow which the Iſraelites had made long ſince, when Arad the king of the Canaanites made warre againſt them; ſee the note Numb. 21.3. and the mention of Arad in the foregoing verſe, makes this opinion the more probable.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Alſo Judah took Gaza with the coaſt thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] Yet it ſeems ſoon after the Philiſtines recovered theſe cities with the coaſts thereof, and drave out the Iſraelites, ere they could well ſettle themſelves therein, to wit, becauſe they began preſently to provoke the Lord with their ſinnes. For it is evident that theſe cities were not long after this inhabited by the Philiſtines, chap. 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Now theſe are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And the Lord was with Judah, and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain.]</hi> This clauſe, <hi>and the Lord was with Judah,</hi> is added to ſhew of what difficulty their attempts were if the Lord had not been with them; and withall, to condemne their cowardiſe, that durſt not proceed in their conqueſts againſt the inhabitants of the valleys, having had ſuch incouraging experience of Gods aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, becauſe they had chariots of iron.]</hi> Their own fears diſabling them, and God for their ſinnes withdrawing himſelf from them. Concerning theſe chariots of iron, ſee the note Joſh. 17.16.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebuſites that inhabited Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] See Joſh. 15.63.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city.]</hi> Whence it ſeems probable that the Iſraelites did not onely ſpare his life and the life of his family, but alſo gave him a rich reward, to wit, for ſhewing them the way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bethel, as is before ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Neither did Manaſſeh drive out the inhabitants of Bethſhean,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note Joſh. 17.12. Thus in the dayes after the death of Joſhua, when it ſeems they had no one ſet over them in chief, but were onely governed by the joynt-au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Elders in each tribe, they began to be remiſſe in endeavouring to drive out the remainder of the Canaanites that dwelt in the land, but were content to make peace with them; and this was the firſt ſtep of their defection from God, which did by degrees lead them into groſſer ſinnes, and greatly provoked the Lord to diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>Yet the hand of the houſe of Joſeph prevailed, ſo that they became tributaries.]</hi> That is, though the Danites were ſorely for a time oppreſſed by the Amorites as is expreſſed before, verſ. 34. <hi>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not ſuffer them to come down to the valley;</hi> yet afterward with the help of the ſonnes of Joſeph, who bordered upon Dans por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and came up to aid them, they prevailed againſt them, ſo that they became tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. <hi>And the coaſt of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock and upward.]</hi> This is added, to ſhew how the Iſraelites through their own ſloth ſuffered themſelves to be hemmed in with theſe accurſed enemies.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd an Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim.]</hi> It is very hard to determine whether this were an Angel indeed, or ſome
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42229:55"/>
man, either prieſt or prophet, that by ſpeciall commiſſion was ſent at this time from God unto the people to reprove them for their ſinnes. The word in the originall may well be tranſlated either <hi>angell</hi> or <hi>meſſenger,</hi> as it is in the margin of our bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the reaſons are very conſiderable, which have moved many to think that it was ſome man of God that was ſent to them, to wit firſt, becauſe it is ſaid that he <hi>came up from Gilgal,</hi> not that he came down from heaven, and ſo appeared to them: and ſecondly, becauſe he ſpake in a generall aſſembly, as is evident, verſ. 4. where it is ſaid, that he ſpake <hi>unto all the children of Iſrael,</hi> whereas the appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels have been uſually onely to ſome particular men in private. But yet the moſt of Expoſitours conceive, that it was a true Angel, and that having aſſumed for this preſent ſervice the body of man, the Scripture therefore ſpeaks of him as a man, that he came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and this they hold, 1. Becauſe he ſpeaks after the manner of Angels, not <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> as the prophets were wont to ſpeak, but as in the perſon of God, <hi>I made you to go up out of Egypt:</hi> and 2. Becauſe the Authour of this book elſewhere ſpeaks differently of the prophet and the Angel, as chap. 6.8. <hi>The Lord ſent a prophet unto the children of Iſrael, which ſaid unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the houſe of bondage.</hi> But then verſ. 12. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him,</hi> that is, to Gideon, <hi>and ſaid unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</hi> Yea, ſome hold that it was the ſonne of God, the Angel of the covenant, who was wont thus to appear to the fathers, and that becauſe he aſcribes here to himſelf that which was the work of God, as the bringing this people out of Egypt, and the making of a covenant with them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, moſt probable it is, that this was done in the dayes of the Elders that outlived Joſhua, and that before they began to worſhip the Gods of the nations they dwelt amongſt; for elſe doubtleſſe this Angel or meſſenger of the Lord would have repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them for their idolatry, as well as for making a league of peace with the land. It ſeems therefore that finding themſelves ſorely annoyed by the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites in ſeverall parts of the land, there was an aſſembly of the people called of all the tribes, that they might conſult what was fit to be done, and ſo thereupon the Lord ſent his Angel to them with a meſſage; and very likely it is, that it was ſome place about Shiloh, where the people were now met together, which upon occaſion of the peoples weeping here was called Bochim, that is, <hi>weepers.</hi> For firſt, thither the tribes uſed to aſſemble themſelves, eſpecially at their three ſolemn feaſts, (and ſome generall aſſembly of the people there was at this time, as is before noted:) and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the people did offer ſacrifices there, verſ. 5. and that they might onely do where the altar and tabernacle was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>But ye have not obeyed my voice; why have ye done this?]</hi> That is, conſider how great and inexcuſable your ſinne is: for theſe words <hi>why have ye done this</hi> are as much in effect as if he had ſaid, that they had not the leaſt colour for that they had done, and that if they were challenged to give a reaſon why they had done it, they could have nothing to ſay for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>But they ſhall be as thorns in your ſides.]</hi> See the note Numb. 31.55.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they ſacrificed there unto the Lord.]</hi> Though by divine diſpenſation, or at leaſt Gods conniving at it,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42229:55"/>
the faithfull ſervants of God did ſometimes ſacrifice in other places then the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle (for ſo did Samuel at Mizpeh, 1. Sam. 7.6. and Gideon in Ophrah, Judg. 6.24.) yet there is no neceſſity that can force us to ſay it was ſo here. For this Bochim might be in Shiloh, or near about it, where the Tabernacle was, as is noted above, verſ. 1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And when Joſhua had let the people go, the children of Iſrael went,</hi> &amp;c.] In the following part of this chapter is laid down in generall the ſumme of the whole book, to wit, Iſraels idolatrie, and Gods dealing with them both in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them, and delivering them again. But the death of Joſhua and the Elders which had ſeen the works of the Lord made way to this defection of Iſrael; and therefore the ſtory firſt begins with that, and tells us how Joſhua diſmiſſed them from the camp where they had as yet continued together, and ſent them every tribe to their own portion, which by lot in the late diviſion of the land, God had given them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres.]</hi> Joſh. 24.30. it is called Timnath-ſerah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And there aroſe another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Iſrael.]</hi> We need not inquire whether there were none now alive that knew the works of the Lord; for there might be ſome that did, (as doubtleſſe there were ſome likewiſe that did not fall away with the reſt to the worſhip of idols) and yet it might be ſaid, that <hi>there aroſe another ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that knew not the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. namely, becauſe the greateſt number was of that generation that had not ſeen the works of the Lord, to wit, thoſe works which he did in Egypt, yea, many of them, not thoſe works which he did at their entrance into Canaan, the dividing of Jordan, &amp;c. and theſe they were <hi>that knew not the Lord,</hi> that is, effectually, as the other generation had done, who by the ſight of Gods wondrous works were brought truly to fear the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And the children of Iſrael did evill in the ſight of the Lord, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Baalim.]</hi> That is, the ſeverall gods of the nations; whom they called Baalim. For Baal ſignifieth a <hi>Lord,</hi> (hence were thoſe names ſo frequent amongſt the great men of Carthage, of Hannibal, and Asdrubal, and many others) whereupon they called God by way of excellency Baal, that is, the Lord, and when they came by degrees to fall to idolatry, every man of renown that after his death was worſhiped as a god, was called Baal, and by ſome of thoſe eaſtern nations Bell, Eſa. 46.1. <hi>Bell boweth down, Nebo ſtoopeth;</hi> yea, and the ſeverall planets, which by the Chaldean Aſtrologers were ſaid to rule in their ſeverall houſes in heaven, were called Baalim, that is, Lords or rulers: and ſo all the ſeverall gods of the Chaldeans, Syrians, and Canaanites, yea, and ſeverall idols and images of theſe gods were called Baalim.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Nevertheleſſe God raiſed up judges that delivered them,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, God ſtirred up men to undertake the avenging of them upon their enemies, and to govern them according to the Laws of God, and advanced them above others with the gifts of his Spirit that they might be fit for thoſe great imployments.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And yet they would not hearken unto their Judges, but they went a whoring after other gods,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, for a while they hearkned unto them, but not conſtantly; within a while after they returned unto their evil wayes, as it is more fully expreſſed, verſ. 18, 19. As for this phraſe of going a whoring after other gods, it is uſed frequently in the Scripture, to imply mens unlawfull and baſe joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſouls to idols, that were formerly entred into a covenant with God, and therefore ſhould have kept themſelves ſolely to him, as a wife to her husband; and the rather doubtleſſe, is the blind, mad, and unreaſonable zeal of idolaters compared to the violent and incorrigible luſts of whoremongers, becauſe, as they that are once inflamed with thoſe luſts are as men bewitched, no counſell or perſwaſion doth any good upon them, they care not what they ſpend, what pains they take, into what inconveniences they caſt themſelves, ſo they may ſatisfie their luſts; ſo it is with idolaters, ſo bewitched they are, that there is no diſſwading them, no charge, toil, or danger, can make them give over this abominable ſinne.</p>

they may have reference to that clauſe in the latter end of the foregoing verſe (where there is mention made of Joſhua his leaving the Canaanites unexpelled) <hi>the nations which Joſhua left when he died;</hi> and then the meaning muſt be, that the nations were not wholly driven out in Joſhua's time, but were left for the tryall of Iſrael, to wit, to ſee whether they would be drawn away by their idolatries or no: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they may have reference to all that which is ſaid in the two foregoing verſes, <hi>Becauſe this people have tranſgreſſed my covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I alſo will not henceforth drive out any from before them, of the nations which Joſhua left when he died. That through them I may prove Iſrael whether they will keep the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and then the meaning muſt be, that God for the ſinne of the Iſraelites reſolved not to caſt out any more of the Canaanites that remained in the land, that they might continually oppreſſe and vex the Iſraelites, and ſo thereby he might prove them, namely, whether by theſe afflictions they would be brought to repent and turn to the Lord, and ſo again to walk in his wayes. And indeed both theſe may be well here comprehended.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>ONely that the generation of the children of Iſrael might know to teach them warre,</hi> &amp;c.] Two reaſons were given in the latter end of the foregoing chapter, why the Lord did not wholly caſt out the Canaanites out of the land in the dayes of Joſhua, and here now a third is added. Some conceive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the meaning of this clauſe to be this, that by leaving the Canaanites amongſt them, God would now let this wicked generation know to their coſt what warre is; their fathers, by the extraordinary help which the Lord afforded them, did ſoon vanquiſh their enemies, and knew not the miſery that warre uſually brings with it, but this their degenerate poſterity, being now forſaken of God, ſhould know to their ſorrow what warre is. But according to our tranſlation, I conceive the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words to be rather this, that God left theſe inhabitants of the land unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, that the future generations might hereby be made carefull to train up their people in martiall diſcipline, that ſo they might be the better able to perform what God had enjoyned them, in not ſuffering any of the Canaanites to remain in the the land. And this it is, I conceive, that in theſe words the holy Ghoſt doth chiefly aim at, not ſo much their teaching the people the skill of the warre, as their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein, to wit, that they might obey the Lords command in driving out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of this people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Namely, five Lords of the Philiſtines,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the nations are reckoned that were not caſt out of Canaan; and the firſt mentioned are the five Lords of the Philiſtines, to wit, the Lords of Aſhdod, Gaza, Askelon, Gath, and Ekron; indeed three of theſe cities were at firſt taken by the men of Judah after the death of Joſhua, to wit, Gaza, Askelon, and Ekron; but it ſeems the Philiſtines ſoon recovered them again. See chap. 1.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the children of Iſrael dwelt amongſt the Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c.] from the eleventh verſe of the foregoing chapter unto this place, we have had a ſummary deſcription of the ſtate of Iſrael in the dayes of the Judges; and here now the Authour of this ſtory enters upon the particular ſtory of Othniel, the firſt of the Judges, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

us in the firſt place what their ſinnes were that brought them into that bondage, out of which Othniel delivered them.</p>

                     <hi>And the children of Iſrael ſerved Cuſhan-riſhathaim eight years.]</hi> It ſeems to me evident, that for ſome years after the death of Joſhua the people continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the worſhip of the true God, chap. 2.7. <hi>And the people ſerved the Lord all the dayes of Joſhua, and all the dayes of the Elders that out-lived Joſhua,</hi> &amp;c. and doubtleſſe ſome few years it was after they fell to idolatry ere God ſold them into the hand of this king of Meſopotamia; and therefore how long after the death of Joſhua theſe eight years began, of Iſraels bondage under the king of Meſopotamia, we cannot ſay.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And when the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, the Lord raiſed up a deliverer,</hi> &amp;c.] The word in the Hebrew ſignifieth <hi>a ſaviour,</hi> but thereby is meant, one that delivered them from the bondage they were in, and this was Othni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, who was the ſonne of Calebs brother, and withall his ſonne in law, as being married to Achſah his daughter, chap. 1.13. for that noble exploit of his in taking Debir; and this was the honour of the children of Judah, that the firſt judge after Joſhua, was of their tribe, the Lord therein making good that prophecy of Jacob, Gen. 49.8. <hi>Judah thou art he whom thy Brethren ſhall praiſe, thine hand ſhall be in the neck of thine enemies, thy fathers children ſhall bow down before thee.</hi> Many hold that Othniel became Judge of Iſrael immediately after the death of Joſhua; but me thinks it is clear in this place that it was not till towards the end of the eight years of Iſraels bondage under Cuſhan-riſhathaim king of Meſopotamia; for it is ſaid, that then the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, and thereupon God raiſed up Othniel to be a deliverer, that is, God did then, by a ſpeciall inſtinct of his Spirit, ſtirre him up to make warre againſt this tyrant, for the deliverance of his people, and furniſhed him with all neceſſary gifts and graces of his Spirit, both for the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing of the enemie, and for the government of the people, which it ſeems upon this occaſion he took upon him. But yet, if Othniel took Debir, and thereupon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Calebs daughter whilſt Joſhua was yet living, as many Expoſitours hold he did, hereby we may probably gather, that it was not many years after Joſhuas death ere the Iſraelites were thus oppreſſed by this king, and ſo thereupon Othniel was raiſed up of God to be their Judge.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him.]</hi> That is, God by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did poure forth upon him an extraordinary meaſure of all gifts requiſite for the ſervice he was to undertake; and withall, did ſecretly but mightily work upon his ſpirit, in moving him to undertake that ſervice for which he had fitted him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And the land had reſt fourty years.]</hi> That is, unto the expiration of fourty years, to wit, from the death of Joſhua. It is a great queſtion amongſt Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours, whether the years wherein the Iſraelites are ſaid in this book to have been in bondage under thoſe nations that prevailed over them, and the years wherein the Judges are here ſaid to have judged Iſrael, and wherein the land is ſaid to have been
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42229:57"/>
in reſt, are to be accounted as ſeverall diſtinct years, or no; and ſo it is in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place, ſome holding that the land had reſt fourty years under Othniels go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, after thoſe eight years wherein the king of Meſopotamia had tyrannized over them, and others holding that both the eight years of the bondage of Iſrael under Cuſhan-riſhathaim, and the foregoing years wherein the Iſraelites lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Judge, under the joynt-government of their Elders, and had not yet by their ſinnes brought themſelves into bondage, are to be all comprehended under the fourty years here mentioned; and indeed theſe laſt I conceive are in the right, unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as may be thus made evident. It is expreſſely ſaid, that from the Iſraelites going out of Egypt, to the building of the Temple in the fourth yeare of Solomons reigne, there were but four hundred and eighty years, 1. Kings 6.1. <hi>And it came to paſſe in the foure hundred and fourſcore yeare, after the children of Iſrael were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth yeare of Solomons reigne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that he began to build the houſe of the Lord.</hi> Now firſt, if to the fourty years of the children of Iſraels wandring in the wilderneſſe, and the ſeventeen years of Joſhua, we adde the ſeverall years of Iſraels bondage mentioned in this book of Judges: and ſecondly, the years wherein the land is ſaid to have reſted: and thirdly, the ſeverall years of the Judges from Abimelech to Eli: and fourthly, the years of Eli, Samuel, and David, we muſt ſay then, that there were well nigh ſix hundred years from the Iſraelites going out of Egypt, to the building of the Temple in the fourth year of Solomons reigne, (yea though we allow no time of diſtance between the death of Joſhua and the eight years of Cuſhan-riſhathaims tyranny, which would be abſurd) and this cannot ſtand with that place, 1. Kings 6.1. Beſides, in one place of this book it is plain, that the years of the Judges are confounded with thoſe of the enemies oppreſſing the land, namely, chap. 15.20. where it is ſaid of Samſon, <hi>that he judged Iſrael in the dayes of the Philistines twenty years,</hi> and why therefore may it not be ſo with the other Judges too? I make no queſtion therefore, but under the fourty years here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>And the land had reſt fourty years,</hi> we muſt comprehend both the eight years of Iſraels bondage under the king of Meſopotamia, and all the years before that bondage of the Iſraelites, even from the death of Joſhua. The main objection againſt this is, how the land can be ſaid to have reſted fourty years, if part of thoſe fourty years it was waſted with war, and the people held under a miſerable bondage? But to this I anſwer, 1. That it is not unuſuall in the Scripture to denominate a full number of years, from that which is properly true onely of the greater part of that number, as we ſee Gen. 35.26. where after the naming of the twelve ſonnes of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, this clauſe is added, <hi>Theſe are the ſonnes of Jacob that were born to him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan-Aram,</hi> and yet Benjamin is mentioned amongſt them, who was not born in Padan-Aram, but in the land of Canaan; and ſo likewiſe, Acts 7.14. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Joſeph ſent and called his father and all his kindred, threeſcore and fifteen ſouls,</hi> and yet indeed there went but threſcore and tenne of them at that time into Egypt, Gen. 46.27. and ſo again, Exod. 12.40. where it ſaid, <hi>that the ſojourning of the children of Iſrael, who dwelt in Egypt, was foure hundred and thirty years,</hi> and yet they were not in Egypt above two hundred and fifteen years. And 2. that the meaning of theſe words, <hi>And the land had reſt fourty years,</hi> may be, that the land had reſt unto the end of fourty years, to wit, counting the fourty years
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42229:58"/>
from the death of Joſhua to the death of Othniel; and ſo indeed Junius tranſlates theſe words <hi>uſque ad quadrageſimum annune,</hi> unto the expiration of fourty years, for ſo the like expreſſion we find, chap. 14.17. where it is ſaid of Samſons wife, that <hi>ſhe wept before him the ſeven dayes while the feaſt lasted,</hi> and yet the meaning is onely, that ſhe wept to the ending of thoſe ſeven dayes, to wit, from the time he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to tell her the meaning of his riddle.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the Lord ſtrengthened Eglon the King of Moab againſt Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he gave him courage and ſtrength to invade Iſrael, and proſpered his attempts againſt them, whereas otherwiſe happely they would have been afraid to meddle with a people that had been ſo victorious.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And went and ſmote Iſrael, and poſſeſſed the city of palm-trees.]</hi> That is, Jericho, Deut. 34.3. Jericho was indeed wholly burnt by the Iſraelites, Joſh. 6.24. and was not rebuilt till Ahabs dayes, 1. Kings 16.43. but the meaning therefore is, that this Eglon King of Moab, having vanquiſhed the Iſraelites in battell, poſſeſſed himſelf of the land and territory thereabouts where the city Jericho formerly ſtood; and either built ſome ſtrong fort there, or poſſeſſed himſelf of ſome fort that might he there before, and that to the end he might have the command of the foords of Jordan, both becauſe there was the paſſage over towards his own countrey the land of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab; and becauſe by this means he ſhould be the better able to keep the Iſraelites with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Jordan, and thoſe without, from joyning their forces together againſt him: and hence it was, that when Ehud began to raiſe the countrey againſt the Moabites, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſlain Eglon their king, the firſt thing they did was to take the foords of Jordan, verſ. 28. <hi>They went down after him, and took the foords of Jordan towards Moab, and ſuffered not a man to paſſe over.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>So the children of Iſrael ſerved Eglon King of Moab eighteen years.]</hi> How long it was after the death of Othniel ere theſe eighteen years of the Iſraelites bondage under Eglon began, it is not expreſſed; onely this is clear, that firſt the Iſraelites revolted to idolatry after Othniels death, and then the Lord brought Eglon againſt them for it. However, obſervable it is, that whereas their firſt bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under Cuſhan-riſhathaim king of Meſopotamia continued but eight years, ver. 8. this next under Eglon continued eighteen years; and ſo the next too after that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Jabin king of Canaan, continued twenty years, chap. 4.3. <hi>Twenty years he migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily oppreſſed the children of Iſrael:</hi> and thus when lighter corrections did no good the next were ſorer and of longer continuance; and becauſe they abuſed Gods readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to repent and withdraw his hand when they cried unto him, he continued the next judgements the longer upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>The Lord raiſed them up a deliverer, Ehud the ſonne of Gera, a Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamite, a man left-handed.]</hi> Some conceive, that this laſt particular of his being left-handed, is purpoſely expreſſed, to intimate by what weak means and diſpiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments God is wont many times to effect his greateſt works; but becauſe it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally held, that no men are ordinarily more able and ſtrong and fit for any ſervice then left-handed men, (whence it is noted, chap. 20.16. that amongſt the children of Benjamin <hi>there were ſeven hundred choſen men left-handed, every one could ſling ſtones at an hairs breadth, and not miſſe,</hi>) therefore I conceive that this is here noted of Ehud, the ſecond judge that God raiſed to the Iſraelites, to imply rather the fitneſſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42229:58"/>
of the inſtrument whom God choſe for this ſervice of killing Eglon, to wit, in that the ſtroke of ſuch men is far the more harder either eſpied or guarded. When Ehud began firſt to be judge of Iſrael, it is not expreſſed: Some conceive that Ehud was judge immediately after Othniels death, and that he was their judge both in the time of their apoſtaſie after Othniels death, and likewiſe all the eighteen years that the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were in bondage under Eglon king of Moab; and whereas it is here ſaid, that <hi>when the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, the Lord raiſed them up a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Ehud the ſonne of Gera;</hi> they take the meaning hereof to be onely this, that God raiſed up the ſpirit of Ehud their judge, to undertake the deliverance of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites from their bondage, and not that he was then firſt raiſed to be their judge. But methinks, according to the plain order of the words, it ſhould rather ſeem that upon the crying of the Iſraelites to the Lord, when they had been eighteen years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bondage of Eglon, the Lord ſtirred him up to undertake their deliverance; and thereupon afterwards he became their judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And by him the children of Iſrael ſent a preſent unto Eglon king of Moab.]</hi> Which Ehud embraced as a fit opportunity for the killing of Eglon, becauſe it would make him to be the leſſe ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>But Ehud made him a dagger (which had two edges) of a cubit length, and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.]</hi> Having reſolved with himſelf to kill Eglon, he provided him a dagger accordingly; concerning which it is noted, 1. That it <hi>had two edges,</hi> that it might peirce the more readily, and make the more deadly wound. 2. That it was but <hi>of a cubit length,</hi> to wit, that it might be the better carried unſeen under his garment. and 3. That <hi>he did gird it upon his right thigh,</hi> namely for the conveniency of drawing it forth with his left hand; as for the ſame reaſon thoſe that are right-handed uſe alwayes to wear their weapons on their left ſide.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Eglon was a very fat man.]</hi> This is expreſſed to intimate, that hereby Ehud had the better advantage to do what he intended; for being ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent and unwieldy man, he was the leſſe able to decline the ſtroke which Ehud gave him; and beſides the wound was like to be the more deadly.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And when he had made an end of offering the preſent, he ſent away the people that bare the preſent.]</hi> Theſe words, <hi>he ſent away the people,</hi> may imply the greatneſſe of the preſent, becauſe there were ſo many to bear it to the king: he ſent them away before he would do the act he intended (going himſelf along with them till he came to Gilgal, and then returning again) both that being alone he might the more conveniently accompliſh his deſigne, and alſo that they might be out of danger, and himſelf not be incumbred with care for them, when he was to ſlie for his life.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>But he himſelf turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and ſaid, I have a ſecret errand to thee, O king.]</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>quarries,</hi> may alſo be traſlated <hi>graven images,</hi> as it is in the margine of our bibles; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it might well be that this Moabitiſh king had ſet up certain idols in Gilgal, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vex the Iſraelites therewith, (who happely eſteemed Gilgal the more, becauſe there their forefathers had been circumciſed, and there the Tabernacle was for many years together,) or elſe that the Iſraelites might be wonne to worſhip them; or elſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42229:59"/>
by way of honouring his idol-gods, as it were teſtifying hereby, that by their help he had entred ſucceſſefully upon the land of Iſrael; and then the mention that is here made of theſe images may be, to intimate one reaſon amongſt other, wherewith God ſtirred the ſpirit of Ehud againſt Eglon, namely, becauſe he had ſet up his idol-gods in the land of Iſrael. But if we reade the word as it is in our bibles, <hi>quarries,</hi> that is, pits out of which they cut hewed ſtones for their buildings, then doubtleſſe the drift of this clauſe is onely to ſhew how far Ehud went back with thoſe that went with him, before he returned again to the king of Moab. As for thoſe firſt words which he ſpake to Eglon when he came back to him, <hi>I have a ſecret errand to thee, O king,</hi> it might be truly ſaid in relation to that which he had to do; an errand he had which was to be delivered to him in ſecret, though not by word of mouth, but by the ſtroke of his dagger; and it was from God from whom he had his commiſſion. Yet ſurely Ehud intended that Eglon ſhould underſtand him ſo, as if in his return home he had been ſent back with ſome meſſage of great ſecreſie, which he was now come back to deliver. Neither yet can we ſay that Ehud did evil in this his diſſembling with Eglon, and that becauſe he had no doubt his call and warrant from God for what he did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who ſaid, Keep ſilence,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he bad Ehud forbear delivering his errand, till his ſervants and attendants were gone out of the room.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And he was ſitting in a ſummer parlour, which he had for himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.]</hi> That is, wherein Eglon uſed to be private by himſelf; which is added, that it may not ſeem ſtrange that his ſervants waited ſo long without after Ehud was gone, it was becauſe it was a room wherein he uſed ordinarily to be alone by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Ehud ſaid, I have a meſſage from God unto thee. And he aroſe out of his ſeat.]</hi> Ehud had told the king before, ver. 19. that he had a ſecret errand unto him, (concerning which ſee the note there:) now he addes that the meſſage he brought him was from God, partly perhaps that being aſtoniſhed with that word, he might take the leſſe heed to the drawing out of his dagger; but eſpecially no doubt,
becauſe whilſt the king was ſitting he could not ſo certainly give him ſuch a ſure and deadly wound with one ſtroke as he deſired to do; and he hoped that at the mention of a meſſage from God, either out of aſtoniſhment or in reverence to God, from whom the meſſage was brought, he would not fail to ariſe out of his ſeat; as indeed it proved, <hi>And he aroſe,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>out of his ſeat.</hi> So far did thoſe blind ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious heathens reverence the very name of God, that though Eglon was a king, and withall a groſſe unweildy man, yet hearing of a meſſage from God, <hi>he aroſe out of his ſeat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger,</hi> &amp;c.] Ehud was extraordinarily called of God to do this, verſ. 15. <hi>When the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, the Lord raiſed them up a deliverer, Ehud the ſonne of Gera, a man left-handed.</hi> Nor is this therefore any warrant for the aſſaſſination of Princes, though tyrants and oppreſſours of the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And the dirt came out.]</hi> It is rendred in the margine of our bibles, <hi>It came out at the fundament,</hi> thereby meaning, that he ſtruck with ſuch ſtrength that the dagger that went in at his belly, came out behind at his fundament; but becauſe the dagger was but <hi>of a cubit length,</hi> verſ. 16. and the king was ſuch a fat groſſe man, I rather think that it is better tranſlated as it is in our text, that <hi>the dirt came out,</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:42229:59"/>
meaning his excrements; for though this be uſuall with men that die any violent death, yet I conceive it is noted here to the reproch of this tyrant, who by the juſt judgement of God was now left tumbling in his own dung, that had ſo many years oppreſſed the people of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Then Ehud went forth through the porch.]</hi> This his going out the way that he came is expreſſed, to note the compoſedneſſe of his ſpirit after this that he had done; as one that knew well that he had done nothing but what was pleaſing to God, &amp; that having done nothing but what God had called him to do, God would ſecure and ſhield him in his way, he went quietly through the kings guard and other ſervants, not diſcovering in his countenance the leaſt diſquiet or perplexitie of mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhut the doores of the parlour upon him, and locked them.]</hi> That is, he pulled too the doore and locked it, to wit, either by clapping too the doore, as ſpring-locks uſe to ſhut, or with the key which he might carry away with him: for that which is ſaid verſ. 25. may be meant of another key which the kings ſervants might have in their keeping; and this he did that whilſt his ſervants waited long for the opening the doore, he might have the more time to eſcape away, before they came to know their maſter was ſlain: as we ſee it fell out, verſ. 26. <hi>And Ehud eſcaped while they tarried, and paſſed beyond the quarries, and eſcaped unto Seirath.</hi>

Sam. 24.3. <hi>And he came to the ſheep-cotes by the way where was a cave, and Saul went in to cover his feet.</hi> Yet there is another expoſition of this phraſe, <hi>Surely he covereth his feet in his ſummer chamber,</hi> that is, ſurely he hath laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down to ſleep in his ſummer chamber; and many reaſons move me to approve of this rather then the former, though the whole current of Expoſitours take the former to be unqueſtionably the meaning of the words: For firſt, it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the kings ſummer chamber was a place where he uſed ſometimes in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to lay himſelf down to reſt a while: ſecondly, there was more reaſon why his ſervants ſhould wait long for the opening of his doors (as it is ſaid they did, verſ. 25. even <hi>till they were aſhamed</hi>) out of an opinion that he was laid to ſleep in his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chamber, then out of opinion that he was all that while eaſing himſelf: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the reaſon given why it ſhould be ſaid of him that in eaſing himſelf <hi>he covereth his feet,</hi> to wit, becauſe in doing that, as they ſunk down with their bodies their long garments covered their feet, ſeems farre more forced, then that which is given why thoſe that are laid down to ſleep in the day time, ſhould be ſaid to cover their
feet; to wit, becauſe they uſed to caſt ſome covering over their feet when they laid themſelves down to ſleep, and went not into a bed, whence it is ſaid of Ruth when ſhe went to lie down by Boaz, as he lay ſleeping at the end of his heap of corn, Ruth 3.7. that <hi>ſhe uncovered his feet, and laid her down:</hi> and fourthly, becauſe where the ſame phraſe is uſed in ſpeaking of Sauls going into a cave where David and his men were, 1. Sam. 24.3. <hi>Saul went in to cover his feet;</hi> it may beſt of all be underſtood that Saul went in to lie down and ſleep there for a while, becauſe it is hard to ſay how David ſhould there cut off the skirt of his robe and not be perceived, if he had not been aſleep.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And the land had reſt fourſcore years.]</hi> That is, to the end of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years, to wit, from the death of Othniel. See the note above, verſe 11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Shamgar the ſonne of Anath, which ſlew of the Philiſtines ſix hundred men with an ox-goad.]</hi> That is, ſay ſome Expoſitours, with ox-goads; for conceiving it improbable that one man with an ox-goad ſhould ſlay ſo many hundred Philiſtines, they hold the meaning of this clauſe to be onely this, that the Philiſtines making ſome in road into the land of the Iſraelites, Shamgar did on a ſudden raiſe the countrey thereabouts, &amp; that they having no other arms did with their ox-goads ſet upon the Philiſtines &amp; ſlew ſix hundred of them; but becauſe it is not probable that the Iſraelites that bordered upon the Philiſtines ſhould be thus unprovided of arms, nor is it any more incredible that Shamgar ſhould make ſuch a havock amongſt the Philiſtines with an ox-goad, then that Sampſon ſhould do the like with the jawbone of an aſſe, therefore I rather think that as the letter of text runnes, Shamgar by the wondrous help of God did alone perform this admirable exploit. It is not expreſſed whether Shamgar judged Iſrael or no, yet becauſe it is ſaid <hi>And after him was Shamgar the ſonne of Anath,</hi> therefore it is commonly held
that he was the next Judge after Ehud: onely they ſay it was but for a very ſhort time, and thence it is that there is no mention of the lands reſting under him, and the ſtory of Deborah in the following chapter begins as if ſhe were the next after Ehud, there being no mention made there of Shamgar at all, verſ. 1. <hi>And the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael did evill in the ſight of the Lord when Ehud was dead.</hi> However this miraculous deliverence which he wrought for the Iſraelites was certainly after Ehuds death, for then, it ſeems, the people returned to their former ſinnes, and the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Philiſtines thereupon to invade the land, but then he alſo delivered them miraculouſly by this worthy, till finding that they would not be warned by theſe things he ſold them into the hands of Jabin, as it is expreſſed in the following chapter.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the children of Iſrael again did evill in the ſight of the Lord when Ehud was dead.]</hi> In none of the Judges dayes did the Iſraelites enjoy ſo long a peace, as in the dayes of Ehud, as is evident in that clauſe (however we underſtand it) chap. 3.30. <hi>Moab was ſubdued under the hand of Iſrael, and the land had rest fourſcore years;</hi> and here we ſee what effect this long peace wrought amongſt them, and how ill they requited the Lord for ſo great a mercy; even as ſtanding waters are wont to putrifie, ſo they were corrupted by their long peace, and by degrees fell off from God, as they had formerly done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the Lord ſold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor.]</hi> See the note chap. 2.14. There was a Jabin that reigned in Hazor formerly (who it is likely was called as this is here <hi>king of Canaan;</hi> for Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor is there ſaid to be the head of all the neighbouring kingdomes, Joſh. 11.10.) the ſame who was the cheif in that confederacy againſt Joſhua, Joſhua 11.1. but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42229:60"/>
he was ſlain by Joſhua and his city burnt with fire, Joſh. 11.11. It ſeems therefore that this was ſome one of that ſtock who afterward recovered from the Iſraelites that part of the land, and repaired the city Hazor, and ſo reigned there again as his predeceſſours had done. When this was done we cannot ſay, but doubtleſſe it was not in Joſhuas time as ſome think; for it is not to be thought that the Lord ever ſuffered the Canaanites to recover any part of the land which the Iſraelites had taken from them, till they by their ſinnes had provoked the Lord to anger againſt them. But now at laſt not contented with his own kingdome, it ſeems he made warre with the Iſraelites in generall, brought them into bondage, and no doubt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them the more cruelly in revenge of that Joſhua had done to Hazor and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin king thereof, Joſh. 11.11. who perhaps was his father or grandfather. And beſides, it muſt needs be moſt terrible to the Iſraelites to be oppreſſed by the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites of all other nations, becauſe God had promiſed to caſt them out before the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites; ſo that their prevailing over them was in a ſpeciall manner a ſigne that God had caſt them off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Captain of whoſe host was Siſera, which dwelt in Haroſheth of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.]</hi> So called (as it is probably thought) becauſe in the time of the Iſraelites prevailing againſt the ſeverall nations of the Canaanites, many of them fled thither as to a place of great ſtrength, and there fortified themſelves unto this time; or elſe for the reaſons given in a like caſe, Joſh. 12.23.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>For he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppreſſed the children of Iſrael.]</hi> Concerning theſe chariots of iron, ſee the note Joſh. 17.16. This clauſe, <hi>and he mightily oppreſſed the children of Iſrael,</hi> is no where elſe inſerted, where mention is made of the bondage of Iſrael under other kings, and therefore it ſeems this king did farre more cruelly oppreſſe them then the reſt had done, which might be, partly from the deadly hatred which the Canaanites above other nations did bear to the Iſraelites, becauſe the Iſraelites had taken their land from them; and partly from the juſt vengeance of God upon the Iſraelites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had afforded them ſo long a peace in the dayes of Ehud, chap. 3.30. and they had made ſo ill an uſe of his long-ſuffering and goodneſſe therein. See the note alſo, chap. 3.14.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And Deborah a propheteſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] A woman, the weaker ſex, that the glory of the work might be given to God, and not to the inſtrument he uſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And ſhe ſent and called Barak the ſonne of Abinoam, out of Kedeſh-naphtali,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Kedeſh in the tribe of Naphtali, to diſtinguiſh it from other towns of the ſame name in other tribes, as Kedeſh in Iſſachar, 1. Chron. 6.72. Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſh in Judah, Joſh. 15.23. and others. Now Deborah did thus ſend for Barak, not of her own head chuſing him as a man of eminency for the undertaking of the ſervice, but by ſpeciall direction from God, as the words ſhe ſpake to Barak when he came to her do imply, <hi>Hath not the Lord God of Iſrael commaded, ſaying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor,</hi> &amp;c? Deborah was a propheteſſe, and therefore no doubt God had revealed unto her that which now ſhe imparted to Barak, to wit, either by ſecret inſtinct of his Spirit, or perhaps, by the miniſtry of an Angel: for that ſome Angel did appear to her, either before or after the battell which they fought with Siſera, ſeems evident in that clauſe of Deborahs ſong, chap. 5.26. <hi>Curſe

                     <hi>And take with thee ten thouſand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulun.]</hi> To wit, firſt, becauſe they were neareſt at hand: ſecondly, becauſe Naphtali was likely to be the forwardeſt in this work, becauſe Barak was of that tribe, and they were moſt oppreſſed, Hazor and Haroſheth being both in their tribe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And Barak ſaid unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go,</hi> &amp;c.] Barak, no doubt, believed what Deborah had told him in the foregoing words as from the Lord, namely, that Siſera ſhould be vanquiſhed by him, and therefore we ſee that he was willing to hazard his life and all that he had in riſing againſt this mighty king that had brought the Iſraelites into bondage; whence it is that Barak is commended for his faith by S. Paul, and reckoned amongſt thoſe <hi>who through faith ſubdued kingdomes,</hi> Heb. 11.32, 33. But why then did he refuſe to undertake the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice enjoyned him unleſſe Deborah would go along with him? I anſwer, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he conſidered that Deborah being a propheteſſe, he ſhould have a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in having her with him to pray for them, to give them counſell, and to adviſe them what to do upon every occaſion; but partly alſo no doubt, becauſe his faith was alſo accompanied and aſſaulted with doubtings and fears, as we may ſee by Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs anſwer in the following verſe, wherein ſhe diſcovered what a fault it was ſo doubtfully to yield to what God had enjoyned him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>The journey that thou takest ſhall not be for thine honour; for the Lord ſhall ſell Siſera into the hand of a woman.]</hi> Thus ſhe yields to go with him, but withall ſhews him, that becauſe of his diſtruſtfulneſſe and fear the Lord would now deprive him of a great part of that glory he ſhould otherwiſe have had: Becauſe he would not undertake the enterpriſe without the ſupport and encouragement of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans preſence, therefore a woman ſhould carry away a great part of the honour of this victory, to wit, Jael the wife of Heber, into whoſe hands Siſera ſhould fall, and by whom he ſhould be ſlain.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedeſh,</hi> &amp;c.] The chief ſtrength therefore of the army conſiſted of thoſe that by Barak were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of theſe two tribes; whence alſo is that, chap. 5.18. <hi>Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field:</hi> where yet that ſome of the other tribes did alſo voluntarily joyn in this warre made againſt Siſera, Deborah in her ſong doth plainly acknowledge, verſ. 14. <hi>Out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim was there a root of them against Amalek, after thee Benjamin among thy people: Out of Machir came down governours,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law of Moſes, had ſevered himſelf from the Kenites,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe the Kenites were ſeated amongſt the children of Judah, chap. 1.16. leſt we ſhould won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the mention that is made in the following part of this chapter of Heber the Kenite, dwelling near Kedeſh in the tribe of Naphtali, this is here premiſed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Heber, to wit, that for ſome reaſons not expreſſed in the text, he had ſevered himſelf from the reſt of the Kenites, and pitched his tent amongſt the tribe of Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali, as indeed the Kenites it ſeems did alwayes dwell not in houſes, but in tents.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the Lord diſcomfited Siſera,</hi> &amp;c.] For though the Iſraelites pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42229:61"/>
by force of arms, yet it was of God that they did prevail, Prov. 21.31. <hi>The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battell, but ſafety is of the Lord.</hi> Beſides, Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus reports that the Lord ſent a terrible tempeſt, wherewith the Canaanites being both terrified and diſordered, the Iſraelites did the more eaſily put them to flight; and indeed, ſome ſuch thing thoſe words ſeem to intend, chap. 5.20. <hi>They fought from heaven, the ſtarres in their courſes fought against Siſera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>For there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor, and the houſe of Heber the Kenite.]</hi> Though the Kenites came in with the Iſraelites, and were in a manner incorporated amongſt them, profeſſing the ſame religion, and worſhiping the ſame God, and living with all love and amity with them, yet Jabin was willing to grant peace to them (onely perhaps taking ſome certain tribute of them, by way of acknowledging his ſovereignty) whileſt he oppreſſed the Iſraelites with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cruelty: Firſt, becauſe they lived as ſojourners amongſt the Iſraelites, and laid no claim to the land. Secondly, becauſe they were found to be given to a peaceable paſtorall kind of life, and not like to riſe up in rebellion againſt him. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord turned the heart of this heatheniſh king towards them; and that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely, becauſe they had kept themſelves pure from thoſe idolatrous and ſinfull courſes, whereunto the Iſraelites had plunged themſelves, that ſo in them his people might ſee wherefore it was that the Lord had brought ſuch miſeries upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Jael went out to meet Siſera, and ſaid unto him, Turn in my lord, turn in to me, fear not.]</hi> The event diſcovers plainly that ſhe intended his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; and therefore though her words may be interpreted ſo, as if ſhe intended that ſhe would not have him be afraid, but commit himſelf to her cuſtody; yet ſince ſhe could not but know that her words would be underſtood by him, as if ſhe intended that in her tent he might and ſhould be ſafe; I ſee not what can be ſaid herein to quit her from ſinne, but onely that what ſhe did herein ſhe did by virtue of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary warrant and authority from God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, ſhe covered him with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.]</hi> To wit, as pretending herewith to cover him, and hide him, in caſe any of thoſe that purſued him ſhould come in thither; or elſe to keep him warm being now in a great heat by reaſon of his flying on foot from thoſe that followed him; or elſe that he might the more readily fall aſleep, that ſhe might do to him what no doubt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhe had purpoſed with her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And ſhe opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink.]</hi> Though he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for water, which men in great heat and thirſt do eſpecially deſire, yet ſhe fetched a bottle of milk and gave him of that, either thereby to teſtifie her great reſpect of him, that ſo he might the more ſecurely confide in her; or elſe becauſe milk, when men that are hot drink largely of it, doth naturally encline men to ſleep, and that ſhe deſired to bring him to, that then ſhe might do to him what whileſt he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake ſhe could not hope to do: and therefore when Deborah commends Jael this is particularly expreſſed as an act of ſpeciall prudency and policy, chap. 5.25. <hi>He asked water and ſhe gave him milk, ſhe brought forth butter in a lordly diſh.</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42229:62"/>
Spirit of God, chap. 5.24. and therefore there is no queſtion to be made of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of that ſhe did: for though it is ſaid, verſ. 17. <hi>There was peace between Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin and the houſe of Heber,</hi> yet that is not to be underſtood of any mutuall league (for princes do not uſe to enter into treaties of that nature with men of ſuch inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our rank, whom they have no cauſe to fear) but onely that Jabin had (happely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promiſe of ſome yearly tribute) yielded that his houſe ſhould live in peace.

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen ſang Deborah, and Barak the ſonne of Abinoam,</hi> &amp;c.] Deborah is firſt named here, becauſe ſhe was a propheteſſe, and (as upon this ground it is probably thought) the compoſer of this ſong, and in every reſpect the chief in this buſineſſe, as we ſee in the former chapter; yet with her Barak is joyned too, who as he was the chief Commander in the victory gotten, ſo he was alſo one of the prime in ſinging Gods praiſes; and he being of the tribe of Naphtali, we have in this ſweet ſong one inſtance of the accompliſhment of that prophecy of Jacob concerning the tribe of Naphtali (though it were not intended of this onely) to wit, that this tribe ſhould give goodly words, Gen. 49.21. <hi>Naphtali is a hind let looſe, he giveth goodly words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord for the avenging of Iſrael, when the people willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered themſelves.]</hi> Principally hereby are meant thoſe of the tribe of Zebulun and Naphtali, of whom Baraks army did chiefly conſiſt, though ſuch of the other tribes as did put too their helping hand are not excluded: and theſe are ſaid to <hi>have offered themſelves willingly;</hi> becauſe they did readily yield to follow Barak when he called them together, though he had no authority to conſtrain them to take up arms, God working their hearts thereto, to whom therefore the praiſe is principally given, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord for the avenging of Iſrael, when the people willingly offered themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Heare, O ye kings; give eare, O ye princes,</hi> &amp;c.] Deborah undertaking in this ſong to aſcribe to the Lord the glory of that victory which ſhe and Barak had gotten over Siſera, to ſhew what a glorious work God had therein done for his people, in the firſt place in a poeticall ſtrain ſhe calls upon kings and princes to hearken to her, <hi>Heare, O ye kings; give eare, O ye princes;</hi> thereby onely to imply, that in the ecſtaſie of her joy, ſhe could be glad if all the kings and princes of the earth could heare what ſhe had now to ſay concerning this great work which God had done for his Iſrael, and ſhe addreſſeth her ſpeech particularly to kings and princes, Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are moſt ready to aſcribe to themſelves the glory which is due to the Lord onely: and ſecondly, becauſe they are wont in their pride to oppreſſe others, and to think they may do whatſoever they pleaſe; and therefore ſhe deſired they might
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42229:62"/>
know what God had done to Jabin and Siſera, and ſo beware of provoking God by oppreſſing others as theſe had done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Lord, when thou wenteſt out of Seir, when thou marcheſt out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled,</hi> &amp;c.] The moſt of Expoſitours underſtand this to be a poeticall expreſſion of the terrours werewith the neighbouring nations were affrighted, when the Lord carried the Iſraelites from the borders of Edom towards the land of Canaan, to wit, that there was then a trembling on every ſide, ſo that not men onely but even the heavens and mountains and hills ſeemed to tremble and melt away, and that even as Sinai trembled and ſhook at the Lords coming down upon it when the Law was given (for to that end they conceive the melting or ſhaking of Sinai is mentioned, verſ. 5. <hi>The mountains melted from before the Lord, even that Sinai, before the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> to wit, by way of ſimilitude) ſo when the Lord in a pillar of fire marched before the Iſraelites againſt the Amorites, the neighbouring nations were terribly amazed, the Lord caſting ſuch a fear upon them, as if the earth had trembled, and great ſtorms and tempeſts intermixt with thunder and lightnings had been ſhowred down from the clouds, yea as if the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains had melted, &amp;c. according to that, Deut. 2.24, 25. <hi>Riſe ye up, take your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and paſſe over the river Arnon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee, and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heavens, who ſhall hear report of thee, and ſhall tremble, and be in anguiſh becauſe of thee.</hi> But I rather conceive, that it is to be underſtood of thoſe thunders, lightnings, earthquakes, tempeſts, and ſuch other terrible expreſſions of Gods majeſtie, wherein he manifeſted himſelf unto his people at the giving of the Law; for then he is alſo ſaid to come from Seir, Deut. 33.2. <hi>And he ſaid, The Lord came down from Sinai, and roſe up from Seir unto them, he ſhined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of ſaints: from his right hand went a fiery Law for them,</hi> and the ſhaking of Sinai we ſee is expreſſely mentioned, verſ. 5. <hi>The mountains melted from before the Lord, even that Sinai before the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> as it is alſo, Pſal. 68.7, 8. <hi>O God when thou wenteſt forth before thy people, when thou didſt march through the wilderneſſe. Selah. The earth ſhook, the heavens alſo dropped at the preſence of God; even Sinai it ſelf was moved at the preſence of God, the God of Iſrael;</hi> and though there be no mention of the clouds dropping water at the giving of the Law, yet there is of thunders and lightnings, which are uſually accompanied with violent ſhowers. But why ſhould Deborah mention this here? I anſwer, firſt, becauſe Gods entring into covenant with them is the ground of all that he doth for his people: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe ſhe would the better expreſſe how terrible God had been now to their adverſaries, by comparing the terrours of this day with thoſe when the Law was given on mount Sinai; and to intimate, that God continued to do the ſame things ſtill for his people that he had done for them from their firſt coming out of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>In the dayes of Shamgar the ſonne of Anath, in the dayes of Jael the high-wayes were unoccupied,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, even from the death of Ehud, whom Shamgar ſucceeded (though he was a worthy champion, and did miraculouſly avenge the Iſraelites upon the Philiſtines) unto this preſent time, wherein Jael lived (though ſhe were a woman of an heroicall ſpirit, and one that grieved to ſee the poore people of God ſo miſerably oppreſſed, as was evident by that which ſhe had now done for

                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>They choſe new gods, then was warre in the gates.]</hi> That is, then was there warre in every city, the Lord letting looſe the neighbouring nations to make warre againſt the ſeverall cities of Iſrael, becauſe they were corrupted with their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Becauſe a great part of the ſtrength of their cities was in their gates, therefore Deborah ſets forth the warre that was made againſt the Iſraelites cities, by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>then was warre in the gates;</hi> but withall, it may alſo imply the prevailing power of the enemy when they made inroads into their land, to wit, that they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times came up to the very gates of their cities.</p>

Riding on aſſes it ſeems was a

                     <hi>Then ſhall the people of the Lord go down to the gates.]</hi> Hereby many things may be implyed: firſt, their freedome to go forth at the gates of their cities, within which they were in a manner cooped up before: ſecondly, the reſtoring of the people to the gates, as places of judicature, from which they were reſtrained; before there was warre in the gates, now there was Law and judgement there: thirdly, their returning to the cities that were thence baniſhed or fled, and the countrey peoples reſorting thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon their ſeverall occaſions.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek,</hi> &amp;c.] Here Deborah commends thoſe tribes from whom there came any conſiderable party to Barak to help them againſt Jabin and Siſera: as, Firſt, ſhe begins with Ephraim, and in ſhewing that there were ſome of that tribe, ſhe uſeth this expreſſion, <hi>Out of Ephraim was there a root of them againſt Amalek:</hi> for the underſtanding whereof we muſt know, 1. That Amalek is here named becauſe it ſeems the Amalekites came out to help Jabin and Siſera againſt the Iſraelites: It is evident in many places that the Amalekites bordered upon the Canaanites, and indeed dwelt amongſt them, and therefore is it that they are often joyned together; as Numb. 14.25. <hi>Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley:</hi> and again, verſ. 43. <hi>The Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites and the Canaanites are there before, and ye ſhall fall by the ſword,</hi> &amp;c. and verſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>5. <hi>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill, and ſmote them,</hi> &amp;c. Now therefore as the Amalekites were alwayes ready to aid the Canaanites againſt the children of Iſrael, ſo it ſeems it was now; and hence it is that Amalek is here mentioned as the enemie againſt whom they fought, though the warre was made againſt Jabin king of Canaan to wit, becauſe the Amalekites ſent ſome few forces from them; and perhaps too, becauſe the Ephraimites were nearer to the Amalekites, then thoſe of Zebulun and Naphtali, of whom the chief ſtrength of Baraks army did conſiſt, it may be probably thought, that thoſe of Ephraim that armed themſelves for this war, were aſsigned of Barak to the ſervice of going out againſt the Amalekites, to keep them from coming to joyn their forces with thoſe of Jabins, whileſt he with his army went againſt Siſera. And 2. for thoſe words <hi>there was a root of them, Out of Ephraim there was a root of them againſt Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> that phraſe I conceive is either uſed, I. becauſe this riſing up of the Iſraelites againſt Jabin, did firſt ſpring up from Ephraim, to wit, in Deborah who dwelt in mount Ephraim, chap. 4.5. and ſome of her neighbouring Ephraimites that went out with her: or II. with reference to Joſhuahs fighting againſt Amalek, when the Iſraelites came out of Egypt, to imply that there was a root of Joſhuahs zeal againſt Amalek in his brethren the Ephraimites, which now ſprung up and ſhewed it ſelf in their forwardneſſe and zeal againſt the Amalekites that were at that time in arms to help Jabin: or III. to intimate that there were but few of this tribe (one root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many) that did riſe up and help Barak in this notable attempt; which as it was a ſtain to that tribe in generall, ſo it was the greater honour to thoſe of the tribe that did appear in the buſineſſe, to wit, becauſe the backwardneſſe of their brethren did not diſcourage them. Secondly, there were many alſo of the tribe of Benjamin that bordered upon Ephraim, which is thus expreſſed, <hi>After thee Benjamin among
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42229:64"/>
thy people;</hi> the drift whereof is, I conceive, to note that the tribe of Benjamin came in more freely then thoſe of Ephraim, there was but <hi>a root of Ephraim,</hi> but Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min came in with good numbers of his people. And again, the Benjamites came firſt in, and then ſome of the Ephraimites that followed their example came in alſo, and joyned with them; yea if we conceive (which we may moſt probably as I ſaid before) that theſe tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin were deſigned by Barak to go againſt the Amalekites, to keep them from coming to the aid of Jabin; then is this expreſſion moſt fit, <hi>from Ephraim there was a root againſt Amalek, After thee O Benjamin amongst thy people,</hi> to wit, becauſe the tribe of Benjamin lay neareſt to the Amalekites, and ſo the Ephraimites came in after and joyned with them to go againſt Amalek. Thirdly, there were ſome alſo of the tribe of Manaſſeh, <hi>Out of Machir came down governours.</hi> Machir was the onely ſonne of Manaſſeh, and ſo by the children of Machir are commonly meant the tribe of Manaſſeh: See Joſh. 13.31. But yet in this place it muſt be meant of that half of the tribe of Manaſſeh that was ſeated within Jordan, to wit, that ſome of them, yea of their governours, came down to help Barak againſt their great oppreſſours: for in the 17. verſe we ſee plainly that Deborah complains of the other half of Manaſſeh, that were ſeated in Gilead without Jordan, that none of them would hazard themſelves in this cauſe, <hi>Gilead,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>abode beyond Jordan.</hi> And fourthly, out of Zebulun they came in ſo unanimouſly, that even their Doctours, and Scribes, and Lawyers, and others that were better at their pen then their ſword, came yet amongſt the reſt to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemies of Gods people, <hi>And out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the Princes of Iſſachar were with Deborah; even Iſſachar and alſo Barak he was ſent on foot into the valley.]</hi> That is, both the Princes and indeed the common people too of the tribe of Iſſachar did readily come in to Deborah, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Barak their Commander in chief, with whom he went on foot into the valley, that is, the valley by mount Tabor where the river Kiſhon ran, chap. 4.12, 13. And this laſt clauſe is added, to ſhew the zeal and forwardneſſe of Barak and the other Princes of Iſſachar, in that they did not onely come in to the help of their brethren, but alſo were content to endure any trouble, and to expoſe themſelves to any danger for the furtherance of the cauſe, ſerving on foot, and that in the valley, a place of greateſt advantage for Siſera that came againſt them with chariots and horſemen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the diviſions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.]</hi> This clauſe with a very little alteration is repeated in the next verſe, <hi>for the diviſions of Reuben there were great ſearchings of heart,</hi> and in both places by <hi>the diviſions of Reuben</hi> are meant, either the Reubenites dividing themſelves from their brethren, that had combined together againſt that proud tyrant, that had ſo cruelly oppreſſed them, in that they ſtood aloof from them, and would not joyn to help them; or elſe rather, the diviſions that were amongſt the Reubenites, whereby they were kept from ſending any aid to their brethren in that juſt warre of theirs againſt the Canaanites, though ſome were for the caſting off the yoke of Jabin, and therefore judged it meet to joyn with Barak and their brethren that were riſen up againſt him; yet others on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide oppoſed this vehemently, and alledged that they had ſubmitted to be tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42229:65"/>
to Jabin, and might not therefore take up arms againſt him; and a third ſort that could have been glad to be eaſed of Jabins yoke, yet judged it beſt for them to ſtand as neuters, and wait what the iſſue of the warre would be, and that becauſe Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin was too mighty for the Iſraelites, and all they did was by the incouragement of a woman; if they ſided with their brethren, then if Jabin prevailed they ſhould be ſurely ruined, but if they ſat ſtill and did nothing, though the Iſraelites did prevail they ſhould do well enough; and ſo becauſe of theſe factions and diviſions amongſt them, they could not agree together. Now whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>for the diviſions of Reuben,</hi> or (as it is in the margine of our Bibles) <hi>in the diviſions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart;</hi> or as it is verſ. 16. <hi>great ſearchings of heart,</hi> if we reade it <hi>in the diviſions of Reuben,</hi> then it may be meant of the plotting and contriving thoughts which the Reubenites had in their hearts, by way of conſidering how they ſhould carry themſelves in this riſing of Barak and their brethren againſt Jabin and Siſera: But if we reade it (as it is in our Bibles) <hi>for the diviſions of Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben there were great thoughts of heart,</hi> and verſ. 16. <hi>great ſearchings of heart,</hi> then it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of their brethren the Iſraelites, that had taken up arms againſt Jabin, to wit, that when they perceived that there were ſuch diviſions amongſt the Reubenites, and that thereupon they deſerted them in this cauſe, and came not out to help them, they had <hi>great thoughts of heart,</hi> that is, great ſwelling thoughts of diſcontent againſt them, of murmuring and heart-burnings, and of ſharp cenſures which in their minds they paſſed upon them, and ſo likewiſe <hi>great ſearchings of heart,</hi> that is, of wondring and muſing in their minds, why they that were ſuch a rich and potent tribe ſhould ſo deſert their brethren in ſo juſt a cauſe, and not put too their helping hand for the ſuppreſſing of a tyrant, who had ſo mightily oppreſſed them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Why abodeſt thou among the ſheep-folds, to heare the bleating of the flocks?]</hi> Becauſe the Reubenites were exceeding rich in cattell, Num. 32.1. <hi>The children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattell,</hi> therefore they forbore to take up arms againſt Jabin, for fear of being plundred if he ſhould prevail; but withall, to excuſe themſelves for not going out with Barak, that was engaged againſt this Canaanitiſh king that had ſo ſorely oppreſſed them, they pretended they could not be ſpared from attending on their flocks; and therefore doth Deborah here upbraid this tribe for ſtaying at home <hi>among the ſheep-folds, to heare the bleating of the flocks,</hi> thereby implying what a poore and mean thing it was, and what a baſe and ſordid ſpirit it argued, for them to ſtay at home for ſuch mean imployments, when ſuch a great work was in hand as the vanquiſhing ſuch a potent tyrant as Jabin was, and the breaking of that yoke that had been ſo heavy upon the necks of Gods people, willing them as it were to conſider, whether the complaints, the cryes and grones of Gods oppreſſed people had not been more worthy their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding, and whether the ſounding of trumpets and other warlike inſtruments had not been more worth the hearing at ſuch a time as this, then the bleating of their flocks.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Gilead abode beyond Jordan,</hi> &amp;c.] Here Deborah reproves divers other tribes that came not in to afford any help for the ſuppreſſing of Jabin, and that in ſuch a manner as if ſhe ſhould ſay, that the very mentioning of the reaſons that moved
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42229:65"/>
them, or which at leaſt they pretended for their not taking up arms, was enough to condemne them; as firſt, the Gileadites, that is, the tribe of Gad and the other half tribe of Manaſſeh (for they had the countrey of Gilead for their lot, as we ſee Joſh. 13.24, 25, 31. Deut. 3.12, 13. and Num. 32.40.) <hi>Gilead,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>abode beyond Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> that is, they pretended that they dwelling ſo far off could not come in to the help of Barak, at leaſt time enough; and becauſe Hazor and his captain Siſera had not yet broken over Jordan againſt thoſe tribes that dwelt there, they hoped that they ſhould be ſafe enough, and that he would let them alone if they did not engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this warre againſt him; not conſidering that the Iſraelites within Jordan and thoſe without being all brethren, united together under one God as fellow-members of the ſame body, it was not fit that they ſhould ſo ſlight the preſervation of thoſe that dwelt furtheſt off from them, and that it was a folly to think that Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin would ſpare thoſe without Jordan, if the other tribes within Jordan were once deſtroyed, Secondly, the tribe of Dan, <hi>Why</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>did Dan remain in ſhips?</hi> the meaning is, That the Danites having their lot cloſe upon the Mediterranean ſea, (for Japho or Joppe, and much beſides of the Weſtern coaſt was in their lot, Joſh. 19.46.) they pretended that they were ſeamen and merchants, and could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſpared to go to this warre, becauſe of their traffick and voyages that they had in hand; and perhaps they hoped, that if things proved never ſo ill, they could the moſt of them ſecure themſelves and their eſtates by flying away in ſhips; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would not meddle with ſo dangerous an attempt as this was of making war againſt ſuch a potent king; and what a high degree of wickedneſſe was this, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their own private profit before the publick good, and ſo to mind their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſafety, as not to care what became of their brethren ſo they could ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that too not without the loſſe of their intereſt in that land which God had given them for their inheritance. And thirdly, the tribe of Aſher, <hi>Aſher continued on the ſea-ſhore, and abode in his breaches,</hi> that is, they dwelled alſo nigh to the ſea, pretending the ſame neceſſity of ſtaying, to mind their voyages, and merchandiſe; and beſides, they alledged their breaches, that is, either the breaches which the ſea had made in their banks, that were to be immediately made up, unleſſe they would ſee their countrey over-flown; or elſe, the breaches and ruinate places in the walls of their cities, pretending that they durſt not leave their cities in ſuch a weak conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leſt in their abſence the neighbouring Canaanites ſhould ſet upon their cities, and at thoſe breaches enter and take them; all which were excuſes as weak as the reſt to keep them from ſo brave a ſervice as this was, of ſuppreſſing this king of Canaan, that had ſo mightily oppreſſed them, eſpecially when God promiſed that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper them therein.</p>

Nor need it ſeem ſtrange that theſe kings are ſaid to have fought againſt the Iſraelites <hi>in Taa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach by the waters of Megiddo,</hi> whereas before, chap. 4.6, 7. the ſtory ſeemed to imply, that the battell was fought about mount Tabor and the river Kiſhon, which is alſo confirmed Pſal. 83.9. <hi>Do unto them as to the Midianites, as to Siſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, as to Jabin at the brook of Kiſhon:</hi> for to this I anſwer, firſt, that Taanach and Megiddo were not farre from mount Tabor and the river Kiſhon: for though Taa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach and Megiddo belonged to the half tribe of Manaſſeh within Jordan, chap. 1.37. <hi>Neither did Manaſſeh drive out the inhabitants of Bethſhean and her towns, and Taanach and her towns — nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns;</hi> yet they ſtood within the compaſſe of Iſſachars portion, and that bordered upon Zebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun where mount Tabor was; Joſh. 17.11. <hi>And Manaſſeh had in Iſſachar, and in Aſher, Bethſhean and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns.</hi> And ſecondly, that it may well be that the Canaanites being put to the worſt about mount Tabor, where they did firſt pitch battell, they might retire or fly to Taanach, and there making a ſtand might renew the battell again, and ſo were there wholly diſcomfited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They took no gain of money.]</hi> The meaning of this clauſe may be, that theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites came for the love of the cauſe, and not for gain, and ſo proffered to ſerve freely without pay, as thirſting for bloud more then money, or at leaſt reſolving to pay themſelves out of the riches of the Iſraelites, and that withall it proved truer then they were aware of, becauſe that in ſtead of gaining any thing, they loſt all.</p>

How this curſe here denounced againſt this people fell upon them we reade not; but that it was not without effect even this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords ſome probable ground of conjecture, that of this Meroz we find not after this the leaſt mention in any ſtory of ſucceeding times.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the children of Iſrael did evill in the ſight of the Lord, and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian ſeven years.]</hi> By the evill which the children of Iſrael did, is principally meant their fearing and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping the gods of the Amorites, verſ. 10. <hi>And I ſaid unto you, I am the Lord your God, fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whoſe land you dwell, but ye have not obeyed my voice;</hi> but yet when the Lord undertook to puniſh them for this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were becauſe they had not proceeded ſo farre herein as in former times, or for ſome other reaſon known onely to the Lord, evident it is that he laid not his hand upon them ſo heavily now, as he had done formerly, both becauſe the miſery that God brought upon them laſted but <hi>ſeven years;</hi> and alſo, becauſe we reade not that theſe Midianites did bring the Iſraelites into bondage as other their oppreſſours had done, but onely made inroads every year into the land, and ſo robbed and pillaged their countrey: whence it may be it is, as ſome have obſerved, that it is not ſaid here (according to the expreſſion elſewhere uſed) <hi>the Lord ſold them into the hand of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> but that <hi>the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian.</hi>) What it was at this time that moved the Midianites to invade the land of Iſrael we need not enquire. The Iſraelites indeed in the latter dayes of Moſes had made warre with the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and deſtroyed multitudes of them, of which ſee the note, Numb. 31.17. and it may be that the Midianites pretended now the taking revenge upon the Iſraelites for that; but however, the Midianites (though the poſterity of Abraham) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deadly enemies to the Iſraelites: and beſides, when the Lord means to puniſh a people for their ſinnes, he can bring againſt them what nation he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And becauſe of the Midianites, the children of Iſrael made them dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.]</hi> That is, many of thoſe dens, and caves, and ſtrong holds which are in the land of Canaan, the Iſraelites made at this time, to wit, to hide themſelves and their eſtates therein from the Midianites, the poorer ſort the dens and the caves, and the other the ſtrong holds and forts: and thus at firſt they onely thought to ſhelter themſelves by theſe outward means, and did not ſeek to make God their hiding place, but all in vain, and therefore at length they ſaw their folly herein, and then as it is ſaid, verſ. 6. <hi>They cryed unto the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And ſo it was when Iſrael had ſowen, that the Midianites came, and the Amalekites, and the children of the East.]</hi> That is, and other the children of the Eaſt, to wit, of Arabia that lay eaſtward of Canaan. Even the Midianites were of theſe eaſtern nations (for they paſſed over Jordan that was on the eaſt ſide of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan when they invaded the land, and therefore when Gideon had overcome them, he ſent to the inhabitants of mount Ephraim, chap. 7.24.25. to ſtop them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning over Jordan) but they were aided it ſeems by other of theſe eaſtern nations that bordered upon them, as the Iſhmaelites, mentioned chap. 8.24. <hi>For they had golden earings, becauſe they were Iſhmaelites,</hi> and ſome others. Now it is noted that theſe nations came up every year into the land of Canaan <hi>when Iſrael had ſowen,</hi> becauſe the end of their coming was to eat up with their cattell the green corn, that ſo they might impoveriſh and ſamiſh the Iſraelites. For the moſt of theſe eaſtern people dwelt not in cities and towns, but in tents onely, which they uſed to remove
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42229:67"/>
from one place to another, carrying their cattell along with them, whence is that of the Prophet, Eſa. 13.20. <hi>It ſhall never be inhabited, neither ſhall it be dwelt in from one generation to another, neither ſhall the Arabian pitch tent there, neither ſhall the ſhepherds make their fold there:</hi> and ſo it was it ſeems with the Midianites, and therefore every ſpring <hi>when the Iſraelites had ſowen</hi> they came up with their tents and cattell that they might eat up all the encreaſe of the land, and therefore partly are they compared to graſſehoppers, or locuſts, verſ. 5. <hi>they came up with their cattell and their tents, as graſſehoppers for multitude,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And they encamped againſt them, and deſtroyed the encreaſe of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza,</hi> &amp;c.] Gaza lay on the coaſt of the midland weſtern ſea; and ſo they entered on the eaſt, and went quite through the land, even as farre as Gaza that lay on the Weſtern coaſts, deſtroying all as they went, ſo that <hi>they left no ſuſtenance for Iſrael,</hi> that is, none in a manner, they took from many of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites all their ſuſtenance, and impoveriſhed all by taking away the greateſt part of that they had.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>The Lord ſent a Prophet unto the children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] This was to prepare them for the deliverance he intended them by Gideon, by calling them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of life.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>I am the Lord your God, fear not the gods of the Amorites,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, worſhip not the Gods of the Amorites; becauſe religious worſhip is alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the fear and reverence of that God whom men worſhip, therefore fear is often put for the whole worſhip that is to be yielded to God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And there came an Angel of the Lord, and ſat under an oke,</hi> &amp;c.] This Angel was the ſonne of God, who is therefore called Jehovah, verſ. 24. <hi>And Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovah-Shalom,</hi> but not deſiring to ſeem to Gideon any other then ſome Prophet ſent unto him from the Lord, he ſat down as a man wearied with travell, and deſirous to reſt himſelf (and therefore as a traveller he had a ſtaff in his hand too, verſ. 21. <hi>Then the Angel of the Lord put forth the end of the ſtaffe that was in his hand</hi>) and that <hi>under an oke, that was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joaſh the Abi-ezrite:</hi> that is, who was of the poſterity of Abiezer, Joſh. 17.2. and conſequently of the tribe of Manaſſeh, as verſ. 15. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, Wherewith ſhall I ſave Iſrael? Behold, my family is poore in Manaſſeh,</hi> which is added partly to diſtinguiſh this Ophrah from another that was in the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his ſonne Gideon threſhed wheat by the wine preſſe, to hide it from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites.]</hi> This Gideon was doubtleſſe the next that judged Iſrael, after Deborah; yet I do not conceive that he was now Judge when the Angel appeared unto him, and ſo had been all the ſeven years of the Iſraelites oppreſſion by the Medianites but rather that he was called now thereto when he was called to deliver the Iſraelites from the Midianites. However, that he was a man of rank in the citie where he lived is evident by the mention that is made, verſ. 27. of his taking <hi>ten of his ſervants</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him when he went to do that which God enjoyned him: and the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable therefore is that which is noted of him, that the Angel found him threſhing his wheat. For hereby was plainly diſcovered that he was a man of an humble ſpirit, not diſdaining any honeſt labour (and indeed we often find that when God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42229:68"/>
any ſpeciall favour to his ſervants, he hath as it were to teſtifie his approving of this, conferred it upon them ſtill when they were ſo imployed:) and withall this doth plainly ſhow what a ſad condition the poore people of God were in at this time, when ſuch a man as Gideon was glad to threſh his corn to hide it from the Midianites, not daring happely to truſt his own ſervants with the doing of it: for which cauſe alſo it ſeems he threſhed it out with a rod or flail, &amp; did not tread it out with oxen, as the cuſtome of thoſe times was, becauſe this way it might be done both more cloſely and ſpeedily, and that too <hi>by the wine preſſe,</hi> where corn would not be looked for, and where perhaps he might threſh it out and not be heard when he was doing it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, was ſeen of Gideon, and then ſpake to him as followeth, <hi>The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour;</hi> the title here given to Gideon, <hi>thou mighty man of valour,</hi> may imply that he had been imployed in military affairs; but however it implyes that God now had and would ſtill indue him with ſtrength and courage to withſtand the enemies of his people: and this ſalutation, <hi>the Lord is with thee,</hi> though it implyes Gods favourable preſence, and all the comfortable effects thereof, yet here it hath reference chiefly to that implyed in the title given him, that God would be with him in his courageous oppoſing of the Midianites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the Lord looked upon him, and ſaid, Go in this thy might,</hi> &amp;c.] The Lord by fixing his eyes ſo ſeriouſly upon him, as it were with affection and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, did doubtleſſe ſilently intimate the ſame that he expreſſed immediately in the words he ſaid unto him, to wit, that he was the man choſen of God to deliver his people from theſe grievous calamities that now they indured, <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in this thy might,</hi> that is, in the might of which he had formerly ſpoken, when he called him <hi>thou mighty man of valour,</hi> the might wherewith God had now fitted him, to be a worthy inſtrument of ſaving his people, <hi>and thou ſhalt ſave Iſrael from the hand of the Midianites; have not I ſent thee?</hi> that is, know that the Lord hath ſent thee, and hath impoſed this task upon thee, and therefore having both authority and a promiſe of ſucceſſe from him, thou mayeſt courageouſly undertake this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith ſhall I ſave Iſrael?</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe Gideons faith is commended, Heb. 11.32, 33. and becauſe withall, the Angel did not reprove him for this he now ſpake, but onely ſatisfied him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he now inquired of, it may ſeem probable that he ſpake not theſe words, <hi>wherewith ſhall I ſave Iſrael?</hi> as not believing what was promiſed, but becauſe knowing his own inſufficiency for ſo great a work, and being conſcious to himſelf of the weakneſſe of his faith, he deſired to be informed how this ſhould be done that was promiſed, as being glad to have his faith ſtrengthned, leſt thoſe unlikely hoods which his reaſon diſcerned ſhould be any hinderance to him, either in believing what was promiſed, or undertaking what was commanded: and ſo the like may be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his deſiring of ſignes, verſ. 17, 36, 37.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Surely I will be with thee, and thou ſhalt ſmite the Midianites as one man.]</hi> That is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as eaſily as thou mayeſt ſmite one man.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>If now I have found grace in thy ſight, then ſhew me a ſigne that thou talkeſt with me.]</hi> That is, thou ſpeakeſt to me in the name of the Lord, ſaying,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42229:68"/>
                     <hi>I will be with thee, and thou ſhalt ſmite the Midianites as one man:</hi> now therefore make it manifeſt to me by ſome ſigne or other <hi>that thou talkeſt with me,</hi> that is, that thou art that ſame Lord, that great Angel of God, at whoſe command I may ſafely undertake this enterpriſe. See the foregoing note upon verſe 15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Depart not hence, I pray thee, untill I come unto thee, and bring forth my preſent and ſet it before thee.]</hi> Becauſe the word here tranſlated <hi>my preſent</hi> may alſo ſignifie <hi>a meat-offering,</hi> (and ſo therefore it is rendred in the margine of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) therefore many Expoſitours conceive that Gideon meant to fetch out a ſacrifice, which he meant ſhould be offered by himſelf, or by the Angel; but there is no juſt ground for this conceit in the Text. The Hebrew word, which commonly ſignifieth <hi>a meat-offering,</hi> is frequently alſo uſed for any <hi>preſent,</hi> or gift in generall, as before chap. 3.15, 17. where there is mention made of a preſent that Ehud carried; the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word is the ſame that is uſed here, and which ordinarily is tranſlated <hi>a meat-offering:</hi> and ſo it is in many other places. Beſides, had Gideon intended to fetch out a ſacrifice, would he have brought out a kid ready boyled, together with the broth, as in the following verſe we ſee he did? when do we reade of any ſuch ſacrifice? Queſtionleſſe therefore Gideon intended no ſacrifice, but onely meant to bring forth ſome proviſion or other for this meſſenger ſent from God unto him, that he might eat thereof and refreſh himſelf, as Abraham did for thoſe Angels that appeared unto him, Gen. 18.5. and that the rather, becauſe he expected ſome ſigne from him, whereby he might know whether he were the great Angel of God, or whether he were ſome Prophet or other meſſenger ſent unto him from God, concerning which he was not yet fully ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe theſe might ſuddenly be made ready.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord ſaid unto him, Take the fleſh and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and poure out the broth, and he did ſo.]</hi> Though Gideon brought theſe things forth for the repaſt of this man of God (for ſuch he conceived him to be) yet at his command he thus diſpoſed of them, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he intended to ſhew ſome ſigne thereby, as he himſelf had deſired, ver. 17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And there roſe up fire out of the rock, and conſumed the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.] So ſoon as the Angel <hi>had touched</hi> theſe things with the end of his ſtaff, fire out of the rock conſumed them, notwithſtanding the broth was poured forth upon the rock, and the fleſh that was laid thereon, which was doubtleſſe enjoyned that the miracle might be the greater, as for the ſame cauſe Elijah poured water upon his ſacrifice, 1. Kings 18.33. and thus he made a kind of ſacrifice of that which Gideon brought for him to eat; and by cauſing fire to come miraculouſly out of the rock to conſume it, did both make known to Gideon who he was, and alſo might ſignifie, firſt, Gods acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance of that offering (for the miraculous burning of ſacrifices was an uſuall ſigne of Gods accepting them:) ſecondly, that God would accept of the ſervice which Gideon ſhould afterwards do him: thirdly, that it was as eaſie for the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his adverſaries, as to burn up that his offering. And beſides, we may look upon this as a ſweet repreſentation of our Evangelicall ſacrifices. The rock whereon our ſacrifices muſt be laid is Chriſt, and the Spirit which is as fire, from him derived to us, is that which muſt make our ſervices pure and holy, and fit to be offered to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:42229:69"/>Verſ. 22. <hi>Gideon ſaid, Alas, O Lord God! for becauſe I have ſeen an Angel of the Lord face to face.]</hi> It ſeems that in thoſe dayes they apprehended that the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Angel of God was very perillous for the life of a man: for thus alſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah was affrighted upon the ſame occaſion, chap. 13.22. <hi>And Manoah ſaid unto his wife, We ſhall ſurely die becauſe we have ſeen God.</hi> Gideon therefore perceiving now that it was an Angel, partly by the miraculous and ſudden burning up of the proviſion he had brought forth, with fire that came out of the rock; but eſpecially, by the ſudden vaniſhing of the Angel out of his ſight, he was ſo far over-born with fear, that he could ſcarce think he ſhould live, notwithſtanding the Angel himſelf had immediately before told him, that he ſhould ſmite the Midianites as one man. And thus by this grievous affrightment, he that ere-while was ſaluted by the Angel as <hi>a mighty man of valour,</hi> was taught what the moſt valiant men are if they be but a little left to themſelves, and not ſupported by God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Peace be unto thee, fear not, thou ſhalt not die.]</hi> It is ſaid before, ver. 21. that <hi>the Angel departed out of his ſight;</hi> this therefore he ſpake unto him out of the aire immediately after his vaniſhing away; or elſe, the meaning may be, that he ſaid this to him the next night: for ſo long his fear might well continue, and therefore it is happely ſaid, verſ. 15. that <hi>the ſame night the Lord ſaid unto him, Take thy fathers young bullock,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the ſame night wherein he had comforted him againſt this his fear.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord.]</hi> That is, in the place where this ſigne had been wrought, it was therefore the ſame altar mentioned verſ. 26. for that was built upon the top of this rock; onely here it is generally ſet down (as it is uſually in the Scriptures) and afterward the warrant he had from God, and the manner how he did it, is expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And it came to paſſe the ſame night that the Lord ſaid unto him,</hi> &amp;c.] In this and the following verſe we have the relation of the Lords appearing to Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecond time, and the directions he gave him for ſome things he was to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he undertook the deliverance of the people from the oppreſſion of the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites: But whether this were by a viſible apparition of an angel as the former was, or onely in a dream, it is not expreſſed, onely it is ſaid that it was in the night, (which may make it probable that it was in a dream, or nightly viſion) yea, <hi>the ſame night,</hi> that is, either the ſame night wherein the Angel had comforted him, as before-ſaid, verſ. 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Peace be unto thee, fear not, thou ſhalt not die:</hi> or rather the ſame night after the Angel of the Lord appeared to him, of which the ſtory hath hitherto ſpoken. The firſt direction given him may be diverſly read, to wit, <hi>Take thy fathers young bullock, and the ſecond bullock of ſeven years old</hi> (for ſo it is in the margin of our Bibles) or, <hi>Take thy fathers young bullock, even the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond bullock of ſeven years old.</hi> If we reade it as it is in the margin, then it is evident that there were two bullocks that Gideon was commanded to ſeize upon, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe both were to be ſacrificed, though there be expreſſe mention made of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing but one of them, verſ. 26. Onely it is then queſtionable, whether the words were intended to imply, that one of them onely was his fathers, and the other happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the peoples, known by the name of <hi>the ſecond bullock,</hi> and provided for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice, to be offered as a ſacrifice to Baal; or to imply onely the difference of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42229:69"/>
their age (both being his fathers) the one his <hi>young bullock,</hi> the other <hi>the ſecond bullock, of ſeven years old.</hi> But now if we reade it as it is in our Bibles, <hi>Take thy fathers young bullock, even the ſecond bullock of ſeven years old,</hi> then there was but one bullock he was to ſeize upon, to wit, his fathers young bullock, even the ſecond bullock of ſeven years old; which ſeems moſt probable, becauſe there is afterwards no mention made of the ſacrificing any other but one bullock, to wit, <hi>the ſecond bullock of ſeven years old;</hi> but why was this called <hi>the ſecond bullock?</hi> I anſwer, it might be ſo called in diverſe reſpects, as becauſe it was the ſecond in their order of ſtanding in the ſtall, or of their drawing in the plow or wain, or becauſe it was the ſecond in regard of age or worth, or becauſe it was the ſecond in order of thoſe that were prepared and ſet apart for Baals ſacrifice; and indeed this laſt ſeems to me the moſt probable, for though there be nothing in the text whereby we can certainly conclude for which of theſe reaſons it was called <hi>the ſecond bullock,</hi> yet becauſe it is evident that this bullock was devoted to Baals ſervice (for verſ. 28. we ſee the inhabitants of Ophrah reckoned this as a main part of Gideons ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Behold the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, &amp; the ſecond bullock was offered upon the altar that was built</hi>) we may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think that in reſpect of ſomething that concerned Baals ſacrifice it was called <hi>the ſecond bullock;</hi> and that this bullock was choſen by the Lord rather then another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſeven years old, and hereby might ſignifie that the Midianites tyranny which had laſted ſeven years ſhould now have an end, together with the ſuppreſſing of Baals worſhip in the land.</p>

                     <hi>And throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it.]</hi> This is the ſecond direction that is given here to Gideon, to wit, that he ſhould throw down Baals altar, and cut down the grove by it. That all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Ophrah had an intereſt in this altar and grove we may ſee by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation with Gideons father about it, verſ. 30. <hi>Then the men of the city ſaid unto Joaſh, Bring out thy ſonne that he may die, becauſe he hath caſt down the altar of Baal, and becauſe he hath cut down the grove that was by it.</hi> It ſeems therefore that Joaſh Gideons father as being the chief magiſtrate of that place had built this altar at his own expence, and upon his own ground (though not for his uſe onely, but for the publick uſe of all the inhabitants of Ophrah) and that therefore the Lord calls it here his fathers altar. However obſervable it is: firſt, that ere Gideon might go to fight againſt the Midianites the enemies of God and his people, he was enjoyned to ſet on foot the reformation of Religion, and the extirpation of ſuperſtition and idolatry, which had provoked the Lord to diſpleaſure againſt them, thereby as it were to make way for a happy victory: ſecondly, that he was enjoyned to begin this work of reformation, in the throwing down of his fathers altar, &amp;c. <hi>Take thy fathers young bullock, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath,</hi> the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by teaching him, that he that would reform publick abuſes muſt begin with his own family and friends, and that in yielding obedience to God he might not fear to offend his father, or any other that was deareſt to him; and that his affection to his father ſhould make him moſt carefull to winne him from every way of falſe worſhip:third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that before that charge is given him which followeth in the next verſe, concerning his building an altar to the Lord, he is firſt here appointed to throw down Baals al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42229:70"/>
Gods altar and Baals, the Ark and Dagon cannot ſtand together, the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God will not be accepted of God, where Baals altars are not firſt thrown down.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock in the ordered place.]</hi> Or as it is in the margin, <hi>in an orderly manner.</hi> This is the third direction given to Gideon, that when he had thrown down Baals altar, and cut down the grove, he muſt build an altar unto the Lord in that very place upon the top of the rock, whereat the Angel firſt appearing to him, the Lord had given him a ſigne, by cauſing fire to come out of that rock to conſume the proviſion that was laid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, brought forth for the Angel. Here therefore we have the command for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the altar, the building whereof is related before; and that place was no doubt purpoſely choſen for the building of this new altar, to ſignifie that it was built to the honour of that God who had there appeared to him; and that both by way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe for the mercy there promiſed, and by way of imploring the accompliſhing of that promiſe in the deliverance of his people from the oppreſſion of the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites. As for the laſt words, if we reade them as they are in the margin, <hi>in an orderly manner,</hi> then the meaning may be, either that he was to build the altar of earth and unhewen ſtones, as was ordered in the Law of Moſes, Exod. 20.24, 25. or elſe, that he was to build it in ſuch a manner, that it might be convenient for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that was to be done upon it, the laying of the wood in order upon it, and then the burning of the ſacrifice thereon. But if we reade it as it is in our text, <hi>in the ordered place,</hi> then thereby I conceive is onely meant, that the altar was to be built in that very place of the rock, which was before ordered to be the place whereon the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be laid, that Gideon had brought out for the Angel, verſ. 20. and which was choſen as being plain, and fit for this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And take the ſecond bullock, and offer a burnt ſacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou ſhalt cut down.]</hi> It was not lawfull for any but the prieſt to offer ſacrifice, or to build any altar, or to offer ſacrifice any where but onely in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; but here Gods ſpeciall command was a ſufficient warrant for Gideon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Then Gideon took ten men of his ſervants, and did as the Lord had ſaid unto him.]</hi> He took ſo many of his ſervants, that it might be the more ſpeedily diſpatched, becauſe it was to be done before morning; and obſervable it is, that Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon, being a man that feared God even in thoſe corrupt times, had ten ſervants that were ready to joyn with him in ſuppreſſing the idolatry of Baal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſo it was, becauſe he feared his fathers houſhold,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, becauſe he feared them leſt they ſhould hinder him in that he had to do. He was not affraid of any evil that they could do to him, for he might well know that it would be known who had done it, and this would prove as dangerous for him, as if he had been taken in the doing of it; but which he feared was, leſt he ſhould be interrupted by them, and kept from doing what God had charged him to do. So that it is the wiſdome and prudence of Gideon, that is here commended that taking the advantage of the night and ſetting as many hands together at work as he could, no body knew any thing of it to make head againſt him, ere the work was done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>They ſaid, Gideon the ſonne of Joaſh hath done this thing.]</hi> He might ſoon be ſuſpected, becauſe he was known to be no friend of Baal; but many other wayes alſo it might be diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:42229:70"/>Verſ. 30. <hi>Then the men of the city ſaid unto Joaſh, Bring out thy ſonne that he may die,</hi> &amp;c.] Herein was diſcovered the violent rage wherewith they were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their zeal for Baal. Joaſh it ſeems was either their chief Magiſtrate, or at leaſt a man of chief note and eſteem amongſt them, and well they might think that it would go much againſt him to deliver up his ſon to ſuch an enraged multitude; but ſo far were they tranſported with fury when they ſaw the altar of their idol-god thrown down, that they regarded Joaſh no more now then another man; nor will they ſtand to examine the cauſe, nor to heare what Gideon can ſay for himſelf, he had pulled down Baals altar and therefore he muſt ſuffer for it, yea the father muſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own ſonne to death; this they demanded peremptorily, and nothing elſe would ſerve their turn, wherein we ſee how God tryed the faith of Gideon, in this firſt act of his obedience to Gods command.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And Joaſh ſaid unto all that stood againſt him, Will ye plead for Baal?</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems that Joaſh had hitherto himſelf been a worſhiper of Baal: either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did now extraordinarily change his mind, and move him thus to plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Baal; or elſe Gideon had acquainted his father with the viſion he had ſeen, and ſo wonne him to approve of his fact, and to deſire the ſuppreſſing of that idol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which formerly himſelf had practiſed; or elſe, being a man indifferent for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, he ſayes this to ſave his ſonne, not being very zealous for his idol-god, as pretending it a wrong to plead for Baal, as if he could not plead for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, ſaying, Let Baal plead against him,</hi> &amp;c.] As it were in memorie of this fact, and to teſtifie his reſolution to defend him in it. For Jerubbaal is by interpretation, <hi>Let Baal plead for himſelf.</hi> In 2. Sam. 11.21. he is called Jerubbeſheth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>Then all the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and the children of the East were gathered together and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.]</hi> That is, they came over Jordan: (for they came out of the eaſt) <hi>and pitched in the valley of Jezreel,</hi> which was in the tribe of Manaſſeh, Joſh. 17.16. <hi>And the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Joſeph ſaid, The hill is not enough for us; and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley, have chariots of iron, both they which are of Bethſhean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel,</hi> and borders upon Iſſachar, Joſh. 19.18. and not farre therefore from Ophrah, where Gideon was: there was another Jezreel in the tribe of Judah, Joſh. 15.56. But the city which gave the name to this valley, was in the tribe of Manaſſeh, where the kings of Iſrael had a ſtately pallace, 1. Kings 21.1. <hi>And it came to paſſe after theſe things, that Naboth the Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel, hard by the pallace of Ahab king of Samaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon.]</hi> That is, God by his Spirit did work upon him in an unuſuall manner, by ſtirring up in him a zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to go againſt the Midianites, and furniſhed him with all gifts requiſite for the ſervice he had called him to; and becauſe happely his carriage of himſelf in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was ſuch, that every one might plainly ſee, that it was a Spirit above that of mans that carried him on in this work; therefore is it, that in the Hebrew the word <hi>is clothed. But the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he blew a trumpet, and Abiezer was gathered after him.]</hi> That is, his own
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42229:71"/>
family the Abiezrites, who now ſaw their folly in oppoſing him in Baals behalf; or if not ſo, were at leaſt in their neceſſity glad to cleave to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And he ſent meſſengers throughout all Manaſſeh,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, both thoſe within and thoſe without Jordan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſent meſſengers unto Aſher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.]</hi> The meaning is, that he ſent meſſengers to all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring tribes, except Ephraim, (which occaſioned that quarrell related afterwards in the eight chapter) and ſo from all theſe tribes there came many in to Gideon; for that is the meaning of the laſt clauſe, <hi>And they came up to meet them,</hi> that is, from theſe tribes there came many to meet and to joyn themſelves with thoſe forces he had already gathered.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>Behold, I will put a fleece of wooll on the floore,</hi> &amp;c.] See the former note, verſ. 13. No doubt Gideon had reſpect in theſe two following ſignes which he deſired, onely to be aſſured of Gods will concerning the event of his fighting with the Midianites, and happely thereby to encourage his followers and ſouldiers whom he gathered together: yet herein alſo we have a ſweet reſemblance of Gods dealing with the Jews firſt, and afterward with the Gentiles; the doctrine of ſalvation and ſpirit of grace are often in the Scripture compared to a dew, diſtilling down from heaven, Deut. 32.2. <hi>My doctrine ſhall drop as the rain: my ſpeech ſhall diſtill as the dew, as the ſmall rain upon the tender herb, and as the ſhowers upon the graſſe.</hi> Hoſ. 14.5. <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael: he ſhall grow as the lillie, and caſt forth his roots as Lebanon.</hi> A long time the Jews were filled with this dew, whilſt all the nations of the earth beſides were dry and barren, Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his word unto Jacob, his Statutes and judgements unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any nation: and as for his judgements, they have not known them.</hi> But now ſince Chriſts coming, this fleece, the people of the Jews are become dry, whilſt all nations of the earth about them, are continually watered with this dew of grace: Pſal. 107.33, 34, 25. <hi>He turneth rivers into a wilderneſſe: and the water ſprings into dry ground: A fruitfull land into barrenneſſe, for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein. He turneth the wilderneſſe into a ſtanding water: and dry ground into water ſprings.</hi> Eſa. 35.6, 7. <hi>Then ſhall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumbe ſing: for in the wilderneſſe ſhall waters break out, and ſtreams in the deſert:</hi> Eſa. 43.19, 20. <hi>Behold I will do a new thing: now it ſhall spring forth, Shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderneſſe, and rivers in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen Jerubbaal (who is Gideon) and all the people that were with him, roſe up early, and pitched beſide the well of Harod.]</hi> Which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>fear;</hi> probable it is therefore that it was ſo called from the fear of thoſe cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Iſraelites which here forſook their Captain and brethren.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>The people that are with thee, are too many for me to give the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites into their hands, leſt Iſrael vaunt themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] The whole army that Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42229:71"/>
had gathered when they were all together, was but two and thirty thouſand, and the Midianites on the other ſide were at leaſt a hundred thirty and five thouſand; for there were an hundred and twenty thouſand of them ſlain in the firſt overthrow, and the remainder that were left with Zebah and Zalmunna were fifteen thouſand, chap. 8.10. So that the Midianites were above foure times ſo many as the Iſraelites when Gideon had his whole army together. Now conſidering, firſt this great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion that was already betwixt the forces of Gideon, and the hoſt of the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites: and ſecondly, how unexpectedly the Lord had raiſed the ſpirit of Gideon to undertake this attempt, and made the people ſo willing to follow him, that ere while had hid themſelves in caves and dennes of the earth, chap. 6.2. and thirdly, that God had beforehand told Gideon that he would deliver the Midianites into their hands, and confirmed his promiſe with many miraculous ſignes; I ſay, conſidering theſe things, one would have thought, that had the Iſraelites vanquiſhed the Midianites with theſe two and thirty thouſand that were now come in to Gideon, they would never have attributed their victory to themſelves, and robbed God of his glory. But the Lord knew well how prone men are upon any ſucceſſe in this kind to vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to forget God; and therefore being very tender of his glory this way, he would not let the Iſraelites be ſo many as they were, but would have them brought to a handfull of three hundred men, that they might be the more abundantly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that their victory was merely of God, and not of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Whoſoever is fearfull and afraid, let him depart early from mount Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad.]</hi> That the Iſraelites ſhould make ſuch a proclamation as this when they were to go out to battell, God had formerly enjoyned in his Law, Deut. 20.8. Concerning which, ſee the the note in that place. Now for the mount Gilead from which they were now to depart, becauſe that mount Gilead which is ſo frequently mentioned in the Scripture, was without Jordan, and Gideon and his army were now within Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, chap. 6. it muſt needs be yielded that this mount Gilead here ſpoken of, was another mount of the ſame name in the tribe of Manaſſeh within Jordan, near the valley of Jezreel where the Midianites now lay: which is probable enough conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that we may well think, that a great many of this half of Manaſſeh within Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan were alſo deſcended from Gilead the ſonne of Machir the ſonne of Manaſſeh, and night therefore call this mountain <hi>Gilead,</hi> either in remembrance of their father, or elſe, as a witneſſe that though they were parted from their brethren by Jordan, yet they were of the ſame tribe with thoſe of their brethren the Manaſſites that inhabited mount Gilead without Jordan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there returned of the people twenty and two thouſand, and there remained ten thouſand.]</hi> For though they had before of their own accord, as volunteirs, coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly proffered their ſervices againſt the Midianites, yet now when they came to ſee the power and ſtrength of the enemy, their hearts began to fail them, and thereupon they ſoon imbraced this liberty given them to depart away.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>The people are yet too many: bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there.]</hi> That is, I will diſcover who they be that are indeed fit for this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him ſhalt thou ſet by himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, every one that takes up water in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42229:72"/>
palm of his hand, and ſo laps it up. Thoſe that were to be diſmiſſed were ſuch as kneeling down upon their knees, bowed their heads down to the river, and ſo put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their mouthes into the water drunk and ſucked up their fill; the other ſort that were to be retained were ſuch, as onely bending their bodies a little, did with their hands ſnatch up a little water for the refreſhing of themſelves, and ſo lapping it up, went away. And theſe are ſaid to lappe as a dog lappeth, becauſe this kind of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a ſnatching manner, without thruſting their mouths into the water as horſes and other cattell do, is moſt like the lapping of dogs, who put not their mouths into the water, but ſnatch it up with their tongues, nor drink ſo ſoakingly as other cattell, eſpecially when they are hunting, but onely lappe a little and make haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently away: and why were theſe choſen and the other ſent away? becauſe that other kind of drinking argued weakneſſe and faintneſſe, ſloth, and a greedy deſire of filling themſelves, as men impatient of the thirſt they had indured; this on the other ſide ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued ſtrength and abilitie of body, and that they were content with a little refreſhing, more minding the buſineſſe they had in hand then the filling themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7 <hi>By the three hundred men that lapped, will I ſave you,</hi> &amp;c.] Whereas of the enemy there were at leaſt a hundred thirty five thouſand, chap. 8.10. ſo that for every ſouldier Gideon had left, there were foure hundred and fifty of his enemies: and in this poore remainder of Gideons troups which he brought, we ſee a ſhadow of that Chriſt ſaith, Matt. 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>So the people took victualls in their hands, and their trumpets.]</hi> That is, the trumpets of the whole army, even thoſe that were diſmiſſed; for amongſt thirty two thouſand, there might well be three hundred trumpets.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And it came to paſſe the ſame night the Lord ſaid unto him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the ſame night after he had diſmiſſed all his ſouldiers, ſave onely thoſe three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men that lapped the water; ſo that it ſeems, this alſo the Lord revealed to him in a nightly viſion or dream. The like is noted before in the foregoing chapter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy ſervant down to the host.]</hi> That is, if thou feareſt to go down and ſet upon the enemy, becauſe thy army is reduced to ſo ſmall a number, then go firſt with thy ſervant privately to their army, and there thou ſhalt hear what ſhall further ſtregthen thy faith.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and all the children of the eaſt, lay along in the valley, like graſſehoppers for multitude.]</hi> There is expreſſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a hundred thirty five thouſand of them, chap. 8.10. <hi>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hoſt with them, about fifteen thouſand men, all that were left of the children of the eaſt: for there fell a hundred twenty thouſand men that drew ſword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian,</hi> &amp;c.] The analogy betwixt Gideon and this barley cake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly in this, that being a man comparatively baſe and of no eſteem, nor likely in the eye of reaſon, with thoſe poore weak troops, which he had ſo ſuddenly ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, to ruine the whole army of the Midianites (no more then that the fall of a barly cake ſhould overthrow one of their ſtrongeſt and goodlieſt tents) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likely to be devoured by them, ſo ſoon as ever he ſhould ſhow himſelf amongſt them, even to be eaten up by them, <hi>as men eat bread,</hi> Pſalm 14.4. he ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42229:72"/>
utterly ruine and overthrow that huge army of the Midianites, and lay their pomp and glory in the duſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And it was ſo, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worſhiped,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he bowed himſelf to God by way of thankfullneſſe for bringing him to hear this for the ſtrengthening of his faith: for firſt, hereby it was manifeſt that God had already ſtricken them with a fear of him &amp; thoſe forces which he had raiſed againſt them: and ſecondly, he might plainly ſee that Gods hand was in this buſineſſe to comfort and encourage him, that juſt at this time one of the ſouldiers ſhould be telling this dream, and another of his fellows ſhould in this manner expound it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And ſay, The ſword of the Lord, and of Gideon.]</hi> Thus was Gideon carefull in the firſt place to aſcribe all their ſucceſſe to the Lord, acknowledging thereby that Gideons ſword would have been of no power to vanquiſh their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if the Lord ſhould not fight for them, and cauſe the ſword of Gideon to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious; but yet withall he appointed them to joyn his name with the Lords, <hi>the ſword of the Lord, and of Gideon,</hi> becauſe he perceived by that which he heard in the camp of the Midianites, that the Lord had made his name terrible amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>So Gideon and the three hundred men that were with him, came to the outſide of the camp, in the beginning of the middle watch.]</hi> If the Hebrews in theſe times did (as ſome conceive) divide the night into three watches, the meaning of the words is plain, that this was done in the beginning of the ſecond watch; but it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that in future times they had foure watches, allowing three hours to every watch, Matt. 14.25. <hi>And in the fourth watch of the night, Jeſus went unto them walking on the ſea.</hi> If it were ſo now alſo, the meaning muſt be, that Gideon came upon them in the beginning of the third watch, which is called the middle watch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it begun about midnight; but I ſhould rather think that they had not four watches, till they came to be under the Romane government, and ſo followed their cuſtome in the ordering of their night-watches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands,</hi> &amp;c.] Beſides the terrour of the ſuddenneſſe of ſeeing ſo many lights burning about them, and of hearing ſo many pitchers broken, ſo many trumpets ſounding, and ſo many men crying out, <hi>the ſword of the Lord, and of Gideon,</hi> &amp; that in the dead of the night when they lay ſleeping ſecurely, the firſt thoughts which adviſed reaſon could ſuggeſt muſt needs be, that it could not but be a mighty army that had ſo many trumpets and lights attending them, and hence it was, that the Midianites <hi>ran and cryed and fled,</hi> verſ. 21. Yea beſides, we may well think this was the rather appointed that herein we might have a ſweet type of the ſpirituall conqueſt of Satan by Chriſt and his elect. For how did Chriſt vanquiſh hell and death, but 1. by being broken for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our ſinnes, Heb. 2.14. <hi>For as much therefore as the children are pertakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil:</hi> and 2. by his reſurrection, wherein the ſplendour of his divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did ſhine forth moſt gloriouſly, Rom. 1.4. and 8.34. And how do the Saints pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but 1. by the preaching, and the free profeſſion of the Goſpell, <hi>the treaſure we have in earthen veſſels,</hi> 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themſelves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah, and Jordan.]</hi> That is, the foords and paſſages of the river Jordan, even unto Beth-barah, or Bethabarah, John 1.28. or elſe, theſe waters unto Beth-barah, were ſome other rivers they were to paſſe over, ere they came to Jordan, and therefore diſtinguiſhed from them; and indeed, by this means many of the Midianites did they here intercept, and amongſt the reſt, two of their princes, Oreb, and Zeeb, and the other that eſcaped over before the paſſages could be taken Gideon purſued; now hereby the Iſraelites might have ſeen the humble ſpirit of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon; namely, that he deſired not to ingroſſe the glory of the victory wholy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but was willing that his brethren ſhould have their ſhare in it too.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the men of Ephraim ſaid unto him, Why haſt thou ſerved us thus,</hi> &amp;c.] See the laſt note of the foregoing chapter. As afterwards they quarrelled with Jephthah, chap. 12.1. <hi>And the men of Ephraim gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, and went northward, and ſaid unto Jephthah, Wherefore paſſedſt thou over to fight againſt the children of Ammon, and didſt not call us to go with thee.</hi> So here now they contended with Gideon. Jacob had given this tribe of Ephraim the preheminence above that of Manaſſeh, which might happely make them the more impatient of this diſhonour which was now done them as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the leſſe able to brook that the Manaſſices, of whom Gideon was, ſhould become ſo renowned for this victorious exploit of theirs againſt the Midianites. But however being puffed up, partly with the potency of their tribe, and partly with the preheminence they had above the other tribes, in that the Tabernacle was ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, to wit, in Shilo, which was one of their cities; but eſpecially with their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42229:73"/>
good ſucceſſe in that late ſervice they were called to of taking the paſſages of Jordan, where the flying Midianites were to paſſe over, when they came to Gideon with the heads of Oreb and Zeeb, they quarrelled with him, becauſe they were not called out, as well as ſome other of the tribes, when he firſt raiſed forces to go againſt the Midianites, pretending it to be a great diſregard, yea, contempt of them, that other tribes that were not ſo nearly allyed to them as they were (both theſe tribes being of Joſephs poſterity) ſhould be called in by Gideon and his Manaſſites to the firſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, which was the greateſt exploit; and they onely left to ſnatch up here and there ſome of the flying Midianites, after others had routed them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better then the vintage of Abiezer?]</hi> Becauſe the men of Ephraim quarrelled againſt Gideon, who was of the family of Abiezer, was chiefly from this, that they looked upon the ſervice which they were called too, in taking the paſſages of Jordan from the flying Midianites, as ſo poore and mean a buſineſſe in compariſon of that which Gideon, and his Manaſſites had done, (Gideon and his ſouldiers had hewen down the great army of the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and then they were called in to gather up the chips; or Gideon had gathered in the vintage, and then they were called in to come and gather up their gleanings) therefore doth Gideon anſwer them thus, <hi>Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better then the vintage of Abiezer?</hi> as if he had ſaid, Suppoſe it be ſo as you conceive, ſurely conſidering that you have had the killing and pillaging of ſuch multitudes of them, and eſpecially, that you have taken and ſlain two of their kings; you muſt needs yield that your gleanings (if they be but gleanings) are better then our vintage; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gideon could not have ſaid this ſo well after he and his three hundred men had ſlain Zebah and Zalmunna, the other two princes of the Midianites, therefore it is probably thought by ſome, that this expoſtulation of the Ephramites with Gideon, was before he had diſcomfited thoſe princes of Midian, though it was after he was gone over Jordan, as is expreſſely noted in the laſt verſe of the foregoing chapter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And Gideon came to Jordan and paſſed over,</hi> &amp;c.] This was before the men of Ephraims contending with him, though here it be mentioned after it. See the note chap. 7. verſ. 25.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And he ſaid unto the men of Succoth, Give I pray you, loaves of bread,</hi> &amp;c.] This was not that Succoth in Egypt, Exod. 12.37. whether the children of Iſrael removed from Rameſes, but a city in the tribe of Gad, Joſh. 13.27. which had it name from the boothes which Jacob made there, at his return out of Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia, Gen. 33.17. <hi>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an houſe, and made boothes for his cattell: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the princes of Succoth ſaid, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hands,</hi> &amp;c.] They ſaw that many, even fifteen thouſand, of the Midianites were eſcaped, verſ. 10. theſe they thought might ſoon ralley themſelves together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and become too ſtrong for Gideon and his three hundred wearied men, at leaſt they might eſcape, muſter new forces, and then entring the land again, might wreak their teene upon thoſe that ſhould afford Gideon any ſuccour now in this his neceſſity; and upon theſe grounds they reject his motion with ſcorn, as judging it moſt unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not impoſſible, that he ſhould wholly ſubdue the Midianites, and ſave the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites out of their hands.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And he went up thence to Penuel, and ſpake unto them likewiſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Which was a city in that very place where Jacob wreſtled with the Angel, Gen. 32.30. <hi>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.]</hi> It is moſt probable that Gideon in his treating with the men of Penuel, perceived that the confidence they had in a ſtrong tower which they had built, and in which they ſtood upon their guard, made them anſwer him with ſuch ſcorn and diſdain as they did, and that thereupon he threatned them, that at his return he would not onely deſtroy them, but break down their tower too.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ts,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, of the Arabians, who lay eaſtward of the Iſraelites; ſo that it ſeems Gideon fearing to be diſcovered if he had followed right on forward, fetched a compaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and came upon them on the eaſt ſide where they never feared any enemy, to wit, on the eaſt of Nobah and Jokbeah. Now Nobah was a city in the land of Manaſſeh, Num. 32.42. but happely in the confines of Gad; for Jokbeah was one of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Num. 32.25.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And he diſcribed unto him the Princes of Succoth.]</hi> That is, he gave him their names in writing, as the Hebrew word ſignifieth, happely withall telling him where they dwelt, and how they might be known and found. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gideon knew that the Magiſtrates onely were in fault that he was ſo ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully denyed a little refreſhing for his ſouldiers, therefore was he ſo carefull to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after theſe princes of Succoth, that ſo none might ſuffer but thoſe that were guiltie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And he took the Elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderneſſe, and briers, and with them be taught the men of Succoth.]</hi> In what manner they were torn with theſe thorns and briers it is not expreſſed; that they were ſlain, it is moſt probable, becauſe the men of Penuel were ſlain, verſ. 17. Some conceive that they were caſt out naked upon briers and thorns, and then that carts and wains were drawn over them, as they uſed in thoſe countries to beat out hard corn with a cart wheel, Eſa. 28.27. <hi>For the fitches are not threſhed with a threſhing inſtrument; neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin: but the fitches are beaten out with a staffe, and the cummin with a rod.</hi> Whence is that phraſe of turning the wheel over the wicked, Prov. 20.26. <hi>A wiſe king ſcattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them;</hi> which is, becauſe they thus reade this clauſe, <hi>with them he threſhed,</hi> or <hi>beat out the men of Succoth.</hi> But others conceive they were beaten or ſcourged to death with them, or at leaſt that they vvere beaten vvith theſe, and aftervvards vvere ſlain ſome other vvay. But hovvever, the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>with them he taught the men of Succoth,</hi> is, that thereby he taught them to know what it vvas to uſe him and their brethren as they had done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and ſlew the men of the city.]</hi> That is, the Magiſtrates of the city, as before he did in Succoth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Then ſaid he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye ſlew at Tabor.]</hi> Becauſe it ſeems Gideon had heard that theſe kings
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42229:74"/>
had ſlain certain men of the Iſraelites that had retired themſelves for ſhelter to ſome ſtrong holds or caves in mount Tabor, and feared they vvere his brethren, becauſe they amongſt others ſought to provide for the ſaving of their lives in thoſe dangerous times as others did, chap. 6.2. <hi>And the hand of Midian prevailed against Iſrael: and becauſe of the Midianites the children of Iſrael made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strong holds;</hi> and had not been ſince heard of, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he inquires thus concerning the men vvhom they had there ſlain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they anſwered, As thou art, ſo were they; each one reſembled the children of a king.]</hi> This may be meant of that likeneſſe of feature which is uſually amongſt brethren, but plainly it intends that they were of a goodly and comely perſonage, even as Gideon was, and ſuch as might well beſeem men of a princely and Royall ſtock.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>As the Lord liveth, if ye had ſaved them alive, I would not ſlay you.]</hi> The meaning is, that he would have ſpared them, becauſe they had ſhown mercy to his brethren; and hereby he expreſſeth his ſorrow for his brethren, and ſhews what little cauſe they had now to expect any mercy from him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And he ſaid unto Jether his first-born, Up and ſlay them.]</hi> Upon him he impoſeth this work rather then any other, firſt, that he might train him up, even from his young years, to draw his ſword againſt the enemies of Iſrael, and to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to thoſe that ſhould riſe up againſt God, and againſt his people: ſecondly, that it might be done by way of avenging the death of his brethren: thirdly, becauſe it would adde, if not to the pain, yet to the diſhonour of their death, to die by ſuch a hand</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Then Zebah and Zalmunna ſaid, Riſe thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, ſo is his ſtrength.]</hi> In this reply of theirs, firſt, they deſcant in a kind of ſcornfull manner upon that command of Gideons ſetting a child to take away their lives; whereas indeed, this his young heire had ſcarce courage enough to look them in the face: ſecondly, they provoke Gideon (as impatient of delay) to riſe upon them himſelf, and rid them out of the way, thereby diſcovering their contempt of death, and how much they ſcorned to begge life, and withall happely being loath to die by the hand of a child.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And took away the ornaments that were on their Camels necks.]</hi> As the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of this great victory.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Then the men of Iſrael ſaid unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy ſonne,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they offered to receive him to be their king, and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the kingdome ſucceſſively upon his poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And Gideon ſaid unto them, I will not rule over you,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, not as a king; he judged Iſrael unto his dying day, but it was the kingdome of Iſrael, the regall power, which they proffered, and he now refuſed, and that upon this ground, becauſe the accepting of this would have been in a manner a taking of the government out of Gods hand, <hi>the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall rule over you.</hi> Not that God rules not by kings, as well as by other kind of Magiſtrates; but becauſe God had eſtabliſhed this way of governing them by Judges, who had not ſo great a degree of ſoveraignty and power over the people, as kings uſually have, &amp; were extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily called of God; &amp; withall, becauſe God had in his Law expreſſed, that in caſe they ſhould deſire a king, they were to take him whom the Lord ſhould chooſe, Deu. 17.14, 15
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42229:75"/>
                     <hi>When thou art come to the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and ſhalt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe it, and ſhall dwell therein, and ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a king over me, like all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are about: Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him a king over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe. One from among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet over thee: thou mayest not ſet a ſtranger over thee which is not thy brother.</hi> Therefore he takes this raſh proffer of changing the government, to be a ſhaking of Gods government, becauſe they went about to change it without Gods leave, and refuſeth to give any conſent to it; all which is evident by that which the Lord ſaid of the Iſraelites deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a King in Samuels dayes, 1. Sam. 8.6, 7. <hi>But the thing diſpleaſed Samuel, when they ſaid, Give us a King to judge us: and Samuel prayed unto the Lord, And the Lord ſaid unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people, in all that they ſay unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reigne over them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And the weight of the golden ear-rings which he requested, was a thouſand and ſeven hundred ſhekles of gold,</hi> &amp;c.] Which is eſteemed to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the account of our weight, 2380 pounds; it is not impoſſible that all this ſhould be ſpent in the making of one ephod, as it is ſaid, verſ. 27. eſpecially if it were made as that of Aarons, with a breſtplate, ſet with ſo many precious ſtones of great value, Exod. 28.15, 16.17. But the words will well enough bear, that of part of this gold now given him, he made an ephod.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city.]</hi> Not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen ephod, but ſuch a one as that which was made for the high prieſt, of gold, blue, purple, ſcarlet, &amp;c. Exod. 28.6. It is probable enough that he intended it, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a memoriall of this their victory over the Midianites (the monument being of the very prey which was there taken) though afterwards it became a ſnare both to him and to his houſe. But why then did he make an ephod rather then any other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument? this indeed ſeems to imply, that his purpoſe was, to make uſe alſo of this ephod either in offering ſacrifices in his own houſe (and then under this ephod, all the prieſtly garments may be comprehended) or elſe, thereby to enquire what the will of the Lord was, according to the judgement of Urim. Not conſidering that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge was onely annexed to Aarons ephod, wherein was the breſtplate of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Urim and Thummim; and therein therefore he ſinned greatly, and brought Gods wrath upon his poſterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And all Iſrael went thither a whoring after it,</hi> &amp;c.] Either they went thither as to a famous Oracle, to inquire concerning the will of God in any doubtfull caſes, or elſe drawn with the ſuperſtitious conceits they had entertained of this ephod, they ſet up there a place of ſacrificing, contrary to the expreſſe letter of the Law of God; or elſe, they reſorted to it, as to an idol or holy relique, to fall down before it and worſhip it; or happely, they did at length make uſe of it, as a moſt holy veſtment, in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Baal; hovvever ſome vvay they abuſed it idolatrouſly, and are therefore ſaid to have gone a vvhoring after it. Concerning vvhich phraſe, ſee the note, chap. 2.17. and therefore too it is ſaid in the follovving vvords, that it <hi>became a ſnare unto Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to his houſe,</hi> that is, it inſnared his poſterity by degrees, dravving them to do that vvhich vvas moſt diſpleaſing to God, and at laſt plunging them deeper, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the utter ruine of his vvhole houſe.</p>

See chap. 3.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And his concubine that was in Shechem, ſhe alſo bare him a ſonne, whoſe name he called Abimelech.]</hi> Theſe words <hi>his concubine that was in She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> ſeems to imply, that there ſhe was bred and lived, and that there amongſt her friends ſhe choſe to live, even after Gideon had taken her to be his concubine (that is, his wife, though in an inferiour degree, as having been before his maidſervant, chap. 9.18.) and that happely, becauſe Gideon was wont to come up frequently to Shechem about matters of judgement, as Expoſitours conceive. Now of this concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine it is ſaid, that <hi>ſhe bare him a ſonne, whoſe name he called Abimelech.</hi> Abimelech ſignifieth <hi>my father is a king,</hi> or a <hi>kingly father;</hi> and it was the uſuall title of the Philiſtine kings; a fatall name it was, diſcovering ſome proud and ambitious thoughts in his mother, who it is likely moved her husband upon ſome other fair pretence to give him this name.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Abimelech the ſonne of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mothers brethren,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, his uncles by his mothers ſide. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gideons death <hi>the children of Iſrael turned again, and went a whoring after Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alim,</hi> as it is ſaid before, chap. 8.33. and therefore as in former times the Lord ſtill puniſhed their idolatry and apoſtacy from him, by ſome of the neighboring nations that invaded their land, and ſorely afflicted them, ſo now he puniſhed them by the tyranny of one of their own people, even by Abimelech, the ſonne of their late Judge Gideon, by a concubine which he kept in Shechem, who upon his fathers death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved immediatly to attempt the taking to himſelf that regall power which the people had lately offered to ſettle upon his father, and his poſterity ſucceſſively, but that he rejected it, chap. 8.22, 23. To make way thereto, he went preſently to She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, and there as it is here ſaid, he began to tamper firſt with his uncles, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brethren and the reſt of her kindred, and imployed them as his inſtruments, who happely were of good rank and eſteem in Shechem, to ſee if they could draw all the inhabitants of that city to aid him in this his project, not doubting but that if he could effect this, he ſhould be able well enough to accompliſh the reſt of his plot. And thus by the miſery which this ſonne of a concubine brought both upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe and the whole kingdome, we may ſee that God did even in thoſe times teſtifie his diſpleaſure againſt their having ſeverall wives and concubines, though he did not openly by his prophets conteſt with them about it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Whether is better for you, either that all the ſonnes of Jerubbaal (which are threeſcore and ten perſons) reigne over you, or that one reigne over you?]</hi> Theſe are the words which Abimelech put into the mouthes of his mothers kindred, whereby they were to perſwade the men of Shechem to make him king. Wherein firſt, he takes it for granted that though his father had in modeſty refuſed the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet it was fitting that now according to their proffer they ſhould ſettle it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his poſterity: and ſecondly, he labours to perſwade them that his brethren had a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42229:76"/>
plot upon the kingdome to divide it amongſt them; and therefore willed them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (as pretending the publick good, when he aimed onely at his own ambitious ends) whether they might not do better, to do what in them lay to ſettle him alone in the kingdome, then to ſuffer themſelves to be under the command of all Gideons ſonnes; eſpecially, conſidering there were ſo many of them, as there were. Indeed, we find not that any of Gideons ſonnes, had the leaſt thought of any ſuch thing; yea, Jotham in that parable of the fruit-trees refuſing the ſoveraignty over the trees, which follows in this chapter, did plainly enough imply that both himſelf and his brethren were content with the condition wherein they lived, and deſired not to reigne as kings; but whether this were ſo or no, it was all one to Abimelech; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the mind of others by his own, he might be jealous that they intended this; &amp; however if the poſſeſſing of the people with this conceit might further his project, that was all he cared for; onely, as ſlanderers are wont to do, he would not flatly and in downright terms ſay they had a plot upon the kingdome, but contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cunningly and cloſely to intimate ſo much; <hi>Whether</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is better for you, either that all the ſonnes of Jerubbaal (which are threeſcore and ten perſons) reigne over you, or that one reigne over you?</hi>

However when Abimelech had ſlain his brethren, the men of Shechem, and this houſe of Millo joyned together, and choſe and proclaimed him king of Iſrael, and happely annoynted him; for ſo ancient was the cuſtome of anointing kings, as Jotham in his parable doth plainly imply, verſ. 8. <hi>The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them.</hi> Manifeſt it is, that he was made king not of Shechem onely, but of all Iſrael in generall, verſ. 22. <hi>When Abimelech had reigned three years over Iſrael.</hi> Indeed it may ſeem ſtrange that the inhabitants of one city, ſhould dare to do this alone of themſelves, it being expreſſely too againſt the Law of God, Deut. 17.14, 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him king over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe;</hi> but the wonder of this may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by conſidering, firſt, that though the Shechemites be onely here mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were the ringleaders in this buſineſſe, yet it may be that many other Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites both of other towns and tribes did come in, moved by their example and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and joyned in the election of Abimelech: and ſecondly, that they well might hope to carry it, now his brethren were ſlain, though ſome ſhould oppoſe it, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his pretended title, to wit, that proffer of ſettling the kingdome upon Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons poſterity, chap. 8.22. <hi>Then the men of Iſrael ſaid unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy ſonne, and thy ſonnes ſonne alſo:</hi> and likewiſe, becauſe they might know that generally the people began to be weary of the government God had eſtabliſhed over them, and longed to be like other nations in having a king to reigne over them, as was manifeſt by the proffer they made to Gideon, and that which Jotham ſaith in his parable, verſ. 8. and if they would have a king, who ſo likely to be the man as Gideons ſonne? and thirdly, becauſe however by thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had ſuddenly raiſed, he was able to effect it by conſtraint.

                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And when they told it to Jotham, he went and ſtood in the top of mount Girizim,</hi> &amp;c.] The Lord intending to puniſh Abimelech, &amp; the Shechemites for their changing of the government which God had eſtabliſhed in Iſrael, and eſpecially for the bloudy murther committed upon the ſonnes of Gideon, it ſeems by a ſpeciall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of his Spirit, he moved Jotham, who alone of the ſonnes of Gideon eſcaped the hands of Abimelech, to go to the inhabitants of Shechem, when the tydings was brought him that they had made Abimelech king, and to give them warning before hand of the calamities and judgements that were likely to befall them if they did not repent of this their wickednes; &amp; therefore it was, that he began his ſpeech with thoſe words, <hi>Hearken unto me you men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, both that God had ſent him with that meſſage to them, and that if they would not now hearken to the admonition that was given them, God would not hear them
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42229:77"/>
in the time of their diſtreſſe when they called upon him. As for mount Girizim, from the top whereof Jotham ſpake to the Shechemites, it ſeems it ſtood very cloſe upon Shechem, and was purpoſely choſen by Jotham as a place convenient, whence he might ſpeak in the audience of the inhabitants, at that time perhaps upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion aſſembled together, and likewiſe as a place of ſafety, whence he might preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fly and eſcape away if they ſhould offer to ſurpriſe him (for ſo it is ſaid he did, verſ. 21. <hi>And Jotham ran away and fled</hi>) but withall, it may ſeem to be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a myſtery, that Girizim the mountain whence the bleſſings were to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the tribes of Iſrael, Deut. 11.29. was choſen for this work rather then mount Ebal; for what a terrible token was this, that they were to expect no mercy from God, when from the mountain of bleſſings, they heard nothing but Gods curſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>The trees went out on a time to anoint a king over them,</hi> &amp;c.] The drift of Jotham in propounding this fable to the men o Shechem, was to ſhew, firſt, the folly of the Iſraelites in going about to change the government which God had eſtabliſhed amongſt them, out of a fond affectation of having a king to reigne over them: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the vain and cauſeleſſe pride and ambition of that tyrant Abimelech in exalting himſelf to be their king: and thirdly, the miſery that would certainly befall both the men of Shechem, and their new made king, for their caſting off Gods government, and their dealing ſo wickedly with the ſonnes of Gideon. So that firſt, by the trees that went to make them a king, he intended the Iſraelites in generall, that were fond to have a king reigne over them, but more particularly the men of Shechem that had actually made Abimelech king; ſecondly, by the olive tree, fig tree, and vine, that are good, noble, and uſefull trees that yield yearly ſweet and pleaſant fruit, and that refuſed to accept of being king over the trees, may be meant not onely Gideon who had refuſed the kingdome when the Iſraelites proffered it to him and his poſterity ſucceſſively, chap. 8.22, 23. but alſo the foregoing Judges, Ehud, and Deborah, and happely too the other ſonnes of Gideon (for though we reade not that they refuſed the kingdome, or had it ever proffered to them; yet it was ſufficient that they were content to be ſerviceable to God and man in their places, and deſired not this ſovereigne power; and fables need not anſwer in every particular, that which they are intended to ſhadow forth) and generally indeed all men of worth, good men and fearing God, that are content to do good in their places, and no way ambitious of being exalted to high places: and laſtly, by the bramble, that is a dry, fruitleſſe, baſe ſhrub, the curſe of the earth, good for nothing but to be caſt into the fire, may be meant all worthleſſe ambitious perſons, but Abimelech in particular, who grew out of the baſer hedgegrow of a concubine, and had not been able to lift up his head ſo high as he did, but that he was ſupported by the men of Shechem, and by their help ſcrambled up to be king of Iſrael, one that was alwayes as fruitleſſe, as baſe, that had no ſubſtance in him, nor was likely to yield any comfort to thoſe that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in him, but rather to vex, and to tear, and to fetch bloud from the people by his tyrannous government, as he had done already from his brethren the other ſonnes of Gideon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>But the olive tree ſaid unto them, Should I leave my fatneſſe, wherewith by me they honour God and man,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, God in his offerings, lamps, and

other ſervices of the Tabernacle; and man, both in anointing men to be kings, prieſts, and Prophets, and likewiſe in many other civill uſes, wherein great, and rich, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſons were wont to refreſh themſelves with oyl, eſpecially in oderife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous coſtly ointments. Now in this paſſage of this fable (and the like muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the anſwer returned by the figtree and vine too) Jotham ſeeks to imply, not onely that good men and men of worth are beſt contented to be ſervicable to God and man in their places, and deſire not to be exalted to places of magiſtracy, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over others, (as they had ſeen in Gideons refuſing to be king) and likewiſe the reaſons why as Gideon had, ſo other wiſe and good men, would refuſe thus to be promoted, namely, firſt, becauſe the place of ſoveraignty, though it might ſeem moſt glorious, yet would certainly bring them greater cares, and deprive them of much of thoſe comforts, which in their private condition they did formerly enjoy: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe ſuch great promotion, doth uſually make vines and fig trees, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live trees fruitleſſe and barren, that is, it makes them farre leſſe ſerviceable to God, and man, then formerly they were.</p>

He that thruſts himſelf under a bramble ſhall be in an ill caſe, not able to ſtirre hand or foot, but he is in danger to be torn and ſcratched; and ſuch is the miſery of thoſe that live under a tyrants govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhall not live as free ſubjects, but ſhall ever and anon be in danger to have their clothes torn from their backs, yea their skinnes from their bones, and if the greateſt of them anger their lord never ſo little, nothing but fire and deſtruction is to be expected; and therefore is that clauſe added, <hi>Let fire come out of the bramble and devoure the Ceders of Lebanon,</hi> that is, the nobles and men of greateſt renown amongſt the people, as indeed tyrants are wont principally to ſeek the deſtruction of them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the houſe of Millo, and devoure Abimelech.]</hi> This was accompliſhed, when his ſcull was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a piece of a milſtone thrown down upon his head by a woman from the tower of Thebez, verſ. 50.53. (for Thebez was doubtleſſe a place of ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Shechemites (why elſe did Abimelech in the quarrell he had againſt the Shechemites, go up and encamp againſt Thebez?) and ſo loſing his life by means of the warre raiſed betwixt him and the Shechemites, it might well be ſaid that a fire that came out from them devoured Abimelech.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be that city in the tribe of Simeon which is called Baalath-Beer, Joſh. 19.8. where he ſaved himſelf, either by living there unknown, or by the aid of the inhabitants, who perhaps with other cities had not yet ſtooped to the tyrannous yoke of Abimelech.</p>

For in this regard, though the wickedneſſe of theſe things were wholly of themſelves and not of God (as the ſtink of the dunghill riſeth not from the ſunne, though the ſunne ſhining upon it be the occaſion of it) yet becauſe theſe things were alſo through the concurring providence of God, it may well be ſaid that God ſent this ſpirit of diviſion between them, eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that God did all this as a judge, raiſing theſe diviſions and combuſtions that hereby he might puniſh them for their former damnable agreeing together for the ruine of others, and ſo making their treachery one againſt another, the juſt reward of their joynt treachery againſt others, as it follows in the next words, <hi>And the men of Shechem dealt treacherouſly with Abimelech,</hi> that is, they revolted from him whom themſelves had choſen for their king</p>

But what is that to give him a title to the kingdome which his father refuſed? or why might not the other ſonnes of Gideon whom he ſlew, have challenged the crown more juſtly then he? And beſides, the very name of Jerubbaal may put you in mind what an enemy he was to Baal, the God whom with one conſent we worſhip and ſerve, and what cauſe have you then to ſerve his ſonne? Beſides, you do not indeed ſerve him but his man Zebul, for that is implyed in thoſe words, <hi>and Zebul his officer,</hi> ſo that of a free city you are plunged into a miſerable ſlavery, made to ſtoop to every domineering officer, whom this ſonne of a concubine ſhall ſet over you: and thus by this particular glance at Zebul, (which implyes their folly in putting any confidence in him who was Abimelechs ſworn ſervant) he no doubt laboured to wring him out of the peoples favour, that he might wind himſelf into that place which he held, of being governour over the city.</p>

Some conceive that Gaal here pretends, at leaſt that he and his brethren were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of Hamor the ancient lord of Shechem, and ſo thereupon perſwades them, that if they would have a lord to govern them, they ſhould rather chuſe him or ſome of his family. But firſt, it is altogether improbable, that Gaal and his brethren were of that curſed race of the Canaanites; and ſecondly, if he were, it is no way likely that he could hope that they would admit of one of thoſe nations whom they had driven out of their poſſeſſions, to rule over them. It is therefore farre more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that Gaal ſpake this by way of deriding the ſoveraignty of Abimelech, <hi>Serve</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the men of Hamor the father of Shechem, for why ſhould we ſerve him?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, if you long to give away your liberty and to be in bondage, you ſhall do better to call in the old lords of this ſoyl, and to ſerve them, then to ſerve this upſtart Abimelech, in whom there is nothing worth the leaſt reſpect.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And when Zebul the ruler of the citie heard the words of Gaal,</hi> &amp;c.] It is evident that Zebul did either truly adhere to the Shechemites in this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt Abimelech, or elſe made a ſhew to them that he did: for elſe no doubt they would not have truſted him ſo farre as they had done. If therefore he were truly on their ſide before, it may ſeem that Gaals ſcornfull ſpeeches againſt him, verſ. 28. <hi>Is not he the ſonne of Jerubbaal, and Zebul his officer?</hi> (which alſo diſcovered a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that he had to ſupplant him, and to get into his place) had now enraged him, and ſo cauſed him by giving ſecret intelligence to Abimelech, to ſeek to betray them into his hands.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>Then ſaid Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou ſaidst, Who is Abimelech,</hi> &amp;c.] When he ſaw that Gaal had plainly diſcovered Abimelechs troops, that he might not turn back again into the city, he endeauours by theſe ſcornfull taunts to provoke him to go forward to fight with him, <hi>where is thy mouth,</hi> that is, where is thy great brags, for ſhame turn not back, but let it be ſeen that thou canſt fight as well as talk bigly when no enemy was nigh.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech.]</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42229:79"/>
Zebuls taunts had made him aſhamed to retire; beſides, he ſaw but two companies of Abimelechs forces, verſ. 37. which might encourage him; the other two being it ſeems laid in ambuſh, for at firſt Abimelech divided his army into foure companies, verſ. 34.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. <hi>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah.]</hi> That is, he retired thither after he had beaten Gaal and his ſouldiers, and purſued them to the very gates of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem. Some conceive this of his dwelling there for ſome good time, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempting any thing againſt the Shechemites, and that he did this purpoſely to diſſemble the miſchief he intended to the Shechemites, to make a ſhew that his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell was onely againſt Gaal and his brethren, for raiſing thoſe tumults in the city, being otherwiſe willing enough to forbear the offering any violence to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the city; but becauſe it is evident that this Arumah was nigh to Shechem (for elſe he could not come thence ſo ſuddenly upon the Shechemites, as it is ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he did, verſ. 42, 43.) and the Shechemites had no reaſon to be out of fear of his intending them any hurt, ſo long as he lay with his forces in a place ſo near their city, but did therefore come out again to fight with him, verſ. 42. therefore I conceive it farre more probable, that the meaning of theſe words is onely this, that after Abimelech had purſued Gaal and his forces to the very gate of Shechem, he ſtayed not there before the city, but withdrew his forces to Arumah, a place not farre from Shechem, and abode there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Zebul thruſt out Gaal and his brethren, that they ſhould not dwell in She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem.]</hi> No doubt he took this advantage when the people were enraged for their loſſe, to accuſe them either of cowardiſe or treachery, and ſo procured them to be thruſt out of the city: for though before Zebul might not have ſpoken againſt Gaal and his brethren, yet now it was an eaſie matter to work them out of the peoples hearts.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>And it came to paſſe on the morrow, the people went out into the field,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive, that this going forth of the people into the field, was to make an end of their harveſt or vintage, or for ſome other their countrey imployments, and that becauſe, they were perſwaded by Zebul, that now they had thruſt out Gaal, Abimelech would be pacified towards them, &amp; not attempt any thing againſt them; but becauſe firſt, they had already finiſhed their vintage, and with great joy had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready thereupon kept a feaſt, by way of thankfullneſſe in the houſe of their god: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it had been an incredible ſecurity to be ſo confident, that Abimelech would give over his quarrell againſt them, conſidering how highly they had provoked him, and that he lay ſtill with his forces in a town ſo near hand, from whence he might ſo eaſily ſurpriſe them: and thirdly, Abimelechs dividing his ſouldiers into three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and laying ſome of them in ambuſh (whereof mention is made in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes) argues, that he went not againſt a naked unarmed people, ſcattered here and there about their countrey buſineſſe; I rather think, that there going forth now into the field, was to renew the battell, to revenge their former loſſe, when they fought under the command of Gaal and his brethren, and to drive Abimelech out of their coaſts.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as intending with one of theſe companies, which he kept with himſelf, to lie in

ambuſh &amp; to ſurpriſe the city on a ſudden, ſo ſoon as the Shechemites were gone out with their army, and with the other to ſet upon their army when it was gone forth a little way from the city, that ſo thoſe without the city, and thoſe within the city, might all be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 45. <hi>And beat down the citie, and ſowed it with ſalt.]</hi> Salt is both a cauſe, and ſigne of barrenneſſe and deſolation; whence it is ſaid, Pſal. 107.33, 34. that God many times turns <hi>a fruitfull land into barrenneſſe,</hi> or <hi>ſaltneſſe,</hi> as the word is in the originall, and Moab is threatned in theſe words, Zeph. 2.9. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord of hosts, the God of Iſrael, Surely Moab ſhall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and ſalt pits, and a perpetuall deſolation.</hi> And as a ſigne of deſolation, it was no doubt therefore here ſowed.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42229:80"/>
Abimelech be reckoned for one, yet it need not ſeem ſtrange that it ſhould be ſaid of him, that he aroſe <hi>to defend Iſrael,</hi> or <hi>to deliver Iſrael,</hi> as the word in the original may alſo be tranſlated: for it may well be that the land was invaded in his time by ſome of the neighbouring nations, though it be not expreſſed; and indeed conſidering that idolatry and ſuperſtition were ſo riſe in the land, all the time of Abimelechs three years tyranny, as is evident, chap. 8.33. and 9.4, 46. it is like enough that God did raiſe them up ſome adverſaries or other to plead the quarrell of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as in former times; but then beſides it might be ſaid, that he did deſend or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Iſrael, either becauſe he did happely compoſe the factious tumults and combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that were raiſed in the land in Abimelechs time; or elſe, becauſe he retained them from their idolatry, which was a great deliverance, and thence it is ſaid that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>the children of Iſrael did evill again in the ſight of the Lord and ſerved Baalim,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 6. or elſe, becauſe being raiſed of God to be Judge of Iſrael con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he was to deſend or deliver them in caſe any enemy ſhould riſe up againſt them, and oppreſſe them. As for the laſt clauſe of this verſe, where it is ſaid of this Tola, that <hi>he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim,</hi> though he were <hi>a man of Iſſachar,</hi> we need not ſtumble at that neither; for beſides, that the Iſraelites did not alwayes live in their own tribes, it is probable that in this place Tola lived for the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of executing judgement amongſt the people, Shamir in mount Ephraim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near upon in the midſt of the tribes within Jordan, and not farre too from the Tabernacle in Shiloh, which was another conſiderable advantage.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And after him aroſe Jair a Gileadite,</hi> &amp;c.] To ſhew that this Jair, the eighth Judge of Iſrael was a man of great renown before he was raiſed to be Judge, it is noted in the following verſe, that <hi>he had thirty ſonnes,</hi> to wit, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wives, that <hi>rode on aſſe-colts,</hi> as being princes and men of great place. See chap. 5.10. and <hi>that they had thirty cities called Havoth-Jair,</hi> that is, the villages of Jair. Now though there was one Jair, who at the firſt entring of the Iſraelites into Cannaan, above three hundred years before this, took all the countrey of Argob in the land of Gilead, and ſo the towns therein were called after his name, Havoth-Jair, Num. 33.41. <hi>And Jair the ſonne of Manaſſeh took the ſmall towns thereof, and called them Havoth-Jair.</hi> Deut. 3.14. <hi>Jair the ſonne of Manaſſeh took all the countrey of Argob, unto the coasts of Geſhuri, and Maachathi, and called them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own name, Baſhan Havoth-Jair;</hi> yet this muſt needs be another Jair, and ſo perhaps theſe were other towns which had their names from this Jair the Judge of Iſrael, as the other had their names from the other Jair in Moſes time; and indeed, of thoſe that were called Havoth-Jair in Moſes time, there were but three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 1. Chron. 2.22. <hi>And Zegub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the land of Gilead;</hi> yet moſt probable it is, that this man was deſcended of that Jair, and that coming to inherit ſo many of thoſe towns, which his Anceſtours had taken from the Amorites, the poſſeſſion or government whereof, he divided amongſt his thirty ſonnes, they were alſo in this regard called Havoth-Jair, the old name on a ſecond ground, being now renewed and confirmed on them, as we ſee the like in the note upon Gen. 26.33. However, this Jair was of that half tribe of Manaſſeh, that inhabited without Jordan, though he were raiſed to be Judge of all Iſrael; and doubtleſſe, one out of thoſe parts was purpoſely raiſed of God to be Judge, becauſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42229:81"/>
thoſe tribes without Jordan were to ſuffer ſo much in his dayes by the invaſion of the children of Ammon, verſ. 8. and therefore it was moſt ſit that he that was to be Judge, ſhould live amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the children of Iſrael did evil again in the ſight of the Lord, and ſerved Baalim,</hi> &amp;c.] Concerning Baalim and Aſhtaroth, ſee the Notes, chap. 2.9, 13. The hainouſneſſe of the Apoſtacy of the Iſraelites at this time, above that of their forefathers is noted, firſt, by ſetting down not onely generally that they worſhiped the idol-gods of the nations that were about them, Baalim and Aſhtaroth; but alſo particularly what a multitude of falſe gods they had now entertained, even the gods of all the nations about them, the gods of Syria, Sidon, Moab, the children of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the Philiſtines, as indeed we find elſewhere, that theſe nations had for the moſt part ſome particular gods, as Rimmon was a god amongſt the Aſſyrians. 2. Kings 15.18. and <hi>Chemoſh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon,</hi> 2. Kings 11.23. and Dagon the god of the Philiſtines, 1. Sam. 5.2. and ſecondly, that by degrees they did ſo wholly give themſelves to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of theſe falſe gods, that at length they quite laid by the worſhip of the true God in the Tabernacle built by Moſes, they <hi>forſook the Lord, and ſerved not him.</hi> When the Iſraelites began thus to Apoſtatize, it is not expreſſely ſaid, onely thus much we may certainly conclude from the text, that though the death of Jair be mentioned in the verſe before, yet it was long before his death, even immediately after the death of Tola the former Judge; and that becauſe about foure years after this, Jair began to be Judge of Iſrael (through the juſt hand of God upon them for their idolatry) the Ammonites began their incurſions into their land, as is evident in the 8. verſe of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And he ſold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.]</hi> So that they were invaded both on the eaſt and weſt; on the weſt by the Philiſtines, and on the eaſt by the children of Ammon, chap. 2.14.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And that year they vexed and oppreſſed the children of Iſrael: eighteen years, all the children of Iſrael that were on the other ſide Jordan,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Ammonites having eighteen years before in the dayes of Jair oppreſſed the Iſraelites, by many incurſions and inrodes made upon them, and eſpecially thoſe tribes that lay without Jordan in the land of the Amorites, that year that jair died, they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain invade the land, and happely in a more ſore and greivous manner, then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did oppreſſe and cruſh the poore people in all parts of the kingdome; or elſe the meaning may be, that having eighteen years before by ſeverall incurſions oppreſſed the tribes without Jordan, that yeare that Jair died, encouraged by the death of their Judge, they began to vex and oppreſſe the Iſraelites in generall, even thoſe within Jordan alſo, as it is in the following verſe, <hi>Moreover the children of Ammon paſſed over Jordan, to ſight alſo againſt Judah and againſt Benjamin, and against the houſe of Ephraim, ſo that Iſrael was ſore diſtreſſed.</hi> However the eighteen years here mentioned, muſt neceſſarily be referred to the years of Jairs government, for that place 1. Kings 6.1. will not ſuffer the years of oppreſſion to be reckoned apart from the years of the Judges; as is before noted, chap. 3.11. and to the years following they cannot be referred, if we conſider, firſt, Iſraels repenting at preſent, verſ. 10. and verſ. 16. <hi>And the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, ſaying, We have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

againſt thee, both becauſe we have forſaken our God, and alſo ſerved Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim—And they put the strange gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord:</hi> and ſecondly, that Jephthah judged the people but ſix years, chap. 12.7. and did in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his government wholy vanquiſh the Ammonites, chap. 11.32, 33. and therefore in his time the people could not be under the oppreſſion of the Ammonites eighteen years.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto the children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, either by an Angel, or by ſome Prophet, or perhaps by the high prieſt, who after enquirie made for them, returned this anſwer from the Lord; many deliverances are here mentioned which God had given them, which if they be not before particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, it is becauſe the Lord did many great things for them which are not written.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>The Zidonians alſo, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites did oppreſſe you,</hi> &amp;c.] We reade of a city called Maon, in the mountains of Judah, Joſh. 15.55. and of a wilderneſſe alſo ſo called, 1. Sam. 23.24. <hi>And they aroſe and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderneſſe of Maon.</hi> It is therefore likely that the Canaanites inhabiting there, or in the parts adjoyning, are here called Maonites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Wherefore I will deliver you no more.]</hi> God ſpeaks here after the manner of men: the meaning is, that they deſerved no more help, and that he would deliver them no more, to wit, except they did truely repent and amend that which was amiſſe; for the condition of conditionall threatnings, is not alwayes expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Do unto us whatſoever ſeemeth good unto thee, deliver us onely we pray thee this day.]</hi> Thus, firſt, they acknowledged, that for their ſinnes God might juſtly deſtroy them: ſecondly, they did willingly ſtoop under his hand, and ſubmit themſelves to whatſoever he would do: and yet thirdly, they beſought the Lord, that if it might be, he would try them once more.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Then the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead.]</hi> That is, in the land of Gilead, as in verſ. 18. which they now claimed to belong to them, chap. 11. verſ. 13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And the people and the Princes of Gilead ſaid one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus at firſt they proffered the principallitie of Gilead to any one that would undertake to lead them forth againſt the children of Ammon, till finding that no body would accept of it, they then ſent to Jephthah, as is related in the next chapter.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob.]</hi> Where this land of Tob was, we reade not, but their ſudden fetching Jephthah to be their Captain, ſhows plainly that it was a place not farre off from them.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>The Elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah, out of the land of Tob.]</hi> After that conſultation in the Aſſembly at Mizpeh, whereof chap. 10. verſ. 18. when and where the government was proffered to any man that would begin the fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ammonites, none being found either ſo fit or willing to undergo the charge, at laſt it ſeems the whole Aſſembly, moved with the great renown that Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah had got with his valour in the land of Tob, reſolved to ſend for him, and to make him their captain and head: and ſo he became the next Judge in Iſrael. At firſt it ſeems he was onely choſen to be the head of the inhabitants of Gilead, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it is evident he was Judge of all Iſrael, chap. 12.7. <hi>And Jephthah judged Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſix years.</hi> The Law indeed ſaith that no baſtard ſhould be admitted to any place of Magiſtracy amongſt the Iſraelites, as you may ſee in the note upon Deut. 23.2. <hi>A baſtard ſhall not enter into the congregation of the Lord:</hi> but neceſſitie now forced them to do, what they do, and that not without the ſpeciall providence of God, who might diſpence with his own Law.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And the Elders of Gilead ſaid unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, we acknowledge this thou ſayeſt to be true, but therefore now we come to ſeek thy favour, and to make amends for the unkindneſſe then prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thee, we deſire thine aid upon no other condition, but that thou ſhalt be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the Lord deliver them before me, ſhall I be your head?]</hi> That is, will you be as good as your word to make me governour of the land of Gilead? becauſe they had formerly dealt injuriouſly with him, he was the more carefull now to look to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement he made with them: nor was Jephthah to be blamed for an ambitious and greedy deſire to rule over them, in that he laboured thus to make ſure that he might be their head; as will be evident, if we conſider, firſt, that he might the rather deſire this, leſt if he ſhould have lived afterwards amongſt them in a private condition, his brethren not yet forgetting the old quarrells that had been between them, might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him ſome injury: and ſecondly, that he might be carefull to ſecure the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they tendered him, out of a deſire to do good to the people; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as he might lawfully imbrace it, when it was proffered him, as beleiving that

                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Becauſe Iſrael took away my land when they came out of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] A great part of that land which the Iſraelites took from Sihon king of the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; yea, and from Og king of Baſhan, had been before by thoſe kings taken from the Ammonites, eſpecially from the Moabites, as we may ſee in the note upon Num. 21.26. <hi>For Heſhbon was the city of Sihon king of the Ammorites, who had fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> Joſh. 13.25. <hi>And their coaſt was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon.</hi> Deut. 3.11. <hi>For onely Og king of Baſhan remained of the remnant of gyants; behold his bedſtead was a bedſtead of iron: is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon:</hi> all which the king of the Ammonites claims now as belonging to him, being alſo it ſeems king of the Moabites: whence Chemoſh the idol of Moab is called his god.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Iſrael took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon.]</hi> Hereby alſo it ſeems probable that the king of the children of Ammon, did at this time alſo command over Moab in chief, and thereupon challenged all that land which Sihon had firſt taken from the Moabites, and then the Iſraelites from him; for why is it elſe that Jephthah here anſwers, that the Iſraelites meddled not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the land of Moab, or with the land of the children of Ammon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>But when the Iſraelites came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderneſſe unto the red ſea, and came to Kadeſh.]</hi> Not Kadeſh-Barnea, but that Kadeſh bordering upon the land of Edom, whence they ſent meſſengers to the king of Edom to deſire a paſſage through his land, Num. 20.14. <hi>And Moſes ſent meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers from Kadeſh unto the King of Edom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17, <hi>And Iſrael abode in Kadeſh,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, there they ſtayed till they ſent meſſengers to the king of Edom, and received an anſwer back from him, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to enter his land; yea, and when he denyed them a paſſage, they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the trouble of fetching a great compaſſe about his land, rather then they would be any way injurious to him, as is expreſſed in the following words, verſ. 18. <hi>Then went they along through the wilderneſſe, and compaſſed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the eaſt ſide of the land of Moab, and pitched in the north ſide of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab:</hi> all which Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah now relates, to let them ſee how fairly the Iſraelites dealt with all the nations they paſſed by, and how farre they were from offering violence to any of the nations that bordered upon the land of Canaan,</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And pitched on the north ſide of Arnon, but came not within the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Moab,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby they prove that the Iſraelites were ſo farre from taking
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42229:83"/>
any of the land of the Moabites from them, they that came not within their border.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>But Sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in Jahaz, and fought againſt Iſrael.]</hi> This diſcovers the juſt cauſe they had to fight againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites; and the juſtneſſe of their cauſe herein tends ſtrongly to juſtifie their intereſt in that land, which through Gods aſſiſtance, in this warre they recovered from them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Wilt not thou poſſeſſe that which Chemoſh thy god giveth thee to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe?</hi> &amp;c.] Molech or Melchom was the idol-god of the Ammonites, 1. Kings 11.7. <hi>Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemoſh, the abomination of Moab in the hill that is before Jeruſalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon:</hi> and verſ. 33. <hi>Becauſe they have forſaken me, and worſhipped Aſhtaroth the goddeſſe of the Sidonians, Chemoſh the god of the Moabites and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon:</hi> ſee alſo 2. Kings 23.13. but Chemoſh was the god of the Moabites, Num: 21.29. <hi>Wo to thee Moab, thou art undone O people of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſh.</hi> Jer. 48.13. <hi>Moab ſhall be aſhamed of Chemoſh.</hi> Now in that Jephthah ſpeaking to the king of the Ammonites, calls Chemoſh his god, it ſeems hereby alſo not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that this king of the Ammonites was at preſent king of the Moabites; and becauſe the Moabites (yea the children of Ammon too) had formerly taken their land from other people that had anciently inhabited it, Deut. 2.9, 10. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto me, Diſtreſſe not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battell; for I will not give thee of their land for a poſſeſſion, becauſe I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a poſſeſſion. The Emims dwelt therein in times paſt, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims:</hi> and verſ. 19, 20. <hi>And when thou comeſt nigh over againſt the children of Ammon, diſtreſſe them not —becauſe I have given it unto the children of Lot for a poſſeſſion (that alſo was counted a land of gyants) gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants dwelt therein in old time, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</hi> and were ready enough to aſcribe this to the help they had received from their god Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſh; hence Jephthah wiſheth the king to conſider whether it were not as juſt that the Iſraelites ſhould keep that land which the Lord their God had given them to poſſeſſe, as that the Moabites ſhould hold that which they pretended their god Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſh had conferred upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And now art thou any thing better then Balak the ſonne of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever ſtrive against Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, art thou wiſer or more puiſſant, or haſt thou any better title then Balak had that was king of Moab; now if he would never ſtrive againſt Iſrael, nor fight againſt them, to wit, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that land out of their hands, which they had taken from the Amorites, why then ſhouldeſt thou ſo many years after, pretend a title and think by force to carry it away? indeed Balak oppoſed the Iſraelites, for fear they would have entered his land, but neither he nor any of his poſterity did ever make warre with them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were ſettled in the land of the Amorites, under pretence the land was theirs; of which onely Jephthah ſpeaks, as is evident by the words of the following verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>While Iſrael dwelt in Heſhbon and her towns, and Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coaſts of Arnon, three hundred years?]</hi> Here he pleads preſcription: having peaceably enjoyed the land ſo many years, it was a ſilly thing in the king of the Ammonites, now to pretend a title to it. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of theſe three hundred years, it is hard to ſay how they muſt be reckoned.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42229:83"/>
They that reckon the years of the Ifraelites oppreſſion, apart from the years of the Judges, muſt needs find from the Iſraelites conqueſt of this land, to this time, at leaſt three hundred thirty ſix years; which diſcovers this computation to be erroneous; no doubt Jephthah would have made the moſt he could of the years they had enjoyed the land. But now reckoning onely the years of the Judges, allowing to Joſhua ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years (ſee the note upon Joſh. 24.29.) to Othniel fourty, to Ehud eighty, to Barak fourty, to Gideon fourty, to Abimelech three, to Tola three and twenty, and to Jair two and twenty, we find leſſe then three hundred years, to wit, but two hundred ſixty five. But to this we anſwer, either that Jephthah to help his cauſe made the moſt of the time, this being uſuall in the Scripture, yea and in mens ordinary ſpeech, to reckon a full round number, when the years of which they ſpeak are not exactly ſo many, but near about ſo many; or elſe, that theſe two hundred ſixty five years, wherein the Iſraelites had poſſeſſed it, muſt needs be made up three hundred by the addition of thoſe years wherein Sihon and Og held it, after they took it from the Moabites and Ammonites, whoſe right the Iſraelites had by the law of conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>The Lord the Judge, be Judge this day between the children of Iſrael, and the children of Ammon.]</hi> That is, by giving victory at this time to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent party, may the Lord the great Judge of all the world make it manifeſt, whether the Iſraelites have unjuſtly detained from the Ammonites, that which belonged to them, or whether the children of Ammon do not moſt unjuſtly upon a groundleſſe pretence, make warre now againſt the children of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>Then the ſpirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note chap. 3.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Whatſoever cometh forth of the doores of my houſe to meet me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall ſurely be the Lords, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.]</hi> It is a great queſtion, whether Jephthah did by this vow intend to bind himſelf to offer as a burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whatſoever ſhould firſt come out of his houſe to meet him; and indeed according to the Hebrew, the words may be reade disjunctively, as it is in the margin; <hi>It ſhall ſurely be the Lords, or I will offer it up for a burnt offering;</hi> and then his meaning muſt needs be, that whatſoever ſhould firſt meet him out of his houſe, ſhould ſome way be conſecrated to the Lord, and if it were any thing fit for Gods altar, it ſhould be offered for a burnt offering. But I conceive that Jephthah did abſolutely intend that which he vowed for a burnt offering, and that for theſe two reaſons; firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt clauſe being generall, <hi>It ſhall ſurely be the Lords,</hi> and comprehending that which follows of offering a burnt offering, it cannot with any propriety of ſpeech be read disjunctively, <hi>It ſhall ſurely be the Lords, or I will offer it up for a burnt offrring,</hi> no more then he could have ſaid, I will offer a clean beaſt or a ſheep: and ſecondly, becauſe the bitter lamentation which he made, when he ſaw his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come forth to meet him, is a ſtrong argument to prove that he apprehended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound by his vow to offer her for a burnt offering; yea, indeed I make little queſtion but he meant what he ſaid merely concerning a humane ſacrifice, to wit, that whatſoever it were either man or woman that came firſt out of his houſe to meet him, it ſhould be ſacrificed to the Lord, as indeed the manner of ſpeech here uſed doth plainly imply; for what elſe but a man or woman could come out of his houſe of purpoſe to meet him, by way of congratulating the great victory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42229:84"/>
God had honoured him? It is indeed ſtrange, that an Iſraelite, yea a faithfull good man (for he is reckoned by S. Paul, Heb. 11.32. amongſt Gods worthies that through faith did accompliſh great things) ſhould be ſo ignorant of Gods Law, as to think to pleaſe God with that which was ſo expreſſely there forbidden, Deut. 12.30, 31. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf that thou be not ſnared by following them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for every abomination to the Lord which he hateth, have they done unto their gods: for even their ſonnes, and their daughters, have they burnt in the fire to their gods.</hi> Yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, had he been never ſo great a ſtranger to the Law of God, as being a man train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the warre, and that too a great part of his life amongſt heathens out of the land of Iſrael, yet the ſacrificing of men and women, is a ſinne ſo much againſt the light of nature, that one would think it ſhould not come into the thought of a man that had any ſpark of grace in him: Well, but yet the letter of the text being ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe for this, I ſee not how it can be determined otherwiſe, but that in this vow of his he did intend a humane ſacrifice; and that we may not ſtumble too much at the ſtrangeneſſe of it, we muſt conſider, firſt, that the people of Iſrael were for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity never ſo farre fallen away from the knowledge and worſhip of the true God, or ſo farre corrupted with the abominations of the heathens, as they were now; we ſee that it is ſaid before, in the ſixth verſe of this chapter, that <hi>they forſook the Lord, and ſerved not him,</hi> but were wholly gone aſide after the idolatry of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: ſecondly, that Jephthah had hitherto perhaps, lived in as much darkneſſe as the reſt, and that the rather, becauſe he had ſpent ſo much of his time out of the land of Iſrael, and therefore though at this time God had called him, and ſo the ſpirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, that for the preſent he ſhould make ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth and unwarrantable vow in ſuch dark times, is not at all incredible: thirdly, that there being a ſort of vowes mentioned in the Law of God, wherein the perſons devoted to be put to death, Levit. 27.29. <hi>None devoted which ſhall be devoted of men ſhall be redeemed; but ſhall ſurely be put to death,</hi> this Jephthah might take to be a j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt warrant for his vow, though indeed it were not: and fourthly, that Jephthah made this vow raſhly, not conſidering the miſchief that might follow upon it, being at that time tranſported with the fervency of his zeal for the reſcuing Gods people from the oppreſſion of the Ammonites; for to this end, that he might have the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites delivered into his hand, he ſought as it were to demerit Gods favour by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing this extraordinary gift, and by binding himſelf ſolemnly to do that for God, which the heart of man would ſtartle at.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And he ſmote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven twenty cities,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the inhabitants of twenty cities, and thoſe in the land of the Ammonites, for they were beyond Aroer, which was the bounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Iſrael and Ammon: of Minnith there is mention made, Ezek. 27.17. <hi>Judah and the land of Iſrael, they were thy merchants, they traded in thy market, wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>Alas, my daughter, thou haſt brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, God having raiſed me to a high pitch of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by this glorious victory which I have now attained over the Ammonites, thou who mighteſt have reaped a great ſhare in mine honour, and thereby have added unto my joy, haſt now humbled me, and deprived me of all the glory and comfort
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42229:84"/>
of my victory, and haſt brought more trouble upon me, then all mine enemies could have done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>And ſhe ſaid unto him, my father, if thou hast opened thy mouth,</hi> &amp;c.] By thoſe words of her father mentioned in the former verſe, <hi>Alas, my daughter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back,</hi> ſhe might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he had made ſome vow concerning her but could not know what that vow was; and therefore it is evident, that beſides what is expreſſed in the foregoing verſe, her father had alſo acquainted her what the vow was that he had made, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being erroneouſly perſwaded, that he was bound to make good his vow, ſhe freely offers her ſelf to undergo what he had vowed, as being ready to die, rather then he ſhould ſinne againſt God by breaking his vow, and deſirous, by diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her willingneſſe to conſent thereto, to appeaſe and mitigate his ſorrow as much as in her lay.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>Let me alone two moneths, that I may go up and down upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains &amp; bewail my virginity,</hi> &amp;c.] She choſe the mountains to do this in, becauſe thoſe unfrequented and ſolitary places were fitteſt for the bitter lamentations and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expreſſions of their grief, wherewith ſhe reſolved with her companions in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner to bewail this heavy affliction that was fallen upon her, and happely, withall, ſhe deſired by retiring to thoſe unfrequented places, to fit and prepare her ſelf for that death, which within a ſhort time ſhe was to undergo, for though ſhe ſpake onely of her bewailing her virginity, yet thereby is meant that ſhe would bewail her dying a virgin, implying how much this did aggravate her ſorrow, that ſhe ſhould die without leaving any poſterity behind her; and indeed to die childleſſe, was in thoſe times eſteemed one of the greateſt of earthly miſeries. There are many learned Expoſitours that conceive that Jephthahs vow was, that whatſoever ſhould firſt meet him, ſhould be the Lords, and that if it were a creature which by the Law might be offered in a ſacrifice, then he would offer it for a burnt offering; &amp; ſo many of them read his vow disjunctively, as is noted before, verſ. 3. <hi>It ſhall ſurely be the Lords, or I will offer it up for a burnt offering:</hi> and ſo they conceive that his daughter was not ſacrificed, but onely ſhut up there in perpetuall virginity, to ſpend all her time in the ſervice of God, and therefore ſhe deſires not reſpite to bewail her death, but to bewail her virginity. But many things make this opinion leſſe probable: for firſt, we reade not the leaſt touch in the Scripture, of any ſuch ſeparating men or women to the ſervice of God, in a monaſticall life, much leſſe, that parents ſhould have this power over their children, to vow them to virginity without their conſent. Samuel, that was conſecrated to God from his infancy was yet married, and had many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: ſecondly, if his vow muſt be underſtood of any thing that ſhould firſt meet him (whereof ſee verſ. 31.) we may demand what if a dog or a ſwine had met him, yea, what if his wife or any of his married ſervants had met him, that could not have been devoted to perpetuall virginity; for to avoid this it cannot be reaſonably anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſuch might have been redeemed, for if they ſpeak of redemtion in theſe caſes, then we reply, why might not his daughter have been redeemed too, that being alſo allowed by the Law, Levit. 27.5. <hi>And if it be from five years old, even to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old, then thy estimation ſhall be of the male twenty ſhekels, and for the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ten ſhekels:</hi> and thirdly, the bitter lamentation of Jephthah, verſ. 35. <hi>Alas, my
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42229:85"/>
daughter thou haſt brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me,</hi> ſhews, that there was ſomething more in his vow, then the conſecrating of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to perpetuall virginity.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>She returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed.]</hi> That is, he ſacrificed her, it is indeed ſtrange, that having two moneths liberty to deliberate about it, he was not all that time, either by the prieſts, or ſome other reſolved, both how unlawfull his vow was, and how lawfully he might now break it. But much muſt be aſcribed to the ignorance, corruption, and confuſion of theſe times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhe knew no man.]</hi> Theſe words are added to imply, that this did much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate Jephthahs loſſe, that his daughter died childleſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it was a cuſtome in Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that foure dayes every year the daughters of Iſrael went into the mountains to bewail Jephthahs daughter, as it follows, verſ. 40. at firſt happely they met onely that were her companions, but at laſt it grew to be an anniverſary cuſtome, and it may be was the rather taken up and continued, that it might be a memoriall to warn men to take heed of all ſuch raſh and unlawfull vowes.</p>

                     <hi>Wherefore paſſedſt thou over to fight againſt the children of Ammon, and didſt not call us to go with thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Upon the ſame ground they quarrelled before with Gideon, chap. 8. verſ. 1. Jephthah, as is evident by his anſwer, verſ. 2. had ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to deſire them to come and expell the Ammonites out of their coaſts, and could not perſwade them to undertake it; yet now himſelf had done it, they envy his victory, and quarrell with him, becauſe he did not call them to go with him, to wit, as pretending that though he called them to expell the Ammonites out of their coaſts, yet he did not make known to them his own reſolution to go againſt them, nor did deſire them to joyn with him, and ſo made this the ground of their quarrell: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gave the Gileadites many opprobrious and reviling ſpeeches, verſ. 4. <hi>And the men of Gilead ſmote Ephraim, becauſe they ſaid, ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And when I ſaw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and paſſed over againſt the children of Ammon,</hi> &amp;c.] All expoſitours agree, that by this phraſe, <hi>I put my life in my hands,</hi> Jephthah meant, that he expoſed his life to manifeſt danger, to wit, becauſe he went againſt the children of Ammon, with forces no way anſwerable to theirs, and that thereby Jephthah intended to intimate to the men of Ephraim, that he would have been glad of their aſſiſtance, that he might not have gone out upon ſo much hazard of his life as he did. But whence was that phraſe, that when a man expoſed his life to manifeſt perill he was ſaid to put his life in his hands? I anſwer, the reaſon of this phraſe ſome conceive to be this, that when a man carries any precious thing that is brittle in his hands, it is in danger to fall, or to be ſnatched away ſuddenly from him. But I rather conceive the ground of it to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when a man intends to lay down or deliver up any thing to another, he takes
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42229:85"/>
it into his hands, that he may deliver it up, and therefore he that expoſeth his life to manifeſt perill for any cauſe, is ſaid to take his life into his hands, becauſe for that cauſe he is ready to lay down his life, according to that, 1. John 3.16. <hi>Hereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</hi> And indeed it may well be, which a learned divine hath obſerved, that they were wont in former times to picture the Martyrs of the Primitive Church with their heads in their hands, onely to expreſſe this by way of Hieroglyphick, that they laid down their lives for the cauſe of Chriſt, which the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people not underſtanding in the ſucceeding dark times of Popery, they thence raiſed thoſe abſurd and ridiculous tales and legends of divers Martyrs, that when their heads were cut off, did notwithſtanding walk a certain way with their heads in their hands.</p>

Now the Ephraimites and the other half of Manaſſeh which were ſeated within Jordan, and that next to the tribe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, they lived lovingly together, and kept good correſpondence the one with the other, as being both deſcended of Joſeph, and having continually commerce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by reaſon of their neighbourhood: but having no commerce with the other half tribe of Manaſſeh without Jordan, becauſe they dwelt ſo farre off from them, even their brethren the Manaſſites within Jordan began to grow ſtrange to them, and at laſt to deſpiſe and ſcorn them, as if they had been no better then fugitives that were runne away from them, the very ſcumme and refuſe of their tribe caſt out into the utmoſt bounds of that land without Jordan, as unworthy to live with the reſt of their brethren in the heart of the land of Canaan: and this is that which in their fury theſe Ephraimites do with ſcorn caſt into the teeth of the Gileadites: that both themſelves and their brethren of Manaſſeh, did eſteem the Gileadites no better then fugitives of Ephraim, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the children of Iſrael did evil again in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] This Apoſtacie of the children of Iſrael was doubtleſſe in the dayes of Ibzan the next Judge after Jephthah, chap. 12. verſ. 8. as may appear by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of thoſe fourtie years wherein the Philiſtines oppreſſed Iſrael, mentioned in the following words. <hi>And the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines fourtie years;</hi> for the twenty years wherein Samſon judged Iſrael muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be accounted one half of theſe fourtie years of the Philiſtines oppreſſion, as is evident chap. 15. verſ. 20. <hi>And he judged Iſrael in the dayes of the Philiſtines twenty years:</hi> and the other half to wit the other twenty years muſt needs begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Samſon was born, to wit, about the fifth yeare of Ibzans judging Iſrael; for when the Angel appeared to Samſons mother, the Philiſtines oppreſſed Iſrael: whence he tells her for her comfort, verſe 5. that he ſhould deliver Iſrael out of the hands of the Philiſtines. And indeed Jephthahs ſlaying two and fourty thouſand of the Ephraimites, chap. 12. verſ. 6. muſt needs be a great weakning to the Iſraelites in thoſe parts, and was like enough to encourage the Philiſtines to invade their land within a ſhort time after Jephthah was dead.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whoſe name was Manoah.]</hi> So that Samſon the ſonne of this Manoah, was of the tribe of Dan: This tribe bordering upon the land of the Philiſtines was moſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to their incurſions, and therefore God was pleaſed now to raiſe up a Judge for the Iſraelites out of this tribe, to wit, Samſon the ſonne of this Manoah, to whoſe exploits againſt the Philiſtines, ſome conceive that Jacob had reſpect in that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy concerning this tribe, Gen. 49.16, 17. <hi>Dan ſhall Judge his people, as one of the tribes of Iſrael; Dan ſhall be a ſerpent in the way, an adder in the path that biteth the horſe heels, ſo that his rider ſhall fall backward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and ſaid unto her, behold now thou art barren,</hi> &amp;c.] He firſt mentions her barrenneſſe, that the following tydings concerning her conceiving with child, might be the more joyfully received by her; it is a great queſtion among Expoſitours, what this <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> was, that now appeared to Manoahs wife, ſome conceiving that it was a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Angel, and that becauſe as they ſay, he afterwards chargeth Manoah not to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to him, but to the Lord, verſ. 16. <hi>If thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord.</hi> And others again conceiving, that it was the very ſonne of God, that great Angel of the covenant, and that becauſe, verſ. 18. he ſaith, his name was <hi>ſecret,</hi> or <hi>wonderfull,</hi> but eſpecially, becauſe verſ. 22. Manoah ſaith, they had ſeen God, and verſ. 23. his wife calls him <hi>the Lord,</hi> that is, the Jehovah; and indeed, though theſe be not unanſwerable proofes, yet conſidering that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably evident in other places, that in theſe times the ſonne of God did uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear to other the ſervants of God, I ſhould judge it moſt probable, that it was he that did now alſo appear in the ſhape of a man to the wife of Manoah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Drink not wine nor ſtrong drink, and eat not unclean any thing.</hi> Becauſe her child was to be a Nazarite from the wombe, as it follows, verſ. 5. therefore ſhe might not eat or drink thoſe things that were unlawfull for the Nazarites, to wit,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42229:86"/>
neither whilſt ſhe was with child, nor whilſt ſhe gave ſuck, in regard that all that time, that which ſhe did eat or drink was for the nouriſhment of her child too. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the unclean meat forbidden her, may be meant any meat forbidden in the Law, Levit. 11. for it is no wonder though the Angel charges her to beware of ſuch meats which were unlawfull for any Iſraelite to eat, as well as Nazarites; firſt, becauſe it is likely in theſe times ſo full of confuſion and diſorder, both this and many other of Gods Laws, were altogether diſregarded by the people in generall: &amp; ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though ſuch meats were unlawfull for any Iſraelite, yet much more for Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. But yet here I rather think ſuch meats are meant, as were unclean for the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites though not for others, ſuch as were grapes moiſt or dryed, yea any meats that were made of the vine tree, from the kernel even to the husk: Num. 6.3, 4. <hi>He ſhall ſeparate himſelf from wine and ſtrong drink, and ſhall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of ſtrong drink, neither ſhall he eat any liquour of grapes, nor eat moiſt grapes or dried. All the dayes of his ſeparation, ſhall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernel even to the husk.</hi> Concerning which Law, ſee the note there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>The child ſhall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb.</hi> This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment not a prediction, as is alſo the other clauſe before, <hi>no raſour ſhall come on his head;</hi> for we ſee his hair was afterwards cut off, chap. 16.19. <hi>And ſhe made him ſleep upon her knees, and ſhe called for a man and ſhe cauſed him to ſhave off the ſeven locks of his head, and ſhe began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſhall begin to deliver Iſrael out of the hand of the Philiſtines.]</hi> It is ſaid here that Samſon ſhould <hi>begin to deliver Iſrael out of the hand of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines:</hi> firſt, becauſe the Iſraelites were many years oppreſſed by the Philiſtines, and the Lord ſent them no ſaviour, till at length Samſon when he came of age, was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by the ſpirit of God to undertake this work, and ſo he was the firſt that did any thing towards the foiling of the Philiſtines: ſecondly, becauſe though he did not wholy vanquiſh them (for after Samſons death they did often infeſt &amp; annoy the Iſraelites) yet did he ſo farre weaken them, eſpecially by the laſt blow that he gave them at his death, when he ſlew all their Princes and many of the people, that they ſcarſe ever recovered their former ſtrength: and thirdly, becauſe the work of ſhaking off the yoke of the Philiſtines that was begun by Samſon, was followed on after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the dayes of Eli, Samuel, and Saul (for they never were after this in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the Philiſtines) till at length they were perfectly ſubdued by David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of an Angel of God, very terrible.]</hi> That is, his countenance was very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, and full of reverend Majeſty, and ſuch as wrought a kind of aſtoniſhment and fear in me.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>For the child ſhall be a Nazarite to God from the womb, to the day of his death.]</hi> Others that took upon them the vow of a Nazarite, were onely ſuch for a time, namely, ſo long as they had vowed to conſecrate themſelves unto the Lord, in this ſtrict way of ſingular holineſſe, which was therefore called the dayes of their ſeparation; ſee the notes Num. 6.3, 4, 5. But now Samſon was in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way ſeparate to be a Nazarite, to wit, by the appointment and command of God, and not by his own voluntary vow, and therefore he was to be a Nazarite all his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42229:87"/>
life, <hi>from the womb to the day of his death;</hi> and herein was Samſon above other Nazarites, a type of Chriſt, who was from his firſt conception perfectly ſanctified: Luke 2.35. <hi>That holy thing which ſhall be born of thee</hi> (ſaith the Angel to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary) <hi>ſhall be called the ſonne of God,</hi> and ſo continued all his dayes, <hi>holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26. and that to the end he might be the ſaviour of Gods people: for the better manifeſtation whereof, it was that God by his providence did ſo order it, that he was (though upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) called a Nazarene, Matht. 2.23. <hi>And he came and dwelt in a city called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets, He ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Nazarene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the woman made haste, and ran and ſhewed her husband,</hi> &amp;c.] Knowing how earneſtly her husband had prayed unto the Lord, that he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſend that man of God to them, that had at firſt brought her the tidings of her conception; no ſooner did ſhe now ſee him again, but as taking this to be an anſwer of his prayer, and therefore not doubting but he would ſtay till ſhe came back again, and withall longing to make glad the heart of her husband, ſhe <hi>made haſte and ran,</hi> as the text ſaith, to tell her husband of it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Though thou detain me, yet I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou muſt offer it unto the Lord.]</hi> Manoah had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, <hi>I pray thee, let us detain thee untill we ſhall have made ready a kid for thee:</hi> now becauſe thoſe words may be meant, eſpecially as they are in the originall, either his preparing a kid merely for him to eat, or elſe for preparing a kid for a ſacrifice, to wit, of a peace-offering (for with ſuch ſacrifices they uſed to feaſt their friends, after they had offered the fat unto the Lord) accordingly the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord anſwers Manoah in theſe words: for firſt, he abſolutely refuſeth to eat of any proviſion that he ſhould make ready for him, <hi>Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread;</hi> and this he ſaith, not becauſe Angels in thoſe aſſumed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wherein they appear to men, cannot eat; for we ſee the contrary expreſſely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, concerning the Angels that appeared to Abraham, when as yet they would not be known to be any other but men, Gen. 18.8. <hi>He took butter and milk, and the calf which he had diſtreſſed and ſet it before them—and they did eat,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he now deſired to lead on Manoah by degrees, to apprehend him to be more then a man, which as yet Manoah had not conceived: and then ſecondly, he addes, <hi>and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou muſt offer it to the Lord:</hi> wherein he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to Manoah, that he vvould not have him think of providing a ſacrifice, that he might eat of it; yet if he had a mind to offer a burnt offering, he ſhould approve of that; onely he then gives him vvarning to take heed of having any other thought then to offer it to the Lord Jehovah onely. As concerning the reaſon vvhy he gives him that expreſſe caveat, that he ſhould be ſure that he did not think of offering his burnt offering to any but the Lord; I conceive it to be onely, becauſe many of the Iſraelites did at this time vvorſhip the idol-gods of the heathens, and therefore the Angel took this occaſion to bid him to beware of that. Many Expoſitours indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Angel that novv appeared to Manoah, being a created Angel, ſpake this purpoſely to beat off Manoah from thinking to offer any ſacrifice to him: and others that hold it was the Sonne of God that novv appeared to him, underſtand
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42229:87"/>
theſe words as if he had ſaid, If you think of offering me a burnt offering, you muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to me as the true God, not as to a created angel: but firſt, becauſe there is nothing ſaid before, whereby it may be gathered that Manoah intended to offer a ſacrifice to the Angel: and ſecondly, becauſe it is manifeſt that as yet he took him to be a man as himſelf was, ſome prophet ſent unto him from God, as it follows in the next words, <hi>Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord:</hi> I ſee not why we ſhould think that the angel ſpake theſe words with reſpect to himſelf, but rather to give him warning of the idolatrie that was then too riſe in the land.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>What is thy name, that when thy ſayings come to paſſe we may do thee honour?]</hi> That is, that we may make report to others concerning this thy foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling future things, and ſo both we and they may eſteem and honour thee as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the moſt high God. This I conceive is chiefly intended; though withall it may be meant of ſome bountifull reward wherewith (by way of gratitude) he meant to honour him, that is, to teſtifie their honourable and high eſteem of him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Why askeſt thou thus farre after my name, ſeeing it is ſecret?]</hi> Or <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is wonderfull,</hi> as it is in the margin of our Bibles, for the word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſignifieth both <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>wonderfull.</hi> If we hold that this was a created angel that now appeared to Manoah, there is no neceſſitie that we ſhould thereupon make enquirie, as many Papiſts have very buſily done, whether the holy angels in heaven have all of them their ſeverall names, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed and known, when the angels would impart any thing one to another concerning any particular angel. For though there is no queſtion to be made but the angels both can and do impart what they would make known both one to another and one concerning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yet becauſe they do this not by words or vocall expreſſions, but as ſpirits in a ſpirituall manner, and ſuch as we are not able to conceive; how is it poſſible that we ſhould determine any thing concerning their names? Sufficient it is for us to know that even in this regard the angel might well anſwer Manoah, that his name was <hi>ſecret</hi> or <hi>wonderfull,</hi> that is, that it was a thing not to be revealed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be enquired into; or a thing too wonderfull for him to underſtand, or that as the other angels ſo he alſo had no other name but this, that he was one of thoſe miniſtring ſpirits whom God did continually employ in the effecting of many wonderfull works for his people, with reſpect whereto therefore it may well be that verſ. 19. it is expreſſely noted, <hi>that the angel did wondrouſly.</hi> But now granting what was formerly ſaid, that this angel of the Lord was the Sonne of God, the great angel of the Covenant, it muſt needs ſeem the leſſe ſtrange that he ſhould tell Manoah that his name was <hi>ſecret</hi> and not to be ſearched into, or <hi>wonderfull</hi> and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: and that becauſe firſt, as he is very God, his name, that is, his eſſence or being is infinitely above our underſtanding, it is a ſecret we muſt not prie into, it is too wonderfull for us, onely we know of him what by his word and works he hath been pleaſed to reveal to us, and that is enough to aſtoniſh any man that will ſeriouſly ponder it with himſelf: and ſecondly, as he was appointed of God to be in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the mediatour between God and man, there was nothing in him nor nothing that was to be done by him, but was every way wonderfull; whence it is that the prophet ſaid of him, <hi>His name ſhall be called wonderfull,</hi> Iſa. 9.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>So Manoah took a kid with a meat-offering, and offered it,</hi> &amp;c.] Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42229:88"/>
the perſon ſacrificing, nor the place where they offered this ſacrifice were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by the law; but the allowance of the angel, verſ. 16. <hi>If thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord,</hi> was warrant ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>For it came to paſſe when the flame went up towards heaven from off the altar,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe there is no mention made either of wood or of fire that was brought by Manoah for the offering of this ſacrifice, therefore many Expoſitours hold, that by the miniſterie of the angel there came fire out of the rock to conſume the burnt offering, as it was before in Gideons ſacrifice, chap. 6.21. But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly be concluded from thence. However, it was doubtleſſe the angels aſcending up in the flame of the altar, that was the principall miraculous work, whereby the angel did diſcover what he was to Manoah and his wife; and methinks too, this is one of the ſtrongeſt evidences to make it moſt probable that this angel was the Sonne of God, and that becauſe his going up to heaven in the flame of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, did moſt ſweetly repreſent and ſhadow forth the office of Chriſt, the great Angel of the covenant, whoſe work it is to preſent all our ſervices before God, and to procure them to be graciouſly accepted of him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Manoah ſaid unto his wife, We ſhall ſurely die,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note chap. 6.22.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>But his wife ſaid unto him, If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would not have received a burnt offering,</hi> &amp;c.] By three ſeverall arguments doth Manoahs wife comfort him: firſt, from Gods accepting of their ſacrifice; and that ſhe takes for granted, becauſe the angel adviſed them to offer that their ſacrifice, verſ. 16. <hi>If thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou muſt offer it unto the Lord:</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe he had made known Gods accepting of it, both by that his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous aſcending up to heaven in the flame of it, whereby they might ſee that their ſacrifice went up with him into the preſence of God; and alſo (as Expoſitours gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceive) by cauſing fire miraculouſly to aſcend out of the rock, and conſume the ſacrifice as formerly in that of Gideons. Judg. 6.21. <hi>The angel of the Lord put forth the end of the ſtaff that was in his hand, and touched the fleſh and the unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened cakes, and there aroſe fire out of the rock, &amp; conſumed the fleſh and the unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened cakes:</hi> ſecondly, from thoſe wonders God had ſhewed them; <hi>neither,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>would he have ſhewed us all theſe things,</hi> that is, all theſe miraculous ſignes of Gods favour towards us, to wit, the ſtrange burning of the ſacrifice, and aſcending of the angel in the flame thereof: and thirdly from his imparting thoſe ſecrets to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their child, <hi>Nor,</hi> ſaith ſhe; <hi>would he as at this time have told us ſuch things as theſe,</hi> that is, neither would he thus beforehand in a time of ſuch great diſtreſſe, have told us ſuch comfortable tidings concerning the birth and education of our child, and the worthy ſervice he ſhould do for the deliverance of his Church and people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the child grew, and the Lord bleſſed him.]</hi> That is, he indued him with admirable ſtrength of body, courage of mind, and all other gifts requiſite for thoſe worthy ſervices God had appointed him to do.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan,</hi> &amp;c.] The camp of Dan was either the place of Samſons dwelling, ſo called by occaſion of that which we find written, concerning the expedition of the Danites
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42229:88"/>
againſt Laiſh, which it ſeems was before the dayes of Samſon, chap. 18.11, 12. <hi>And there went from thence of the familie of the Danites out of Zorah, and out of Eſhtaol ſix hundred men appointed with weapons of warre. And they went up and pitched in Kiriath-jearim in Judah: wherefore they call that place Mahaneh-Dan unto this day:</hi> or elſe it may be meant of a camp which the Danites had formed at preſent in this place, having raiſed an army to withſtand the incurſions of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, who did ſorely now oppreſſe them; where Samſon ſerving in his young years, began to give proof of the noble acts he ſhould afterwards do. For the ſpirit of God began now and then at times to come upon him, and to put him upon ſtrange and admirable exploits, even beyond the ordinary courage and ſtrength of man.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Samſon went down to Timnath,</hi> &amp;c.] A citie that was at firſt in the lot of Judah, Joſh. 15.57. and afterward was ſeparated for the tribe of Dan, Joſh. 19.43. but was often (if not alwayes) in the poſſeſſion of the Philiſtines, in the confines of whoſe land it ſtood; and ſo now it ſeems it was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>I have ſeen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines, now therefore get her for me to wife.]</hi> It was unlawfull for any Iſraelite, much more for a Nazarite, to marry with a daughter of the Philiſtines, Deut. 7.3. but it ſeems Samſon did this not without a ſpeciall warrant from God, either by revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by a ſtrong inſtinct of the ſpirit, which he knew well was of God; as appears, firſt, becauſe it is ſaid verſ. 4. that he ſought an occaſion againſt the Philiſtines; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe it is expreſſed there alſo, that his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord; which implies that Samſon knew it well enough: and yet though he had a ſpeciall warrant from God, he would not do it without deſiring the conſent of his parents.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, neither amongſt thy kindred, nor amongſt all the people of Iſrael; thus his parents at firſt ſought to diſſwade him from this match becauſe it was againſt the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Samſon ſaid unto his father, Get her for me, for ſhe pleaſeth me well.]</hi> In theſe words Samſon might have reſpect to this, that it pleaſed him well to marry with a daughter of the uncircumciſed Philiſtines, becauſe he had a warrant from God thereby to pick a quarrell againſt them; but doubtleſſe he could not intend that his father, by thoſe words of his, ſhould think of any ſuch thing, but onely that he was pleaſed with her perſon, and had thereupon ſet his affection on her; yea it is evident that he did purpoſely conceal this from his parents, that he ſought an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt the Philiſtines, leſt that ſhould have made them the more eager to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him herein. Indeed it is ſtrange, that his godly parents ſhould yield (as we ſee verſ. 5. they did) to make ſuch a match for him with a Philiſtines daughter, onely becauſe he had a mind to her; but godly parents are many times too fond and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to their children, and ſo it ſeems it was with Manoah and his wife.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord that he ſought an occaſion,</hi> &amp;c.] This laſt clauſe many Expoſitours referre to the Lord, to wit, that he ſought an occcaſion againſt the Philiſtines, by ſuffering Samſon thus to

fall in love with a daughter of the Philiſtines; but firſt, becauſe if the meaning of theſe words had been, that the Lord ſought an occaſion againſt the Philiſtines, it might as well have been ſaid, that neither Samſon nor his parents <hi>knew it,</hi> as that <hi>his father and his mother knew it not:</hi> ſecondly, becauſe it is manifeſt in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of the ſtory, that Samſon did indeed ſeek an occaſion againſt the Philiſtines, as we may ſee by the riddle he propounded to them at the wedding, and his carefull concealing of that which he did to the lion from his very parents, that ſo the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his riddle might not be known; and eſpecially by that which he ſaid when he addreſſed himſelf to be revenged on the Philiſtines, becauſe his wife was given to another, chap. 15.3. Now ſaith he, <hi>ſhall I be more blameleſſe then the Philistines, though I do them a diſpleaſure:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, now have I gotten a juſt occaſion to be revenged on the Philiſtines: and thirdly, becauſe Samſon is numbred by the Apoſtle, Heb. 11.32. amongſt thoſe, that by faith did notably ſubdue the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God; which ſeems to imply, that he had a word and warrant from God for it, therefore I rather conceive, that the meaning of theſe words is, <hi>that his father and his mother knew not that that it was of the Lord, that he,</hi> that is, Samſon <hi>ſought an occaſion againſt the Philiſtines:</hi> and then it is manifeſt by this place, that Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon knew that it was Gods will, that by ſeeking a wife amongſt the Philiſtines, he ſhould take ſome occaſion to be revenged on them, though his parents thought not of any ſuch thing. But may ſome ſay, Conſidering that the Philiſtines were of thoſe nations whom God had commanded the Iſraelites utterly to deſtroy, and ſo to take their land into their poſſeſſion; and likewiſe, that the Philiſtines had for many years oppreſſed the Iſraelites, what need was there that Samſon ſhould ſeek any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion againſt them to be revenged on them? Now to this I anſwer, firſt, that it might well be, that the Iſraelites had by covenant ſubmitted themſelves to be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Philiſtines, and in that regard Samſon was to ſeek an occaſion againſt them, that he might without breach of covenant be revenged on them, and thence it may be, that thoſe words are added immediately upon theſe, <hi>for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Iſrael:</hi> and ſecondly, that Samſon not being called of God to undertake the reſcuing of the Iſraelites in a publick way out of the power of the Philiſtines, by raiſing up an army againſt them, but being onely appointed in his own perſon to make havock amongſt them, and by that means to weaken their power, and abate their pride; he was in that regard to take occaſion from ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſonall wrong, to ſet upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And behold, a young lyon roared against him,</hi> &amp;c.] Either therefore Samſon was upon ſome occaſion turned out of the way, or elſe his parents being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or behind, Samſon was at preſent going alone by himſelf; and thus God encouraged him for thoſe encounters againſt the Philiſtines, which afterwards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; as David was prepared in the like kind to fight with Goliah, 1. Sam. 17.36. <hi>Thy ſervant ſlew both the lyon and the beare: and this uncircumciſed Philiſtine ſhall be as one of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, on a ſudden the Lord by his Spirit did endue him with ſuch an exceeding meaſure of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſtrength, that though <hi>he had nothing in his hand,</hi> not ſo much as a ſtaff to defend himſelf, yet with his naked hands he ſaid hold on the lion, <hi>and rent him as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42229:89"/>
he would have rent a kid;</hi> and herein was Samſon a notable type of Chriſt in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over the devil, that <hi>roaring lion,</hi> as S. Peter calls him, 1. Pet. 5.8. that is continually <hi>walking about, ſeeking whom he may devoure.</hi> As for that which is added in the next words, that <hi>he told not his father or his mother what he had done;</hi> the reaſon of this might be, leſt it ſhould prove perillous to have the Philiſtines heare of an Iſraelite endued with ſuch admirable proweſſe and ſtrength; but withall it was an argument of Samſons ſingular modeſty, that having performed ſuch a ſtrange and heroicall exploit, he could preſently go away after his parents, and when he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them, never ſpake the leaſt word to them of it; and herein too was there ſome ſhadow of that which is related concerning Chriſt, that when he had wrought many miraculous works, did often give charge that there ſhould be no ſpeech of it; as when he had cured a blind man, <hi>he ſent him away to his houſe, ſaying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town,</hi> Mark 8.26.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And it came to paſſe when they ſaw him, that they brought thirty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to be with him.]</hi> The moſt of Expoſitours by farre, underſtand this place thus, That when the Philiſtines ſaw Samſon, perceiving him to be a man of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtrength, and full of terrour, they brought thirty companions to be with him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of reſpect, and the cuſtome of their marriage ſolemnity, but indeed that they might ſet a guard upon him, leſt he ſhould ſuddenly do them any miſchief. But firſt, becauſe they had ſeen him before, and were not then affraid of him: ſecondly, the Scripture doth not any where make the leaſt mention of any thing extraordinary in Samſons body, or the terrour of his countenance; but aſcribes his ſtrength merely to the coming of Gods ſpirit upon him: and thirdly, Samſon by the guidance no doubt of Gods ſpirit, purpoſely concealed the killing of the lion, that the Philiſtines might not be afraid of him: therefore I think it farre more probable, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words is onely this, that when the brides friends and kindred ſaw that Samſon was come to take his wife, they provided thirty young men, according to the cuſtome of thoſe times, as his companions and bridemen, <hi>children of the bride-chamber,</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:42229:90"/>
as they are called, Matt. 9.15. to attend upon him, and to rejoyce with him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And Samſon ſaid unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you,</hi> &amp;c.] It was it ſeems the cuſtome of thoſe times by way of exerciſing their wits, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at feaſts to ſtrive for the maſterie one with another, in point of reſolving dark and intricate queſtions and riddles, whereto ſome apply that, 1. Kings 10.1. that <hi>when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, concerning the name of the Lord, ſhe came to prove him with hard queſtions;</hi> and ſo hereupon it was that Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the firſt day of his wedding feaſt propounded a riddle to his bride-men; however his aim doubtleſſe therein was to take an occaſion of picking a quarrell with the Philiſtines; to which ſome Expoſitours do adde this too, that as Samſon in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with a daughter of the Philiſtines was a type of Chriſt in his calling the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to be his people, and ſo marrying them to himſelf as his bride and ſpouſe; ſo alſo this riddle propounded by Samſon was a figure of the doctrine of the Goſpel, publiſhed to the world by Chriſt, when the time of the calling of the Gentiles was come, which indeed was a riddle to fleſh and bloud, according to that of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 1.23. <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſſe:</hi> as concerning the ſeven dayes of the wedding feaſt here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ſee the note Gen. 29.27. and concerning the thirty change of garments which is a part of the wager propounded by Samſon, ſee the note Gen. 45 22.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth ſweetneſſe.]</hi> The honey which Samſon found in the carcaſe of the lion was the ground of this riddle; but withall we may well think, that meditating by himſelf concerning this obſervable paſſage of Gods providence, in yielding him food to eat out of the carcaſe of that lion that a while before thought to have eaten up him, he called to mind how uſually God is wont after the ſame manner for his children, to bring them good out of evil; &amp; ſo did the rather propound this riddle becauſe it was a notable enigmaticall expreſſion of Gods dealing with his people in this regard. For when Satans temptations, yea the ſinnes of the godly turn to their advantage, what is this but honey out of that roaring lion that ſeeks to devoure us? When the cruell enemies of Gods people are made their friends, or that God turns their malicious practiſes to the furtherance of the Goſpel and the good of the Church, what is this but meat out of the eater? When afflictions, yea death it ſelf yields matter of much ſweet comfort to the godly, and opens a way to a better life for them, what is this but ſweetneſſe drawn forth for them out of the carcaſe, as it were, of their ſtrong enemies. Yea principally did this ſhadow forth that myſterie of the ſweet and ſaving food of our ſouls in the miniſterie of the Goſpel, which we have from Chriſts victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie over hell and death, by his own death, according to that of the Apoſtle, Heb. 2.17. <hi>Foraſmuch therefore as the children are partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took a part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil:</hi> and that of our Saviour, John 6.51. <hi>I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread he ſhall live for ever, and the bread that I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> The more unexpectedly good comes to us out of evil, the more thankfull his people muſt needs be for it; and therefore God loves to ſtore up comforts, where his people would leaſt expect to find them.</p>

                     <hi>And they could not in three dayes expound the riddle.]</hi> And thus it was with the Philiſtines, as it is with all other naturall men in regard of the myſterie of the Goſpel which Chriſt hath publiſhed to the world; they are not able by any wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and endeavours of their own to comprehend it, unleſſe by the ſpirit of God it be revealed to them, according to that of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 2.14, 15. <hi>The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him, neither can he know them becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned; but he that is ſpirituall judgeth all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And it came to paſſe that on the ſeventh day they ſaid unto Samſons wife, Entice thy husband,</hi> &amp;c.] Two paſſages in this ſtory make it evident, that theſe men ſet the bride on work upon the fourth day, to trie underhand if ſhe could get the meaning of the riddle from him: firſt, becauſe it is ſaid verſ. 14. that <hi>they could not in three dayes expound the riddle;</hi> which implyes, that ſo long onely of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they tried to find it out, and then began on the fourth day to take another courſe, to wit, to perſwade his wife to get it from him: ſecondly, becauſe it is ſaid, verſ. 17. that <hi>ſhe wept before him the ſeven dayes while the feaſt laſted:</hi> which ſhews that ſhe began to preſſe her husband about this, before the ſeventh day came. The meaning therefore ſeems to be this, that three dayes they aſſayed of their own heads to find out the meaning of the riddle, but then beginning to ſuſpect themſelves, on the fourth day they perſwaded his wife to ſee if ſhe could fiſh it out of him; but when the ſeventh day came, deſpairing to find it out of themſelves, they came again, and by threatning ſpeeches laboured to terrifie his wife, that ſo ſhe might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to uſe all her skill to wring it from him: <hi>entice thy husband</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that he may declare unto us the riddle, leſt we burn thee and thy fathers houſe with fire:</hi> Indeed it is not likely that they durſt have proceeded to ſuch an outrage upon ſo weak and triviall a ground, onely they ſpeak this to ſcare the timerous woman, that ſhe might be the more importunate with her husband.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and ſhall I tell it thee?]</hi> Though a wife be nearer to a man then his parents, and therefore may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him more freedome in the communication of his ſecrets; yet here Samſon conſiders the reverence that was due to his parents, and the long experience that he had of their faithfulneſſe, in both which reſpects there was more reaſon he ſhould have told it them then her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And ſhe wept before him the ſeven dayes while the feaſt laſted.]</hi> This may be meant of the remainder of the ſeven dayes after his companions had ſet her to win it from him, that from that time ſhe wept to the end of the ſeven dayes; yet it is likely, that from the firſt, out of her own deſire to know it, ſhe was importunate with him. See the note above verſ. 15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.]</hi> Theſe words, <hi>If ye had not plowed with my heifer,</hi> ſeems to implie ſome jealous thoughts in Samſon, of ſome ſecret and unchaſt dealing of the Philiſtines with his wife; whom therefore in regard of her ſuſpected wantonneſſe he calls his heifer; and if ſo it were with Samſon, no marvell though in his jealouſie his ſpirit was ſtirred up with great indignation againſt them. But however, becauſe by plowing the earth is opened, and that diſcovered which was hidden before, as in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42229:91"/>
that regard a man may be ſaid to dig for a ſecret, ſo alſo to plow for it, and ſo the meaning of theſe words may be onely this, that if they had not by the help of his wiſe ſought out and diſcovered the meaning of his riddle, they had never found it out.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And he went down to Aſhkelon, and ſlew thirty men of them,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Expoſitours have ſought what might be imagined concerning the cauſe why Samſon paſſed over ſo many places where the Philiſtines dwelt, and went to Aſhkelon to fetch this ſpoil, which was ſo farre off from Timnath; as that there was there ſome ſolemne aſſembly of the Philiſtines held, &amp;c. But it ſufficeth us to know that by the Spirit of God he was carried thither, and the cauſe being not expreſſed, why ſhould we enquire after it? As for the ſpoil he took from the Philiſtines he there ſlew, we muſt know, that though they that took upon them the vow of a Nazarite onely for a time, might not come at any dead body, Numb. 6.6. <hi>All the dayes he ſeparateth himſelf unto the Lord, he ſhall come at no dead body.</hi> And if they were caſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by any ſuch means, they were anew to begin the dayes of their conſecration; yet thoſe that were ſet apart of God to be perpetuall Nazarites, were not it ſeems tyed to theſe things, to wit, becauſe they could not alwayes avoid them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what Samſon did, he did by the ſpeciall motion of Gods Spirit; and therefore he made no ſcruple of taking the garments of theſe ſlain men, which he gave to his companions; and under them muſt be comprehended the ſheets or ſhirts alſo mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the bargain they made, verſ. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his fathers houſe.]</hi> In his anger leaving his wife behind him.</p>

Some alſo adde that it was he that was choſen to be the firſt of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the next to the bridegroom himſelf, who according to the cuſtome of thoſe times, was called the bridegrooms friend: to which cuſtome they ſay the Baptiſt doth allude, John 3.29. <hi>He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly becauſe of the bridegrooms voice.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And Samſon went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,</hi> &amp;c.] It appears by many places of Scripture, that there were great ſtore of foxes in the land of Canaan; for hence are thoſe expreſſions, Cant. 2.15. <hi>Take us the foxes,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42229:91"/>
the little foxes, that spoil the vines:</hi> and Pſal. 63.9, 10. <hi>But thoſe that ſeek my ſoul to deſtroy it—they ſhall fall by the ſword, they ſhall be a portion for foxes:</hi> and again, Neh. 4.3. <hi>Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he ſhall even break down their ſtone wall.</hi> Now conſidering that this countrey did ſo abound with fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and that withall it was ſummer time, <hi>wheat harveſt,</hi> verſ. 1. when foxes, becauſe they are fat, are the more eaſily taken, it is not a matter of ſo great wonder, that Samſon ſhould take three hundred foxes, eſpecially if withall we do obſerve, that it is not expreſſed, either how long they were taking, or whether he took them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, or by the help of others. But however, the Lord that put him upon this way of revenge, could eaſily ſupply him with this number of foxes in a ſhort time: <hi>The wild beasts of the field are his,</hi> Pſal. 50.11. and if we remember how by the al-ruling providence of God, there came in of all kinds of living creatures to Noah, that they might be preſerved in the ark, Gen. 6.20. and how ſuch a multitude of quailes were brought in to the Iſraelites, Num. 11.31. it will not ſurely ſeem incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that with the ſpeciall help of Gods providence, Samſon ſhould by nets or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, take three hundred foxes within ſome ſhort time. Now for the exploit he performed with theſe foxes, it is punctually here expreſſed, and the reaſon of each particular we may thus conceive: firſt he made choice to do it with foxes rather then dogs, &amp;c. becauſe they are creatures that ſtill ſeek to hide themſelves, and to lie lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſecret places, and therefore being let looſe, eſpecially being ſcared with the fire at their tails, were like to runne into the ſhocks, and ſtanding corn, which being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ripe, would ſoon be ſet on a light flame, and ſo they would be ſcared too from one place to another: ſecondly, he did not let looſe each fox ſingle with a firebrand or torch tied to his tail (for the word in the originall ſignifieth both <hi>a firebrand</hi> and <hi>a torch</hi>) becauſe then they might have runne ſpeedily into their holes, and the brands or torches drawn on the ground through dirt or water would ſoon have been quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but he tied two foxes together, tail to tail, and a firebrand or a torch between their tails, and ſo the foxes could not fly ſpeedily away, but muſt needs go ſtragling up and down, one drawing one way, and another another way, and the brands or torches were for the moſt part born above ground, that they might not be quenched: and thirdly, though the corn might have been ſet on fire without this, yet it pleaſed the Lord to direct Samſon to do it this way, that their puniſhment coming upon them in ſuch a ridiculous way, and by an act of ſuch ſcorn, even this might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſome aggravation of their miſery. And then again we have by this means in this exploit of Samſons, a notable figure of the diviſions that are uſually amongſt the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty adverſaries of Gods people, hereticks eſpecially, whereby Chriſt accompliſheth what he foretold, Luke 12.49. <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth, and what will I if it be already kindled?</hi> Hereticks are like foxes cunning and crafty, hurtfull to the places where they live, and noiſome by reaſon of their unſavory and abominable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; yea they are like foxes tied tail to tail with firebrands betwixt their tails, they differ in many things and cannot agree, one draws one way &amp; another another: onely in this they agree together, that they are all incendiaries, that where ever they come ſet all on a light flame, and ſo prove the deſtruction of the places where they live; yea, thus it is uſually with all other the enemies of Chriſt and his people, the Lord uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly letting looſe ſome ſuch amongſt them, that will be ſure to make diviſions where
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42229:92"/>
they come, that ſo by a fire of diſcord amongſt themſelves they may be devoured through Gods juſt judgement upon them, that ſought ſo unjuſtly to devoure Gods people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the Philiſtines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.]</hi> And thus that fell upon Samſons wife, which by evill means ſhe ſought to avoid, when at her wedding ſhe was threatned with burning, chap. 14.15. <hi>Entice thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy fathers houſe with fire:</hi> according to that of Solomon, Prov. 10.24. <hi>The fear of the wicked, it ſhall come upon him:</hi> and withall, both ſhe and her father were juſtly deſtroyed, for breaking the bond of marriage betwixt her and Samſon.</p>

This I conceive to be the meaning of this proverbiall ſpeech, <hi>he ſmote them hip and thigh;</hi> though others expound it that he ſmote both horſmen and footmen, as we may ſee in the margin of our Geneva bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; but that cannot be the meaning of it according to our tranſlation.</p>

                     <hi>And he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.]</hi> A place belonging to the tribe of Simeon, whoſe lot was within the land of Judah, 1. Chron. 4.32. called alſo Ether. Joſh. 19.7. It ſeems it was a place of ſome ſtrength (and therefore fortified and made a city of defence by Rehoboam) 2. Chron. 11.5, 6. <hi>Rehoboam dwelt in Jeruſalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. He built Bethlehem and Etam</hi>) and that therefore Samſon went thither, as expecting the Philiſtines would come up againſt him; yet not to ſecure himſelf from the Philiſtines, as being afraid of them; but rather leſt (as it proved) his brethren the Iſraelites, being enraged for his provoking the Philiſtines againſt them, ſhould attempt to offer him any violence, and ſo he ſhould be conſtrained to ſtand upon his guard againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then the Philiſtines went up and pitched in Judah, and ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Lehi.]</hi> That is, in a place afterward called Lehi, which ſignifieth a jaw-bone, and that by occaſion of the exploit done there by Samſon with the jaw-bone of an aſſe, verſ 17. <hi>And it came to paſſe, when he had made an end of speaking, that he caſt away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-Lehi.</hi> As for this phraſe, <hi>and spread themſelves in Lehi,</hi> it is purpoſely uſed to imply how great an army of the Philiſtines it was that came up againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Swear unto me that you will not fall upon me your ſelves.]</hi> Thus by yielding up himſelf to be bound by them, that he might be delivered to the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42229:92"/>
he diſcovered how carefull he was, that the Philiſtines ſhould not hurt the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites for his ſake, and by agreeing before-hand with them, that they ſhould not fall upon him themſelves, he ſought to prevent the danger of being conſtrained to reſiſt them, or do them any hurt in his own defence.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.]</hi> And herein was Samſon a type of Chriſt, that was bound by the Jews his own brethren, and ſo delivered up to Pilate and the Romans, Matth. 27.2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the cords that were upon his hands, became as flax,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus our Saviour alſo, of whom Samſon was a type, being by the treachery of the Jews, the people whom he came to ſave, yea his own diſciples, delivered over into the hands of his enemies, and ſo to death, Matth. 26.21, <hi>And as they did eat, he ſaid, Verily, one of you ſhall betray me:</hi> yet not without his voluntary yielding thereto, Joh. 10.18. <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf:</hi> the pains of death could not hold him, Acts 2.24. but he roſe again, and by the <hi>jaw-bone of an aſſe,</hi> that is, weak and contemptible means in the eye of reaſon, <hi>the fooliſhneſſe of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.21. he beat down the kingdome of Satan before him, and hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the world under him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And he was ſore a thirſt, and he called on the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] How ſore Samſons thirſt was, appears in this, that he was alſo through faintneſſe ready to die, and ſo not able to ſtirre from the place where he was, to ſeek water elſe where. Though therefore his thirſt and faintneſſe, might partly proceed in a naturall way, from the violent ſtirring of himſelf, in ſuch an extraordinary work as this was, of ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thouſand Philiſtines with the jaw-bone of an aſſe; yet we may well think that there was a ſpeciall hand of God beſides in it: firſt, that he might herein, as in many other things, be a type of Chriſt, who in the heat of his agony upon the croſſe, and when he had now in a manner vanquiſhed all the powers of hell and death, did alſo cry out of thirſt, John 19.28. <hi>After this, Jeſus knowing that all things were now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ſaith, I thirſt:</hi> and ſecondly, that he might hereby ſee his own weakneſſe, and ſo might be kept from being proud of his former victories, and might be taught to acknowledge, that it was merely of God that he had thus beaten down his proud enemes before him: and thus indeed God is uſually wont to humble his ſervants when they have done any memorable act, that they may not be puffed up therewith, as ſeeing how weak they are in themſelves, if they had not been endued with power from on high; as for the words here which Samſon ſpake when he cryed upon. God in his thirſt, <hi>Thou haſt given this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance into the hand of thy ſervant, and now ſhall I die for thirſt,</hi> &amp;c. therein, firſt, he doth not onely intimate his aſſurance that God would not now ſuffer him to periſh, and that becauſe God had ſo miraculouſly enabled him to deſtroy his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but even from this he pleads with God for help, as concluding, that all this great work would, come to nothing if after all this he ſhould periſh for thirſt, and ſo ſhould fall into the hands of the Philiſtines: and ſecondly, he intimates, that it was in Gods ſervice that he had thus wearied himſelf, and thereupon deſires the Lord to remember him in this his extremity. For ſo much is clearly enough implyed in thoſe words, <hi>thy ſervant. Thou haſt given this great deliverance into the hand of thy ſervant, and now ſhall I die for thirſt?</hi> For indeed, as long as men are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42229:93"/>
in Gods ſervice, they may boldly call upon God in all their wants and need, not doubting but he will ſupplie them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout,</hi> &amp;c.] Some reade this place as it is in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>But God clave an hollow place that was in Lehi, and there came water thereout:</hi> So that the meaning may be, either that God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw-bone of the aſſe, wherewith Samſon had before made ſuch havock amongſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines; or elſe, that God clave ſome hollow place in that field, which in memorie of this miraculous act of his done with an aſſes jaw-bone, he had called Lehi, that is, <hi>the jaw-bone:</hi> and ſo accordingly alſo, we muſt underſtand the laſt words of this verſe, <hi>wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkor,</hi> that is, <hi>the well of him that called or cryed, which is in Lehi unto this day,</hi> to wit, either that Samſon called that particular place where the water came out of the jaw-bone, Enhakkor, and that this place hence called Enhakkor, was in that field or tract of ground, which he had formerly called Lehi; or elſe, that Samſon called the fountain, which ſprung out of the hollow place in Lehi, Enhakkor; and that this well, or ſpring of water continued afterwards, and was to be ſeen in Lehi, at the time when this Hiſtorie was written: and indeed, becauſe the words do ſeem plainly to implie, that there was a well or ſpring that continued in that place called Enhakkor, that is, <hi>the well of him that called</hi> or <hi>cryed:</hi> (inſomuch that ſome hold that the water which God miraculouſly gave Samſon for the quenching of his thirſt, was a well that ſprung out of the earth, onely it came through the tooth, or the hollow place where the tooth had been in the aſſes jaw) therefore I rather think that God clave an hollow place in the field called Lehi, whence a fountain ſprung called Enhakkor; which continued untill the time of writing this Hiſtorie; then that it was an hollow place out of the very jaw-bone of the aſſe, out of which God brought water, that Samſon might drink thereof and be refreſhed.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen went Samſon to Gaza, and ſaw there an harlot, and went in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.)</hi> This mention that is made of his ſeeing the harlot, to whom he went in, implies, that he went not thither for that purpoſe, but going ſecretly thither with ſome other intent, he was on a ſudden intangled with the ſight of this harlot, and ſo drawn to commit folly with her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And they compaſſed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, hearing by ſome that had taken notice of him, that he was come into the citie, but not knowing into what houſe he was entred, they took order that the gates ſhould be ſhut, and narrowly watched, to make ſure that he ſhould not eſcape away in the night, and then at each gate, eſpecially at that gate out of which his way lay, being to go to his own countrey, they ſet certain men who ſhould the next morning diligently wait for him, and as he came out, ſhould ſuddenly kill him, as being afraid any other way to ſet upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Samſon lay till midnight, and aroſe at midnight, and took the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42229:93"/>
doors of the gate of the city,</hi> &amp;c.] Knowing it ſeems by the ſecret inſtinct of Gods ſpirit, that he was deſcryed, and that there was wait laid for him, in the dead of the night he aroſe, and going to the gate of the city, which was faſt ſhut to prevent his eſcape, <hi>took the doors of the gate of the citie, and the two poſts, and went away with them, barre and all, and put them upon his ſhoulders, and carried them up to the top of the hill that is before Hebron,</hi> and it is thought by ſome, that Hebron was at leaſt ſeven Germane miles from Gaza, the citie whoſe gates he carried away, which was not farre from the ſea-coaſt; an act of the greateſt wonder that ever Samſon did, and wherein he was a notable type of Chriſt, in that glorious act of his reſurrection; when being ſhut up dead in the grave, the ſepulchre being ſealed, and a companie of ſouldiers ſet to watch it, notwithſtanding all theſe barres of death, <hi>becauſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid, Acts 2.24. <hi>it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it;</hi> early the next morning the ſtone was removed; and ſo he aroſe again by his own Almighty power, carrying away, as it were, the gates and poſts of hell and death, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while, aſcended up triumphantly into heaven. Indeed, it may ſeem very ſtrange, that Samſon ariſing newly from the bed of fornication, ſhould have ſuch wonderfull aſſiſtance from God, as to be enabled to do ſo glorious and admirable a work: but we muſt conſider, firſt, that God ſuffered his holy Nazarite to fall into this ſinne, to ſhew the weakneſſe of the beſt and ſtrongeſt, if left unto themſelves: ſecondly, that God is not wont alwayes to deal with his ſervants according to their ſinnes; nor preſently to withdraw the gifts of his Spirit, though they ſometimes greatly provoke him: and thirdly, that God had reſpect herein to glorifie himſelf, in this triumph of his ſervant over the Philiſtines, though afterwards he took his time to correct him, and that ſharply too for his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And it came to paſſe afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whoſe name was Delilah.]</hi> It is plainly enough implyed, though it be not expreſſed, that this Delilah was a Philiſtine Harlot, as the other was, and not his wife, or of the ſtock of Iſrael, as ſome have thought; firſt, becauſe this ſtory is ſo immediately brought in, juſt as another ſtory of the like nature that went before; <hi>And it came to paſſe that afterward he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek,</hi> &amp;c. even as if it were purpoſely added to ſhew how prone the beſt are, if once intangled in this ſinne, to proceed ſtill to further degrees of uncleanneſſe; and what miſerie God ſuffered his progreſſe in this ſinne to bring upon him, though he ſpared him at firſt: ſecondly, becauſe the phraſe the Spirit of God here uſeth, <hi>he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek,</hi> doth not ſound as ſpoken of the love of a wife, but of the love of a harlot: thirdly, becauſe the free intercourſe that was betwixt her and the lords of the Philiſtines, and her hiding the Philiſtines that were to ſeize upon him, again and again in a chamber in her houſe, makes it clear, that Samſon was there as a ſtranger, not in his own houſe, and amongſt his own familie: and fourthly, becauſe her whoriſh; qualities in that ſhe was ſo readily wone by the hire of money to betray him into the hands of the Philiſtines, and that by dandling him upon her l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>p, doth proclaim her to have been neither wife, nor Iſraelite, but a Philiſtine and harlot.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Tell me I pray thee, wherein thy great ſtrength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.]</hi> She asked him this queſtion doubtleſſe in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42229:94"/>
ſuch a manner, that he might not ſuſpect any thought ſhe had of delivering him into the power of his enemies: It is likely, that with many flattering ſpeeches ſhe told him, how much not her ſelf onely, but the whole land of the Philiſtines were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, at the report of his admirable ſtrength; and thoſe wonders which he had wrought thereby amongſt them, and how happy ſhe thought her ſelf in having ſuch a lover, that was the wonder of the world for ſtrength of body; and then withall, as onely out of a deſire to ſatisfie her own curioſity (and the rather becauſe the great affection ſhe bore him, made her long to know as much as ſhe might concerning him) ſhe deſires him to tell her wherein his ſtrength lay, and whether any thing could weaken his ſtrength, and make him like other men.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And Samſon ſaid unto her, If they bind me with ſeven green withs,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus he anſwered her, thereby to evade the telling of that which he meant not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and that either as thinking ſhe would be ſatisfied with this anſwer, and not attempt to make proof whether it were ſo indeed or no; or elſe, as intending to make himſelf ſport with her, if ſhe would make triall of the truth of what he had told; but whilſt he thus dallies with her, and aſſayes to put her off with a jeaſt, and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deny her as he might have done, at laſt ſhe prevailed over him, and in good earneſt bound him, and delivered him up into the hands of the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.]</hi> They durſt not come near him to take him, no not when he was aſleep, no more then men dare venture upon a ſleeping lion; Delilah hid them therefore in ſome place near at hand, intending to call them forth, if ſhe found he could not break his bands, if otherwiſe to laugh it out, and make merry with him, as if all done, had been done in ſport, to ſee whether he had told her true.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Delilah ſaid unto Samſon, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: new tell me,</hi> &amp;c.] This doubtleſſe Delilah ſaid, not immediately upon his breaking the green withes, but at ſome other time; for had all this been done at one time, it might have bred ſome ſuſpition in Samſon; and beſides, it is evident ſhe did appoint the Philiſtines ſeverall times to come unto her, as we may ſee verſ. 18. <hi>And when Delilah ſaw that he had told her all his heart, ſhe ſent and called for the lords of the Philiſtines ſaying, Come up this once,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And he ſaid unto her, If they bind me with new ropes,</hi> &amp;c.] Though he had now found by experience that ſhe would not take what he ſaid for truth, but would try the truth of what he ſaid; yet either becauſe he was content to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſport in deluding her, or rather becauſe her importunity was ſuch, that without pretending to ſatisfie her, he could not be rid of her, (for that he was troubled with her importunity, is evident, verſ 16.) he again fained a falſe way how he might be bound; and ſo again a third time, verſ. 13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And ſhe faſtned it with the pin,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, having woven his locks with the web, and ſo rolled the web whereunto his locks were woven about the beam, as Samſon had appointed her, ſhe faſtned the beam with the pin, that ſo the beam might not turn back, when he ſhould lift up his head, &amp; then wakened him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>When ſhe preſſed him dayly with her words, and urged him ſo that his ſoul was vexed unto the death,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, either that through the diſtraction of his thoughts and affections, being exceeding loth to reveal this ſecret
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42229:94"/>
unto her, and yet as loth ſtill to deny her, he was indeed ready to faint, or at leaſt was even weary of his life, ſo that he had rather have died then have continued ſtill in ſuch perplexity; or rather, that it was even death to him to deny her any longer; eſpecially when ſhe began to upbraid him now with mocking her as he had done, and to challenge him that he did not love her, and ſo thereupon <hi>he told her all his heart,</hi> as it follows in the next verſe. Indeed conſidering the uſuall unfaithfulneſſe and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie of harlots, it is ſtrange, that neither her importunate deſiring to know a ſecret, the diſcoverie whereof might prove ſo perillous to him, nor her aſſaying three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times, to bind him in thoſe wayes which he had propounded, onely to deceive her, ſhould not make him begin to ſuſpect her, or fear ſome miſchief plotting againſt him; but for this we muſt remember, that the love of harlots doth uſually beſot men, and make them very ſlaves to thoſe their miſtreſſes; eſpecially when God intends to bring ſome miſchief upon them, as now he intended to have Samſon puniſhed for his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>If I be ſhaven then my ſtrength will go from me,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus Samſon at laſt told her the truth of that ſecret, which he was ſo loth to diſcloſe. Yet this was not becauſe his ſtrength proceeded from his long hair; (for it was merely the gift of God in a ſupernaturall way; and therefore, verſ. 20. where the reaſon is given, why he loſt his ſtrength upon the cutting of his hair; it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord was departed from him</hi>) nor was it, becauſe by the ordinary law of a Nazarite, if his head were ſhaven he was to loſe his ſtrength (for neither had all Nazarites this gift of ſuch admirable ſtrength as Samſon had, nor was there any ſuch thing in the law of the Nazarite, that thoſe that had their hair cut off, ſhould loſe ſuch gifts as God by his Spirit had conferred upon them): But it ſeems God had beſtowed this as a ſingular gift upon Samſon; and that upon condition of his ſtrict obſerving this law of the Nazarite, in keeping his hair uncut (to wit, that he might be herein a type of Chriſt, in regard of his invincible ſtrength, and to ſignifie alſo that the Spirit of grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived from Chriſt to his members, is <hi>a Spirit of power,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.7.) and it ſeems too, either by revelation or otherwiſe, God had expreſſely declared thus much to Samſon; and hence it was, that he told Delilah now, that if he were ſhaven, he ſhould become weak like any other man.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>When Delilah ſaw that he had told her all his heart,</hi> &amp;c.] Before ſhe perſwaded her ſelf, or was at leaſt in great hopes that he had dealt truly with her; but now it ſeems, ſhe might perceive by his countenance, geſture, and the manner of his expreſſing himſelf, that he did indeed tell her the truth from his heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then the Lords of the Philiſtines came up to her, and brought money in their hand.)</hi> That is, the money promiſed, verſ. 5. that is, each of them eleven hundred pieces of ſilver, which was five thouſand and five hundred pieces of ſilver, if there were <hi>five Lords of the Philistines,</hi> as afterwards, 1. Sam. 6.16. it is ſaid there were. Perhaps they conceited that hitherto ſhe had dallied with them, becauſe ſhe ſaw not the reward promiſed tendered to her, and therefore they brought the money now with them the more ſtrongly to tempt her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ, 19. <hi>And ſhe began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.]</hi> That is, ſhe ſhock him to awake him out of his ſleep, and ſcared him with crying out as formerly, <hi>the Philiſtines be upon thee Samſon;</hi> yea, it is likely that ſhe bound him
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42229:95"/>
whilſt he ſlept: for how elſe could ſhe perceive that his ſtrength was gone from him, that ſhe might call the Philiſtines that were lying in wait to come in and ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And he wiſt not that the Lord was departed from him.]</hi> To wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on a ſudden, at his firſt waking, he perceived not that his locks were cut off. As for this expreſſion, <hi>the Lord was departed from him,</hi> thereby onely is meant, that God had withdrawn himſelf from yielding him that ſupernaturall ſtrength, which formerly he had given him; for it is evident, that it cannot be underſtood of the totall loſſe of Gods favour, or the graces of his ſanctifying Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>But the Philiſtines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus no doubt, God by his providence did diſpoſe of it, that his eyes might firſt ſmart for his ſinnes, by means whereof he was firſt intangled and drawn into ſinne; and that thither he might be carried away captive, where firſt his luſtfull eyes had made him a ſlave to an harlot. As for the Philiſtines, firſt they put out his eyes onely by way of revenge, and to make ſure he might not hurt them, if he recovered his ſtrength: ſecondly, they carryed him to Gaza, a ſea coaſt town, becauſe being carried ſo farre through the land of the Philiſtines, the more of the people might come out to ſee him, and rejoyce in the ſhamefull captivitie of that their invincible enemie: thirdly, becauſe he ſhould be there furtheſt out of the reach of the Iſraelites, if they ſhould think to attempt his reſcue: and fourthly, that they might wipe off the ſtain of that diſhonour, which lately he had there done them; by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as a priſoner through that gate, which he had ere while to their great infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, taken up in his arms and carryed away. As for their putting him to <hi>grind in the priſon houſe,</hi> that was according to the cuſtome of thoſe times: for then, it ſeems, they would not ſuffer their priſoners to live idely, but made them grind at the mill; and thence is that expreſſion, where Babylons captivitie is threatned, Iſa. 47.2. <hi>Take the milſtones and grind meal, uncover thy locks, make bare the leg,</hi> &amp;c. Yet withall it is likely, they chuckered themſelves, to think what good uſe they ſhould make herein of his great ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again, after he was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.]</hi> This ſhews that Samſon was kept a good while in priſon, ere he was brought out to this their ſolemne feſtivitie; and it is noted, not as if his ſtrength lay merely in the length of his hair, but to implie his repentance, the reaſſuming of his vow of the Nazarite, which he had broken, the recoverie of Gods former favour, and the reſtoring of his former ſtrength, together with the ſigne of his reaſſumed vow, his Nazarites hair.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Then the Lords of the Philistines gathered themſelves together, for to offer a great ſacrifice unto Dagon their god.]</hi> This Dagon was an idol-god amongſt the Philiſtines, and his image was in the upper part like a man, and in the nether part like a fiſh (as many gather from 1. Sam. 5.4. concerning which ſee the note upon that place) and that, becauſe happely the Philiſtines, whoſe land lay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together on the ſea-coaſt, did worſhip him as the god of the ſea; he had a temple in Aſhdod, 1. Sam. 5.4. And by this which is ſaid here, that all the lords of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines met here together, from all the ſeverall lordſhips of their countrey, to offer a great ſacrifice to Dagon; to wit, for delivering Samſon into their hands; it ſeems he had another temple in Gaza too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42229:95"/>Verſ. 25. <hi>And they called for Samſon out of the priſon houſe, and he made them ſport.]</hi> To wit, paſſively, as being abuſed, derided, buffered, and happely forced to run up and down, that he might daſh his head againſt the pillars; yea, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by ſuffering whatever ſuch a poore blind priſoner can expect from enraged, proud, inſulting enemies, when they were now fluſhed with wine and good chear; and herein was Samſon alſo a type of Chriſt; for thus did they ſport themſelves with our Saviour, Matth. 26, 67, 68. <hi>Then did they ſpit in his face and buffeted him, and others ſmote him with the palms of their hands: Saying, Prophecie unto us, thou Christ, who is he that ſmote thee:</hi> and Matth. 27.29. <hi>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, ſaying, Hail King of the Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they ſet him between the pillars.]</hi> To wit, becauſe there he might be moſt conveniently ſeen by the princes and people that were met together; but withall, by the ſecret providence of God this was ſo ordered, that he might by thruſting away thoſe pillars, pull down the houſe upon the heads of the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the houſe ſtandeth, that I may lean upon them.]</hi> This he ſpake to the lad that led him, that the lad might think it was onely wearineſſe; partly through his continuall grinding at the mill, and partly through their turmoyling him at preſent to make themſelves ſport, that made him now deſire to reſt his hands upon the two pillars.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And ſtrengthen me, I pray thee, onely this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philiſtines for my two eyes.]</hi> Thus by his calling upon God for help, it was evident, that he relyed not upon his grown hair, but expected the renewing of his ſtrength merely from God, Neither did Samſon by ſeeking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his own wrong, take Gods work out of his hand; contrary to that precept, Rom. 12.19. <hi>Avenge not your ſelves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it, ſaith the Lord;</hi> and that becauſe he was a publick perſon raiſed of God, to puniſh thoſe that wronged his people; and beſides, what he did now, it is likely, he did it by the ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And Samſon ſaid, Let me die with the Philiſtines, and he bowed himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] This is onely an expreſſion of his contempt of death, upon this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that he ſhould execute ſuch a remarkable judgement upon the Philiſtines. His primary and direct intention was not ſuch as is theirs that make away them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but his direct aim was to deſtroy the Philiſtines; onely he was content to loſe his life in an action ſo advantageous to the people of God, and whereby he ſhould give ſuch a deadly blow to their enemies; which is expreſſed in the following words; <hi>ſo that the dead which he ſlew at his death, were mo then they that he ſlew in his life;</hi> and herein doubtleſſe, he was a type of Chriſt, who by death overcame death, Heb. 2.14. <hi>And him that had the power of death, which is the devil.</hi> To which ſome adde alſo, that dying thus, with one hand reaching out to one pillar, and the other to another, and ſo bowing himſelf, he did the more fitly ſhadow forth Chriſt dying with his hands ſtretched out upon the croſſe; John 19.30. <hi>When Jeſus therefore had received the vineger, he ſaid, It is finiſhed, and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghoſt.</hi>

But for this we muſt conſider; firſt, that happely the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines did not know, or would not acknowledge that this houſe fell by Samſons means, but rather by ſome other caſualty: ſecondly, that the power of the Philiſtines, as alſo their pride and wrath againſt Gods people, muſt needs by this fatall blow gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all their princes, and ſo many of the people, be much abated and pulled down, ſo that this was no time to domineer over the Iſraelites, or to provoke them by any harſh anſwer, but rather to provide by all means for their own ſafety: thirdly, that the hearts of all men are in Gods hands: Prov. 16.1. <hi>The preparations of the heart of man, and the anſwer of the tongue, is from the Lord:</hi> who might therefore move them to yield Samſons body to his brethren, as he did Pilate to yield to the like ſuit concerning Chriſt, John 19.38. <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea (being a diſciple of Jeſus but ſecretly for fear of the Jews) beſought Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jeſus; and Pilate gave him leave.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd there was a man of mount Ephraim,</hi> &amp;c.] All the particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages related from hence to the end of this book, were certainly in the time of ſome of the forementioned Judges, &amp; that not long too after the death of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, and not according to the order of time, as they are here inſerted, after the death of Samſon. Concerning which ſee the note upon verſ. 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And he ſaid unto his mother, The eleven hundred ſhekels of ſilver, that were taken from thee, about which thou curſedſt.</hi> &amp;c.] To wit either by curſing thoſe that had ſtolen it, through the violence of her paſſion; or by adjuring thoſe ſhe ſpake to under a curſe to reveal what was become of it, if they knew any thing of it. Now the bitterneſſe of his mothers ſpirit in curſing thus, was doubtleſſe the greater, becauſe ſhe had ſuperſtitiouſly devoted it to a religious uſe, to wit, the making of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages for her ſonne. But yet Micah mentions it as being touched in conſcience by way of aggravating his ſinne, &amp; implying the reaſon why he could no longer detain it, In mine own hearing, ſaith he, thou didſt curſe thoſe that had taken thy ſilver from thee, or that did not diſcover where it was, yet wretch as I am, hitherto I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, but no longer dare I lie under a mothers curſe, and therefore am I now come to confeſſe my ſinne, and to reſtore again the money to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his mother ſaid, Bleſſed be thou of the Lord, my ſonne.]</hi> That is, free be thou from my curſe, my ſonne and mayſt thou be bleſſed of the Lord, and not curſed, becauſe thou haſt repented of this fact, and ſo ingeniouſly doſt offer to reſtore, what unadviſedly before thou hadſt taken away from me.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>His mother ſaid, I had wholly dedicated the ſilver unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Micahs mother here tells him, that ſhe <hi>had wholly dedicated the ſilver unto the Lord,</hi> Jehovah as it is in the Hebrew, and yet withall ſhe addes, that it was to make idols for him, <hi>to make a graven image and a molten image;</hi> whereby it is evident, that in theſe times, when many of the Iſraelites were become idolaters, yet they pretended and intended the worſhip of the true God in their idol-ſervice, not eſteeming thoſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42229:96"/>
dumb and dead images gods, but onely repreſentations and remembrances of the true God. Some queſtion whether this which ſhe ſpake, of <hi>a graven image, and a molten image,</hi> was meant of two ſeverall images, that ſhe intended ſhould be made of her ſilver, one graven and another molten; or of one image which is called a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a molten image, onely becauſe they did melt their ſilver, and caſt it into the form of an image, and then did afterwards poliſh and finiſh it with graving tools; but that two ſeverall images are here intended, is evident in the following chapter, verſ. 18. where it is plain that they are named ſeverally, <hi>And theſe went into Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cahs houſe, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the Teraphim, and the mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten image.</hi>

Kings 23.24. <hi>Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and the images,</hi> (the teraphim it is in the originall) <hi>and the idols, and all the abominations that were ſpied in the land of Judah, and in Jeruſalem, did Joſiah put away.</hi> It ſeems they had the ſhape of men: 1. Sam. 19.13. <hi>And Michael took an image and laid in the bed</hi> (for there alſo Michaels image is in the originall called <hi>teraphim</hi>) and that they made uſe of them as oracles, and received from them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers what to do in doubtfull caſes: Ezek. 21.21. <hi>The king of Babylon ſtood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two wayes, to uſe divination: he made his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows bright he conſulted with images,</hi> or teraphim: Zach. 10.2. <hi>The idols</hi> (or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim) <hi>have ſpoken vanity, and the diviners have ſeen a lie, and have told falſe dreams:</hi> and it may well be, that this made the Danites enquire at Micahs houſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſucceſſe of their journey.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>In thoſe dayes there was no king in Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in thoſe dayes when Micah did this before related: But when was this? The time is not expreſſely ſet down; ſome conceive this was done after Samſons death, and that therefore it is next related in the courſe of the hiſtory; but the moſt probable opinion is, that both this, and all that followeth to the end of this book, were done long before Samſons death, and are here onely related apart by themſelves, that the ſtory of the Judges, the main thing intended in the former part of the book, might not be interrupted: firſt, becauſe it is not probable that the Danites being a populous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

enlarge their borders, which how they did, and how they ſtole away Micahs gods, is related in the following chapter But eſpecially becauſe in the warre of Iſrael againſt Benjamin (which is largely related in the three laſt chapters of this book) Phinehas miniſtred before the Lord, chap. 20.28. <hi>And Phinehas the ſonne of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azar, the ſonne of Aaron, ſtood before it in thoſe dayes, ſaying, Shall I yet again go out to battel againſt the children of Benjamin my brother,</hi> who killed Zimri and Cozbi, Numb. 25.7. above three hundred years before Samſons death: It ſeems therefore, either this was done immediately after the death of Joſhua, and thoſe elders, who all their time kept the people from revolting from God, Judg. 2.7. <hi>And the people ſerved the Lord all the dayes of Joſhua, and and all the dayes of the elders that outlived Joſhua; who had ſeen all the great works of the Lord which he did for Iſrael:</hi> and then the meaning of the words may be <hi>(there was no King in Iſrael)</hi> that there was no ordinary ſupreme magiſtrate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King nor Judge, to reſtrain the people from theſe wicked courſes, or elſe that it was done in the time of ſome of the Judges, that followed next after Joſhua; and then the meaning of the words muſt be, that <hi>in thoſe dayes there was no King in Iſrael;</hi> that is, no ſupreme Magiſtrate armed with ſuch ſovereigne authoritie, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh offenders that tranſgreſſed the law, as the Kings afterwards had; the Judges ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther governing the people by counſell, ſhewing them what was the law and will of God, then by the ſword of juſtice, at leaſt, in thoſe times of the Judges, when they were in ſubjection to thoſe neighbouring nations that tyranniſed over them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And there was a young man out of Bethlehem-Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Bethlehem in the tribe of Judah, (which was called Bethlehem Ephratah, Mich. 5.2.) to diſtinguiſh it from that Bethlehem which was in the tribe of Zebulun, Joſh. 19.15. But why is it ſaid in the next words that he was <hi>a Levite,</hi> and yet withall too <hi>of the familie of Judah?</hi> I anſwer, becauſe though he was a Levite, yet he was born and bred up amongſt them of the familie of Judah. It may be true which ſome conceive, that his father being a Levite, and ſojourning there, marryed a wife of the familie of Judah: but it is not uſuall in Scripture, to ſtyle men by the mothers familie, and therefore the meaning is, that there he had his birth and breeding: for which cauſe, he is alſo ſaid to have <hi>ſojourned there;</hi> becauſe he was not of that tribe, neither was Bethlehem one of the Levites cities, but there he lived as a ſtranger, as the Levites it ſeems did in many other places. Afterwards his name is expreſſed, and of what familie he was; to wit, that his name was <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and that he was <hi>the ſonne of Gerſhom, the ſonne of Manaſſeh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehem-Judah, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ where he could find a place,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſhews the corruptions of thoſe times; God had provided liberally for the tribe of Levi; but in theſe idolatrous times, the people had in a great meaſure forſaken the Tabernacle; and ſo their appointed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of tythes, it ſeems, was not yielded them; for then this Levite needed not have wandered up and down, to procure means of livelyhood. See the like, Neh. 13.10, 11. <hi>And I perceived that the portion of the Levites had not been given them; for the Levites, and the ſingers that did the work, were fled every one to his field. Then I contended with the rulers, and ſaid, Why is the houſe of God forſaken? and I gathered them together, and put them in their places.</hi>

But yet obſervable it is, that though he promiſed to reverence this Levite as a father (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his youth) if he would be his prieſt, <hi>be unto me</hi> ſaith he <hi>a father and a prieſt:</hi> yet it was but a poore ſalarie that he tendered him for his ſervice. <hi>I will give thee ten ſhekels of ſilver by the yeare, and a ſuit of apparell, and thy victuals:</hi> eleven hundred ſhekels of ſilver were ſet apart, to make their idols, and the appurtenances thereto belonging, and yet ten ſhekels of ſilver were thought enough for the prieſts wages. Indeed had not the time when this was done been extremely corrupt, a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite would never have proſtituted himſelf to ſuch a baſe ſervice, as to be a prieſt to their idol-dunghill-gods, and that too upon ſuch baſe terms; but hunger will ſnap at any thing, when there is no grace to reſtrain men; for ſo it follows in the next verſe, <hi>and the Levite was content to dwell with the man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>When they were by the houſe of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man, the Levite.]</hi> The Danites had part of their inheritance in that part of Canaan, which was at firſt aſſigned to the tribe of Judah, &amp; therefore it is not unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſome of theſe ſpies were formerly acquainted with this Levite, whilſt he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in Bethlehem-Judah, and ſo now knew his voice. However by the different dialect, or manner of ſpeech and pronunciation, which the men of Judah uſed, from that which was uſed by the inhabitants of mount Ephraim, they might know him to belong to Judah, though he now ſojourned in Ephraim; as we may ſee in that inſtance, chap. 12.6 where the men of Ephraim ſaid Sibboleth in ſtead of Shibboleth. And beſides, if they heard him ſpeak concerning the employments of his calling, by that they might know he was a Levite.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And they ſaid unto him, Ask counſel we pray thee of God,</hi> &amp;c.] Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Levite, that Micah had there a chappel of gods, and amongſt the reſt,

an Ephod and Teraphim, which were the Oracles, whereby in thoſe idolatrous times they were wont to enquire of God; and that he was hired to be Micahs prieſt, they deſired him that he would enquire of God, concerning the ſucceſſe of that great buſineſſe they were going about.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Go in peace; before the Lord is your way wherein ye go.]</hi> That is, the eye of the Lord it upon your way to remove all difficulties, and to make your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney proſperous; he will go out before you, and take care of your journey. Now this anſwer he might return of his own head, flatteringly, as falſe Prophets are wont to do. But yet God might permit Satan, by his Teraphim, or ſome ſuch Oracle, to foretell this concerning the ſucceſſe of their journey, Deut. 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>If there ariſe among you a prophet or a dreames of dreams, and giveth thee a ſigne, or a wonder, and the ſigne, or the wonder come to paſſe whereof he spake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go after other gods (which thou haſt not known) and let us ſerve them; thou ſhalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: For the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your ſoul.</hi> And this ſeems the more probable, becauſe his anſwer, as the devils Oracles had wont to be may be interpreted two ſeverall wayes; either that God ſaw what they were going about, or that God would proſper them in their journey. But the event anſwering that promiſe or prediction of ſucceſſe which he had given them, this made them highly eſteem both the prieſt and his idols.</p>

The ſecond is, that <hi>there was no magiſtrate in the land, that might put them to ſhame in any thing.</hi> For where there is no magiſtrates (who are called <hi>the ſhields of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 47.9.) either to reſtrain the people from that looſeneſſe, and manifold wickedneſſe they are ready to run into, or to provide for their defence, they muſt needs lie naked and open to all manner of miſchief; and the magiſtrates puniſhing

offenders, is here called a putting them to ſhame; becauſe the ſhame doth more curb men from evil, then the ſmart of puniſhments. The third is, that <hi>they were farre from the Sidonians,</hi> and therefore could not on a ſudden have any aid from them; and yet they were the onely people from whom they were like to have help, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted: And the fourth is, that there was neither league nor commerce between them and their neighbours; either of which might have wonne their neighbours to help them.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the five men that went to spy out the land, went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image,</hi> &amp;c.] Firſt, no doubt they brought out the prieſt to their brethren the Danites that ſtood at the gate, with whom whilſt the prieſt ſtaid, happely ſaluting ſome of the chief of them, wiſhing them good ſucceſſe in the enterpriſe they were going about, or otherwiſe ſhewing them ſuch courteſie, as to ſtrangers is wont to be afforded; in the interim the five men went back into his houſe, and fetched away the images, &amp;c. and therefore it is added in the following words, that the <hi>prieſt ſtood in the entering of the gate, with the ſix hundred men that were appointed with weapons of warre.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midſt of the people.]</hi> For all the reſpect that Micah had ſhown him, now he hoped to have a place of more advantage, away he goes: as for his going in the midſt with his idolatrous traſh, he did it either for the better defence both of them and his perſon, or in a kind of apiſh imitation of the arks being carried in the midſt of the tribes.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And he ſaid, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the prieſt, and ye are gone away: and what have I more?</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, that he eſteemed all that they had left him as nothing, now his gods were gone.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And they ſmote them with the edge of the ſword, and burnt the city with fire.]</hi> This is mentioned before, Joſh. 19.47. concerning which, ſee the note there. It may ſeem ſtrange why the Danites ſhould burn this city, ſeeing they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized it purpoſely that they might dwell in it, and it muſt needs be a great work, and of great charge to rebuild it again; but this we muſt conſider is uſuall when ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſtormed and taken, partly through the fury of the ſouldiers in the heat of the aſſault, and partly that they may the more eaſily deſtroy the inhabitants, whilſt they are forced to buſie themſelves in quenching the fire: cities are ſeldome taken by force, but that ſome part of them is burnt with fire.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And there was no deliverer, becauſe it was farre from Sydon,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note above, verſ. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it was in the valley that lyeth by Beth-Rehob,</hi> &amp;c.] Rehob was a city in the utmoſt north part of the land, near unto mount Libanus, and Hamath, Num. 13.21. <hi>So they went up and ſearched the land from the wilderneſſe of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath:</hi> it was within the portion aſſigned to Aſher. Joſh. 19 28. and appointed for the Levites in that tribe, Joſh. 21.31. but is reckoned amongſt thoſe cities, whoſe inhabitants the Aſherites did not drive out, Judg. 1.31. who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Syrians of Beth-Rehob,</hi> 2. Sam. 10.6. It is evident therefore that Laiſh, which was alſo now in the poſſeſſion of the Canaanites or Syrians, and was nigh Rehob, ſtood alſo in the utmoſt north parts of the land, near to the fountain of Dan, one of the heads of that river which was therefore called Jordan, whence was that prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall ſpeech, <hi>from Dan even to Beerſheba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe the Danites that ſeated themſelves here, ſo farre off from the reſt of their brethren, might fear leſt in future times their reference to their brethren ſhould be queſtioned, they named their city Dan, which was before called Laiſh, that it might be known to what tribe they belonged; yet withall it is probable they ſo named their city too in honour of their father the Patriarch, of whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended; but in the mean time they were idolaters and robbers, and this their father Dan did not do, as Chriſt ſpeaks in a like caſe, John 8.40. <hi>But now ye ſeek, to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And the children of Dan ſet up the graven image,</hi> &amp;c.] The good ſucceſſe which they had in their attempt upon Laiſh, according to the anſwer which they had received from this Oracle, made them highly eſteem both this prieſt and his images, and accordingly they eſtabliſhed this idolatrous worſhip of their falſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42229:99"/>
gods amongſt them; and ſo this Levite <hi>Jonathan the ſonne of Gerſhom,</hi> &amp;c. and his poſteritie, were prieſts unto theſe idolatrous Danites, <hi>untill the captivitie of the land.</hi> The moſt of Expoſitours underſtand this of that captivitie, when the ark was taken and carried away by the Philiſtines, 1. Sam. 4.10, 11. <hi>And the Philiſtines fought, and Iſrael was ſmitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great ſlaughter; for there fell of Iſrael thirty thouſand footmen. And the Ark of God was taken, and the two ſonnes of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas were ſlain;</hi> for then we ſee there was a great ſlaughter amongſt the Iſraelites, and no doubt, many of them were carried away captive, together with the ark; and all this befell them, becauſe of the idolatrie that was then in the land, Pſal. 78.58, 59. <hi>They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealouſie with their graven images. When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Iſrael. So that he forſook the Tabernacle of Shiloh; the tent which he placed among men,</hi> &amp;c. Beſides, Micahs graven image, upon which depended the ſervice of this idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous prieſt, and his ſucceſſours, ſtood up onely till the remove of the Tabernacle from Shiloh, verſ. 31. <hi>And they ſet them up Micahs graven image which he made, all the time that the houſe of God was in Shiloh;</hi> which was doubtleſſe about that time, when the Ark was taken by the Philiſtines; ſo that hence it may ſeem very probable, that the prieſthood of theſe men continued no longer; and that this is the captivitie here ſpoken of. Beſides, if it be underſtood of that captivitie, when the ten tribes were carried away captives into Aſſyria, by Shalmaneſer, 2. Kings 17. it may be judged very unlikely, that theſe idolatrous prieſts ſhould in Samuels time be ſuffered, eſpecially in Davids, who was ſo holy, and potent a King. But yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the captivieie of the land,</hi> cannot well be underſtood, otherwiſe then of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall captivitie, I ſee not why it ſhould not be underſtood of that captivitie when the people were carried away into Aſſyria by Shalmaneſer. It is indeed manifeſt by the following verſe, that Micahs image was pulled down, not long after the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was removed from Shiloh; and in Sauls time, it is manifeſt, that the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was in Nob, 1. Sam. 21. But yet, though the idol was ſuppreſt, theſe idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous prieſts might (in ſecret eſpecially, though not openly) continue to do this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious ſervice for the Danites, unto the time of Jeroboam; and then might be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as prieſts for his golden calf, which was erected in this citie Dan, 1. Kings, 12.29. <hi>He ſet the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan:</hi> for though <hi>he made prieſts of the loweſt of the people that were not Levites,</hi> verſ. 31. yet that doth not hinder but that theſe idolaters, though Levites, might be of the number of his prieſts too: and ſo they might continue till that generall captivitie of the ten tribes.</p>

                     <hi>There was a certain Levite ſojourning on the ſide of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem-Judah.]</hi> Some concubines there were amongſt the Hebrews, that were eſteemed lawfull wives; as concerning the right of the bed, who yet were not eſteemed in the rank with other wives, principally and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called; for they had not the honour of being accounted the mother of the

familie, their children did not inherit with the reſt, &amp;c. and that either becauſe they were before ſuch as lived in a ſervile condition, as Hagar; or becauſe they were taken in a ſecond place, and were not with the ſame rites and ſolemnities married to them, as the others were; concerning which ſee the note, Gen. 22.24. and 25.6. and ſuch a concubine it ſeems this was; and therefore is the Levite called her husband, both here verſ. 3. <hi>And her husband aroſe, and went after her to ſpeak friendly unto her,</hi> and again, chap. 20.4. <hi>And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was ſlain, anſwered,</hi> &amp;c. and her father, his father in law, in ſeverall places. Why Bethlehem from whence this Levite had his concubine, is called Bethlehem-Judah. See in the note, chap. 17.7.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And his concubine plaid the whore againſt him, &amp; went away from him unto her fathers houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems, upon ſome diſcoverie of her whoredome, or at leaſt ſome ſuſpition the Levite had of it, there aroſe ſome quarrell betwixt him and his concubine; and thereupon ſhe left him, and went home again to her fathers houſe, who was too ready to entertain her. The ſad effects that followed upon this Levites taking a concubine, makes it manifeſt, that even in thoſe times, though it were an ordinary thing amongſt all ſorts of men, even amongſt the Levites, to have concubines, yet God was not pleaſed with it: <hi>from the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Matth. 19.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And her husband aroſe, and went after her to ſpeak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his ſervant with him, and a couple of aſſes.)</hi> To wit, to carrie their proviſion, and happely, that both himſelf, and his concubine, if ſhe would return with him, might ſometimes eaſe themſelves by riding as occaſion ſerved.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in unto this citie of the Jebuſites, and lodge in it.]</hi> For though the children of Judah had taken from the Jebuſites that part of Jebus that is, Jeruſalem, which was in their tribe, chap. 1.8. <hi>The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Judah had fought against Jeruſalem, and had taken it, and had ſmitten it with the edge of the ſword:</hi> yet out of that part which belonged to Benjamin (on which ſide the Levite was now travelling) the Jebuſites were not wholly expelled, chap. 1.21. <hi>The children of Benjamin did not drive out the inhabitants of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; but the Jebuſites dwell in Jeruſalem with the children of Benjamin unto this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the ſunne went down upon them, when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.]</hi> There was a Gibeah in the tribe of Judah, Joſh. 15.57. to diſtinguiſh this from that, it is here called <hi>Gibeah, which belongeth to Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> and elſe where <hi>Gibeah of Saul,</hi> 1. Sam. 11.4. it is thought to be the ſame, which Joſh. 21.17. is called <hi>Gebah,</hi> which was a citie given to tho Prieſts, the ſonnes of Aaron. Againſt which it makes nothing, that here it is ſaid, verſ. 16. <hi>the men of the place were Benjamites:</hi> for the prieſts did not dwell alone in ſuch cities, though they were the lords and owners of them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And they turned aſide thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah.]</hi> Though it were a pious reſolution in the Levite, rather to choſe to lodge in Gibeah then in Jebus, and that becauſe Jebus was a citie wherein the idolatrous and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Jebuſites dwelt; yet this proved fatall both to him and his, as the beſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42229:100"/>
counſell may have the worſt ſucceſſe, and that becauſe there is a ſecret over-ruling hand of God, that may by this means bring about what he hath determined for the puniſhment of ſome other ſinnes which we mind not.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And behold, there came an old man from his work, out of the field at even, which was alſo of mount Ephraim.]</hi> Though he were an old man, yet he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his work in the field, and that untill the even, which is doubtleſſe noted to his praiſe. As for that laſt clauſe, that he was alſo of mount Ephraim, that no doubt is expreſſed to intimate, that this amongſt other things made the old man the readier to entertain the Levite, when he heard him ſay verſ. 18. that he was of mount E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim too.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>But I am now going to the houſe of the Lord.]</hi> The Tabernacle at this time was in Shiloh, Joſh. 18.1. and Shiloh was in the tribe of Ephraim: either therefore there the Levites dwelling was; or elſe, he meant firſt to go to the houſe of the Lord, to do his ſervice there; and then afterwards to paſſe forward on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney homeward. However, it is probable, that he mentions his going to the houſe of the Lord, that he might know him to be a Levite.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Behold, the men of the city, certain ſonnes of Belial, beſet the houſe round about,</hi> &amp;c.] A like fact to this we have formerly related, concerning the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites; of which ſee the note, Gen. 19.4. as for this term <hi>Sonnes of Belial,</hi> ſee Deut. 13.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Behold, here is my daughter a mayden, and his concubine, them I will bring out now,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, Gen. 19.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>So the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her,</hi> &amp;c.] In the foregoing words it is ſaid, that when the old man, the Levites hoſt, proffered theſe varlets his daughter, a virgin, and the Levites concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, thereby to take them off from that unnaturall uncleanneſſe, wherewith they meant to ſatisfie their luſt upon the Levite himſelf, <hi>the men would not hearken to him;</hi> yet when immediately by the Levites means, his concubine was indeed brought out unto them, and left amongſt them, they fell upon her and defiled her, and that in ſuch an outrageous barbarous manner, that ſhe died of it; which was doubtleſſe, becauſe having once an object for their luſt in their power, they could not forbear; and ſo forgetting their former reſolutions, they laid hold on her, and abuſed her in a moſt inhumane and execrable manner.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the doore of the mans houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſhe fell down dead at the doore of the mans houſe, and there lay till break of day, when her husband going forth to ſee what was become of her, found her dead; and thus though her husband had pardoned her whoredome, yet God puniſhed it, and that too with her own ſinne; adulterie was her ſinne, and adulterie was her death; ſhe had dealt treacherouſly againſt her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; one would not ſatisfie her, but ſhe expoſed her ſelf to the luſt of a ſtranger; and now ſhe was abuſed to death, by the luſts of ſo many barbarous wretches, whom ſhe knew not, that by ſo abuſing her they murdered her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And her hands were upon the threſhold.]</hi> This is added, to implie the reaſon of that which follows, why the Levite ſpake to her to riſe, verſ. 28. <hi>And he ſaid unto her, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, let us be going;</hi> to wit, becauſe ſhe lay in ſuch a manner, her
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42229:101"/>
hands laid upon the threſhold under her head, as if ſhe had been aſleep.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>He took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her bones into twelve pieces, and ſent her into all the coaſts of Iſrael.]</hi> That is, to each of the twelve tribes a piece (for to the tribe of Levi that was diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through all the land, there was none ſent) and this was done, that the fight of her dead limbs might affect them the more, and ſtirre them up to be the more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the puniſhment of this horrible villanie, that had been committed upon his concubine, Some conceive, that there was none ſent to the tribe of Benjamin, but that there was two pieces ſent to the tribe of Manaſſeh, becauſe that tribe dwelt half within Jordan, and half without. But this is altogether a groundleſſe conceit; for there was moſt reaſon for ſending a piece to Benjamin, in regard the fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a citie of their tribe; and there was as much reaſon why they ſhould have ſent two pieces to the tribe of Dan, as to the tribe of Manaſſeh; ſince the tribe of Dan was alſo ſeated in two ſeverall parts of the land; ſome in the portion of Judah, and ſome northward at Laiſh, as in the former chapter was related.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And it was ſo, that all that ſaw it, ſaid, There was no ſuch deed done nor ſeen,</hi> &amp;c.] The meſſengers relating the cauſe why the Levite had done this, not onely the elders of each tribe, (to whom theſe parcels of her body were ſent, becauſe there was no magiſtrate armed with regall power to puniſh this fact) but even all that came to the hearing of it, cried out againſt it as a matchleſſe vill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>We will go up by lot againſt it.]</hi> That is, we will by lot determine it, who ſhall go up to fight againſt Gibeah, and who ſhall go forth to fetch in victuals, and other proviſions for the people: one in ten had need to be ſet apart for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and who they ſhall be, the lot ſhall decide.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the tribes of Iſrael ſent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the Benjamites abſenting themſelves from the aſſembly of all Iſrael at Mizpeh, was a juſt ground of ſuſpition, that they meant not to yield up the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours to be puniſhed; yet would not the Iſraelites thereupon make warre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently againſt them, but firſt they ſent meſſengers to all the families of the tribe of Benjamin, to deſire the deliverie of thoſe ſonnes of Belial to deſerved
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42229:102"/>
puniſhment, that ſo if it were poſſible, bloud-ſhed and civill war might be prevented.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Iſrael.]</hi> That is, make others affraid to commit ſuch horrible ſinnes, and do what we can to divert the evil of puniſhment, which God may elſe juſtly lay upon us, even by cutting them off which have committed this crying villany.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though the Iſraelites were their brethren, whoſe advice therefore they might well think, tended equally to the good of them all, and againſt whom to fight in the defence of ſuch wretches, muſt needs be counted a moſt unnaturall and ungodly courſe; yet becauſe they thought it a diſhonour to them, that the other tribes ſhould intermeddle with puniſhing any within their territories, and were ſo proud of their ſtrength, and highly conceited of their abilities for martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that they thought themſelves able enough to make good their part againſt all the tribes of Iſrael beſide, they would not hearken to their brethren but prepared to fight it out.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the children of Benjamin were numbred at that time out of the cities, twenty and ſix thouſand,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added, to imply what it was that made them deſpiſe the counſell of their brethren, to wit, their confidence in their own ſtrength; of this ſix and twenty thouſand and ſeven hundred, there were ſlain by the Iſraelites <hi>twenty five thouſand and an hundred,</hi> verſ. 35. and there were onely ſix hundred of them that ſaved themſelves in the rock Rimmon, verſ. 47. It ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the other thouſand were ſlain in the two firſt battels wherein the Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites overcame the Iſraelites; for it is not likely they ſhould vanquiſh the Iſraelites in two ſet battells, and kill ſo many thouſand of them without any loſſe in their own army.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And the children of Iſrael aroſe, and went up to the houſe of God.</hi> &amp;c.] The houſe of God was at this time in Shiloh, ſee verſ. 27. &amp; thither therefore they went to ask counſell of God, ſaying <hi>Which of us ſhall go up first to the battell,</hi> &amp;c. It may ſeem ſtrange that the people of God, undertaking ſo juſt a warre as this was againſt the Benjamites, out of a zeal to puniſh thoſe that had committed ſo foul a ſinne &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Benjamites did undertake the defence of them that they might not be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſhould notwithſtanding be twice beaten and vanquiſhed by thoſe Benjamites, as we ſee afterwards they were, not without the loſſe of fourty thouſand of their men, eſpecially if we conſider this which is here ſaid, that before they went to fight with them, they were ſo carefull to go to the houſe of the Lord, that there they might ask counſell of God; but to remove this ſcruple, we muſt know that God is wont in great wiſdome, and without any ſtain either to his juſtice or mercy towards his people, to ſuffer a while, thoſe that have a juſt cauſe to go by the worſt: as firſt, to prevent the aſcribing of their victory to their own proweſſe or ſtrength, by letting them ſee how little good their great armies could do, if the Lord ſhould withhold his help from them: ſecondly, to beat them off from that confidence in their great ſtrength and in the juſtneſſe of their cauſe, which beforehand he perceives in them: till men have learnt to go out of themſelves, and to rely onely upon God, they are not fit for his aid: thirdly, to puniſh them for ſome ſinnes, wherein he perceives them to runne
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42229:102"/>
on without fear; that ſo by their loſſe, they may be brought to ſee, bewail, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe ſinnes. And for theſe reaſons doubtleſſe God did ſuffer theſe Iſraelites to be ſo ſhamefully beaten by the Benjamites; for both idolatry and many other ſinnes were rife amongſt them, as we ſee, chap. 17.6. and particularly in the idolatry of Micah and the Danites: 2. truſting in the juſtneſſe of their cauſe, and the multitude of their men, in regard of whom the Benjamites were but a handfull: their ſpirits were too much puffed up with aſſurance of victory, and hence it was that they never asked God whether they ſhould go againſt the Benjamites, or whether they ſhould prevail; they never prayed to God for his help, they never ſought by faſting &amp; humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, by repenting of their own ſinnes, and by offering up ſacrifices of atonement, to make their peace with God; but onely as men aſſured of victory, to prevent vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance amongſt themſelves, they deſired to know which of the tribes ſhould go up firſt againſt Benjamin; they concluded, that having eleven tribes againſt one, four hundred thouſand againſt ſix and twenty thouſand, they muſt needs prevail.</p>

It ſeems their weeping now was more for their loſſe in the former battell, then for their ſinnes, or at leaſt that they were not ſo throughly humbled, and ſo truly penitent as was fitting; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore again after this their enemies prevailed. Indeed now they began to ſee that their multitude and ſtrength was vain without Gods help, and therefore enquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould go forth to battell againſt the Benjamites or no; but withall they pitched upon a wrong cauſe of their ill ſucceſſe, ſuppoſing it was onely becauſe God was not pleaſed with their making warre againſt their brethren, never thinking of their ſinnes; and therefore God anſwers them accordingly, <hi>Go up againſt him:</hi> which was no more in effect then this, though he be your brother you may fight againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>All the people came up, and came unto the houſe of God and wept, and ſat there before the Lord and faſted,</hi> &amp;c.] Now they not onely wept as they did before, verſ. 23. (which might onely be for the loſſe they ſuſtained) but alſo <hi>faſted and offered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings before the Lord:</hi> which ſhews that now they perceived that though God liked the cauſe they had undertaken, yet he was diſpleaſed with their perſons, and that therefore they faſted and affliſted their ſouls in a moſt ſolemne manner, repenting them of their ſinnes, and turning to the Lord, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, to make an atonement for their ſinnes, and to obtain Gods favour, that he would now proſper them in this their warre againſt Benjamin.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42229:104"/>
The moſt of Expoſitours hold, that the drift of this oath was the utter extirpation of the tribe of Benjamin; as indeed all the women of their own tribe being ſlain, this withholding from them the daughters of Iſrael, muſt needs extinguiſh the tribe, unleſſe they would marrie the daughters of the heathen about them, which was not lawfull; but yet the opinion of Expoſitours differeth about this oath. For ſome hold, that it was an unlawfull, unadviſed, raſh oath, thus to bind themſelves to cut off a tribe from Iſrael; and that now they began to ſee their folly, and repent themſelves of it: but then others think that it was lawfull and warrantable; (yea ſome, that it was not without Gods appointment) becauſe it is not likely, that Phinehas, and others ſuch as he, would elſe have ſuffered them publickly to bind themſelves with ſuch an oath. Now herein I conceive, that they are on both ſides miſtaken, in that they think this oath aimed at the extinguiſhing of the tribe, whereas it appears not that they ever meant wholly to root out all, men, women and children, in the tribe; but onely, that having deſtroyed utterly all the inhabitants of Gibeah, they would alſo then ſend ſeverall companies of their army, to the ſeverall cities of Benjamin, and deſtroy them alſo with a great deſtruction; unto which they then added this oath, in a further manifeſtation of their deteſting this fact of the Benjamites, in maintaining the men of Gibeah, who were guiltie of ſuch a horrible villanie, to wit, that they would not make any marriages with thoſe that ſhould remain of the tribe, to ſhew that they eſteemed no otherwiſe of them, then of heathens, and ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not the name of Iſraelites: which will appear the more probable, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, firſt, that it is no where expreſſed, that they vowed to deſtroy all the men and women in this tribe: ſecondly, that if they had ſo vowed, there would have been no place for this vow, of not giving their daughters in marriage to them: thirdly, that the vow being made before the battel, they might have ſuppoſed that ſome of the women might eſcape, as well as ſome of the men: and fourthly, that verſ. 3. they ſeem to ſay, that this danger of loſing a tribe, was happened unto them beſides their expectation: <hi>Why is this come to paſſe,</hi> ſay they, &amp;c? This ſeems to be that which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them. All the men, women, and children, being in the heat of battel, beſides their expectation, every where ſlain (the Iſraelites every where falling upon them with extreme furie) thoſe ſix hundred men onely excepted, that were fled to the rock Rimmon, they now ſaw that the keeping their oath of not making marriages with them, would tend to the utter extirpation of the tribe; and this did now at laſt exceedingly perplex them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the people came up to the houſe of God,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, when they perceived that all the women of Benjamin were deſtroyed, and none left of that tribe, but onely thoſe ſix hundred men that were fled to the rock Rimmon, chap. 20.47. for now at length they began to conſider into what a ſtrait they were fallen; namely, that having ſlain all the women of Benjamin, and having withall made a vow, that none of them would give their daughters in marriage to the men of that tribe, either thoſe ſix hundred men muſt take them wives from the heathens, and ſo the holy ſeed muſt be polluted; or elſe a tribe muſt periſh from Iſrael, (and ſo their body politick which God had formed, muſt be diſmembred) or themſelves muſt break an oath which they had ſolemnly taken, as in Gods preſence; and ſo thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they went with their whole army to the houſe of God in Shiloh, (and therefore
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42229:104"/>
it is ſaid in the twelfth verſe of this chapter, that the camp was in Shiloh) there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail theſe difficulties they were fallen into; and to conſult together; yea, happely alſo to enquire of God what they ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>O Lord God of Iſrael, why is this come to paſſe in Iſrael, that there ſhould be to day one tribe lacking in Iſrael?]</hi> As if they had ſaid, Alas Lord, that it ſhould ſo be, that one tribe ſhould be wholly cut off from thy people: for I conceive the words are onely ſpoken to bewail the loſſe of a tribe; but yet more may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, for if they deſtroyed all the women, not by warrant of any command from God, which ſome think they did, but onely through their own immoderate rage and fury againſt them; it may well be, that theſe words were ſpoken to intimate, by way of excuſing themſelves, that they did not intend to have deſtroyed them all; and that this was happened to them beſides their expectation, through the ſecret all-ruling providence of God; and that therefore they would deſire the Lord that ſome thing might be done to prevent this great evil.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the people roſe early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings, and peace offerings.]</hi> Being at the houſe of God in Shiloh, what needed they any other altar then that in the Tabernacle? I anſwer, that either this altar was built as a memoriall of Gods proſpering them againſt the Benjamites, and that their ſacrifices were notwithſtanding offered on the altar in the Tabernacle; or elſe that they reared this altar for this preſent occaſion, becauſe the ordinary altar was not ſufficient for the offering up of ſuch a multitude of ſacrifices, as were now brought in by the people, after they had prevailed againſt the Benjamites; for the like we ſee was done, 1. Kings 8.64. <hi>The ſame day did the King hallow the middle of the court that was before the houſe of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: becauſe the brazen altar that was before the Lord, was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings:</hi> and that the rearing of altars, upon ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſions was not unlawfull, we may probably gather from Exod. 20.24. <hi>An altar of earth thou ſhalt make unto me, and ſhalt ſacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy ſheep and thy oxen: In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will bleſſe thee.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord to Mizpeh, ſaying, He ſhall ſurely be put to death.]</hi> This cannot be meant of every particular man, but it muſt be meant of every citie, or town, that ſent none to help them againſt the Benjamites; and the oath they had taken concerning theſe, is called <hi>a great oath,</hi> partly, becauſe it was generally taken by all the people in a ſolemn manner; and partly, becauſe it was taken with ſome ſevere execration againſt any, that ſhould dare to break it, as is expreſſed concerning the other oath, verſ. 18. <hi>Howbeit, we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Iſrael have ſworn, ſaying, Curſed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</hi>

Behold, there is a feaſt of the Lord in Shiloh yearly,</hi> &amp;c.] Having hitherto onely provided four hundred wives for four hundred of the Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites that were fled to the rock Rimmon; now they pitch upon another way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the other two hundred ſhould be ſupplyed with wives, that ſo that tribe that was almoſt wholly deſtroyed, might the ſooner grow up again: namely, that at the time when there was a feaſt of the Lord kept yearly in Shiloh, theſe two hundred Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites ſhould hide themſelves in the vineyards there abouts, and ſo when the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Shiloh came forth to dance, they ſhould then catch every man his wife, and ſo carry them away. A great queſtion it is, what feaſt it was in Shiloh when this was to be done; ſome conceive it was ſome civill feſtivity, and time of rejoycing which they kept in that town, either becauſe of ſome fair or time of extraordinary concourſe for traffique or ſome ſuch like occaſion; but others again think that it was one of thoſe three ſolemne feaſts, when all the males of Iſrael were to come up to the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Lord, Deut. 16.16. and indeed becauſe the Tabernacle was now in Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh, and becauſe it is called <hi>a feaſt of the Lord;</hi> this ſeems the more probable: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard the women uſed to come up voluntarily from all parts of the land at theſe feaſts to the Tabernacle, (though onely the males were bound to come up by the Law) it may be thought that they ſhould alſo joyn in theſe dances, and then it may be queſtioned how they ſhould propound to the Benjamites the taking away the daughters of Shiloh onely; but for this we muſt conſider, that it ſeems it was a known cuſtome, that onely the inhabitants the daughters of Shiloh uſed to go forth in dances; at leaſt in that place where the Benjamites were appointed to lie in wait for them, and hence was this plot laid for the taking of the daughters of Shiloh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As for this courſe which the Iſraelites took to provide wives for the Benjamites, without breaking the oath the oath they had taken, it may juſtly ſeem ſtrange that they ſhould ſatisfie their conſciences therewith: for what difference was there between giving the Benjamites wives of any of the daughters of their tribes; and appointing them with their conſent to go and take them by force? doubtleſſe this was but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to delude conſcience, when they found their oath could not be kept without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a tribe to periſh; how much better had it been to condemne the raſhneſſe of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42229:105"/>
their oath, and ſo to take the liberty which was given them of God? But when men have a deſire to do what is cauſeleſſely ſcrupled, they are naturally more inclinable to ſtop the mouth of conſcience with ſome groundleſſe device or excuſe, then to ſee their own folly, and to judge themſelves for their former errour.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards,</hi> &amp;c] Hereby it appears, that in thoſe dayes dancing was one of the wayes whereby they expreſſed their joy, even when it was holy and ſpirituall, as we ſee likewiſe, Exod. 15.20. <hi>And Miriam the propheteſſe the ſiſter of Aaron took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances;</hi> but then withall we muſt note, that the virgins danced apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for had their been men with them, the Benjamites could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o eaſily have ſnatched them away: mixed dancing is very dangerous, and was not it ſeems uſed in thoſe times by the people of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Be favourable unto them for our ſakes, becauſe we reſerved not to each man his wife in the warre,</hi> &amp;c.] By two arguments, the Elders of Iſrael do here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to perſwade the men of Shiloh not to be offended with the Benjamites for taking away their daughters; to wit, firſt, becauſe their was an errour committed by the Iſraelites, in that <hi>they reſerved not to each man his wife in the warre,</hi> that is, in the warre againſt Jabeſh-Gilead: and ſecondly, becauſe it was no breach of their oath, that the Benjamites had taken them wives of their daughters, <hi>ye did not</hi> (ſay they) <hi>give unto them at this time, that you ſhould be guilty,</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, ye have not broken the oath ye took, becauſe ye gave them not your daughters, but they took them by force.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>In thoſe dayes there was no king in Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, chap. 17.6.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow it came to paſſe in the dayes when the Judges ruled,</hi> &amp;c.] This Hiſtorie of Ruth is an Appendix to that of Judges, in whoſe time it happened; yet it is put in a book apart by it ſelf, becauſe the ſtorie was of ſuch ſpeciall concernment, in that it relates ſome remarkable paſſages concerning the genealogie of David, of whom Chriſt the promiſed Meſſiah deſcended. By whom, and when this book was written, is no where expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, onely by the Genealogie of David ſet down in the end of this book; it is manifeſt that it was written after Davids time, unleſſe that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the book in ſucceeding times: Under which of the Judges this ſtorie happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we cannot ſay, neither; but yet they that referre it to the dayes of Deborah and Barak; or at the utmoſt, to the dayes of Gideon, have the faireſt probabilities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ground their conjectures. For Boaz, who married Ruth, was the ſonne of Salmon by Rahab, Matth. 1.5. who was a woman grown, when the Iſraelites firſt entred Canaan; and Obed the ſonne of this Boaz, was the grandfather of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and therefore the marriage of Boaz with Ruth, could not be long either before or after thoſe dayes of Deborah and Barak. That it was in the dayes of the Judges, is noted, that we might take notice, how by this famine God puniſhed the ſinnes of thoſe times, as he had threatned, Deut. 28.23, 24. <hi>And the heaven that is over thy head ſhall be braſſe, and the earth that is under thee ſhall be iron. The Lord ſhall make the rain of thy land powder and dust,</hi> &amp;c. they were now fallen to idolatrie, and many other grievous ſinnes; and now this land which flowed with milk and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, became barren; yea <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that is, <hi>the houſe of bread,</hi> ſo called it ſeems, from the extraordinary fruitfulneſſe of the countrey where it ſtood, felt this ſcourge of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the name of his two ſonnes, Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-Judah.]</hi> So called, becauſe this Bethlehem was formerly called Ephrath, Gen. 35.19. Bethlehem-Judah, to diſtinguiſh it from another Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebulun, Joſh. 19.15. and Bethlehem-Ephratha, becauſe the countrey where it ſtood was called Ephrata, Micah 5.2. <hi>Thou Bethleem-Ephrathah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Iſrael:</hi> And thus alſo there is a difference made betwixt them, and thoſe in the tribe of Ephraim who were alſo ſo called; for <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is called <hi>an Ephrathite,</hi> 1. Kings 11.26.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Elimelech Naomies husband dyed, &amp;c.]</hi> This is mentioned, as one of the great afflictions that befell Naomi, who is propounded as a pattern of patience to all ſucceeding times; and perhaps too (for ſo ſome Expoſitours conceive) as an occaſion of that which is next related, to wit, his ſonnes marrying with the daughters of Moab, which it may well be they would not have done, if their father had lived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:42229:106"/>Verſ. 4. <hi>And they took them wives of the women of Moab, the name of one was Orpah,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Mahlon took Ruth to wife, and Chilion Orpah: for chap. 4.10. ſhe is called <hi>Ruth the Moabiteſſe, the wife of Mahlon.</hi> If they had not imbraced the true religion before they marryed them, doubtleſſe they ſinned in taking theſe wives: Deut. 7.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt make no covenant with them, nor ſhew mercy unto them. Neither ſhalt thou make marriages with them,</hi> &amp;c. Neh. 13.23. <hi>In thoſe dayes alſo ſaw I Jews that had married wives of Aſhdod, of Ammon, and of Moab,</hi> &amp;c. and indeed by that ſpeech of Naomi, verſ. 15. <hi>Behold, thy ſiſter in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods:</hi> it ſeems that Orpah had not as yet imbraced the true Religion; and hence it may ſeem to have been, that they died within a while after, and that without children. For when Gods people walk out of Gods wayes, they uſually meet with ſore croſſes and troubles.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.]</hi> Hereby it appears that both Orpah and Ruth did at firſt intend to have gone with Naomi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of Judah, though afterwards Orpah went back to her own friends, and onely Ruth went along with Naomi.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And Naomi ſaid unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mothers houſe.]</hi> The mothers houſe is mentioned, firſt, becauſe daughters, when they are in their fathers houſe, are wont to be moſt with their mothers: ſecondly, becauſe in thoſe times, the women of each familie did uſually live apart in a ſeverall dwelling by themſelves: and thirdly, becauſe herein is implied a reaſon to induce them to return to wit, that it was pitie they ſhould leave their own mothers, to go into a ſtrange countrey with a mother in law: and indeed though Naomi could not but deſire much to enjoy ſtill the ſocietie of her daughters, whom ſhe loved ſo dearly, yet becauſe they were like to endure much hardneſſe, if they went with her, who was poore, and left to the wide world; and this ſhe could not think on without grief: it is likely enough, that ſhe might ſeriouſly perſwade them to return; (for Ruth might have continued in the true Religion, though ſhe had remained ſtill in her own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) but yet withall ſhe might be moved thus to ſpeak to them, becauſe however ſhe ſhould by this means trie their affections, whether they would be content, knowing all that might be alleadged againſt it, to go along with her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>The Lord grant you, that you may find rest each of you in the houſe of her husband.]</hi> That is, the Lord provide you good husbands, and ſuch with whom you may live comfortably, and not meet with ſuch troubles as you have with my ſonnes undergone. Again ſingle women are uſually ſubject to many cares, troubles and wrongs, and when they meet with husbands that are lovingly tender over them, and carefull to defend them from injuries, and to provide things neceſſary for them, then are their husbands houſes reſting places; and hence Naomi might uſe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to her daughters in laws.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Are there yet any more ſonnes in my womb, that they may be your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.]</hi> This ſhe ſpeaks with reſpect to that law whereby the widow was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to marry the brother of her deceaſed husband, Deut. 25.2. Either therefore theſe daughters of Moab had been made acquainted herewith by Naomi, or their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; or perhaps it was a cuſtome too in thoſe times amongſt other nations.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Nay, my daughters: for it grieveth me much for your ſakes,</hi> &amp;c.] As
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42229:107"/>
if ſhe ſhould ſay, There is no hope of comfort this way from me, and therefore return home to your own land and friends, that there you may meet with husbands with whom you may live comfortably: for indeed, though the hand of the Lord be heavy upon me, it grieveth me not ſo much for my ſelf, as for you, that I am able to yield you no comfort at all.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Behold, thy ſiſter in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy ſiſter in law.)</hi> Naomi was doubtleſſe ſeriouſly troubled that her daughters ſhould for her ſake leave their countrey and friends, to go along with her a poore deſolate widow, to ſhare in her miſerie; and therefore overſwayed with this her grief, might in the bitterneſſe of her ſoul propound to Ruth the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Orpah her ſiſter (for they had married two brethren) thereby ſeriouſly to move her to return alſo, that ſhe might not be expoſed to that miſerie, which with her ſhe was like to undergo: (and the rather becauſe ſhe might hope that Ruth would be conſtant in the true Religion) but yet becauſe ſhe ſaw that Ruth was more bent to ſtay with her, then her ſiſter Orpah was, it it moſt probable, that this ſhe now ſaid to her, was chiefly intended to trie her; and therefore ſhe mentions Orpah her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to her gods, thereby as it were to put her in mind, that ſhe muſt be content to leave both her people and gods too, that ſhe had formerly ſerved, if ſhe would go along with her; and therefore ought ſeriouſly to conſider of it what ſhe would do.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>The Lord do ſo to me and more alſo, if ought but death part thee and me.]</hi> This form of ſwearing or imprecation, which Ruth here uſeth, <hi>The Lord do ſo to me and more alſo,</hi> was it ſeems familiar, not amongſt the Jews onely, as we may ſee in many ſeverall places of the books of Samuel and the Kings, as 1. Sam. 3.17, &amp;c. but alſo amongſt other nations, when they ſwore by their falſe gods, as it is evident, 1. Kin. 19.2. &amp; 20.10. The drift of this imprecation was, doubtleſſe to expreſſe that they deſired ſome notable miſchief might befal them, if they did not do what they ſaid they would do, or what they deſired ſhould be done by others. But why did they not expreſſe the evil they deſired ſhould fall upon them? I anſwer, that it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that at firſt the cuſtome of ſwearing thus, without naming the miſchief they wiſhed, was taken up, either becauſe they were naturally afraid to mention the evil they wiſhed to themſelves or others; not daring to uſe ſuch deſperate expreſſions as bold wretches nowadayes uſe without fear, as <hi>God confound me,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe, becauſe by this ſuppreſſing the evil they deſired might light upon themſelves, or others, they did purpoſely intimate how grievous the miſchiefs were they wiſhed to themſelves or others in caſe they did not what they vowed to do, or that others did not what they deſired of them; namely, that they were ſuch that they were afraid to name them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>All the citie was moved about them, and they ſaid, Is this Naomi?]</hi> That is, all the inhabitants of the citie were moved with much compaſſion and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at the ſad condition wherein ſhe was come back from the land of Moab. It ſeems ſhe was a woman of good rank and note, above others in Bethlehem when ſhe went thence; and therefore the report of her being returned home in ſuch a poore plight, being ſoon ſpread about the city, every bodie wondred at it; and gazing at her as they had any occaſion to ſee her, they cried out <hi>Is this Naomi?</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, What an alteration is here? who would have ever looked to ſee Naomi in ſuch a condition? It ſeems, that not onely her povertie, but even the wonderfull
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42229:107"/>
change of her countenance, by reaſon of exceeding much ſorrow, made all that ſaw her and had known her formerly, wonder at her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitterly with me.]</hi> Though the complaints of the beſt in the houre of affliction are many times too full of paſſion, yet the ſingular pietie of Naomi makes it moſt probable, that ſhe ſpake not this by way of murmuring, or with charging God for dealing too ſeverely with her; but onely to expreſſe, that the Lord had brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bitter afflictions and ſorrows upon her; in regard whereof <hi>Mara,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>bitter,</hi> was a fitter name for her then <hi>Naomi,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>pleaſant,</hi> or <hi>merry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>The Lord hath testified againſt me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?]</hi> Becauſe afflictions are ordinarily the manifeſtations of the Lords anger and diſpleaſure againſt his people for their ſinnes; whence is that of Job, chap. 10.17. <hi>Thou renewest thy witneſſes against me, and increaſest thine indignation upon me:</hi> and again, chap. 16.8. <hi>Thou hast filled me with wrinckles, which is a witneſſe against me;</hi> therefore it is, that Naomi ſpeaketh thus of her afflictions, <hi>The Lord hath teſtified againſt me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Naomi had a kinſman of her husbands,</hi> &amp;c.] To intimate why Boaz at the firſt knowledge of Ruth, ſhewed her ſuch favour as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the following part of the chapter, this is here prefixed that he was a near kinſman of Elimelechs, Naomies husband.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him, in whoſe ſight I ſhall find grace.]</hi> Theſe laſt words, <hi>in whoſe ſight I ſhall find grace,</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to imply, that ſhe would be carefull no way to be offenſive to any, and that ſhe would not glean without leave; for which her modeſty, ſhe is expreſſely commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Boaz his bayliffe, verſ. 7. <hi>She ſaid, I pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers amongst the ſheaves:</hi> whereby we may ſee, that though the gleanings of their corn, were by the Law of God appointed for the poore, Levit. 19.9. <hi>Thou ſhalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither ſhalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harveſt;</hi> yet the poore were to take them as a matter of favour from the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if not to crave leave too when they went to gather them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Then ſaid Boaz unto his ſervant that was ſet over the reapers, Whoſe damſel is this?]</hi> This he might ask, either becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he perceived ſhe was a ſtranger; or becauſe he found her ſitting in the houſe: ſee the following note.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>So ſhe came, and hath continued even from the morning, untill now that ſhe tarried a little in the houſe.]</hi> It may ſeem that Ruth in the heat of the day, did with-draw her ſelf to the houſe, or hovel, which was there in the field, wherein hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely the harveſt men did eat their meat, that there ſhe might a while eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh her ſelf, and then return to her work again, (which might alſo be the chief oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that induced Boaz, ſeeing her ſit there, to enquire verſ. 5. whoſe damſell ſhe was) and therefore this ſervant was ſo carefull to inform Boaz of her diligence and induſtry, that from morning till that time, ſhe had followed her gleaning hard, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now a little while, ſhe had reſted her ſelf there in the houſe to refreſh her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>But abide here fast by my maidens.]</hi> Who were doubtleſſe imployed,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42229:108"/>
not in gleaning, as ſome think (for the owners might not gather the gleanings of the fields, but were to leave them for the poore and for the ſtranger: Levit. 23.22. <hi>When ye reap the harvest of your land, thou ſhalt not make a clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapeſt, neither ſhalt thou gather any gleanings of thy harveſt: thou ſhalt leave them to the poore and to the ſtranger</hi>) but either in reaping, or elſe in gathering the corn after the reapers, and binding the ſheaves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>A full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Iſrael, under whoſe wings thou art come to trust.]</hi> That is, to whoſe providence, care, and protection, thou haſt committed thy ſelf, in that thou haſt joyned thy ſelf to his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is a figurative expreſſion taken from chickens, or other young birds that are ſheltred and cheriſhed under the wings of their dammes, and it is often uſed in the Scripture, as Pſal. 17.8. <hi>Keep me as the apple of the eye: hide me under the ſhadow of thy wings:</hi> and Pſal. 91.4. <hi>He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt.</hi> Two reaſons are intimated in the words, why he deſired the Lord thus to bleſſe Ruth; the one is, becauſe ſhe had carried her ſelf ſo piouſly and well to her mother in law; the other, becauſe ſhe had taken the Lord God of Iſrael to be her God, and ſo had made him her hiding place, whereby indeed the Lord was the more engaged to cheriſh and protect her. Nor need we ſtumble at it, that the good he deſires from God for Ruth, is here termed a recompence and reward; for as a father may reward the ſervice of a child, who yet ows his father all the ſervice he can do him, ſo God is ſaid to reward the good works of his ſervants, of his own free grace and fatherly love, not becauſe their works can merit any thing at Gods hand.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Let me find favour in thy ſight, my Lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou haſt ſpoken friendly unto thy handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thy hand-maids.]</hi> That is, though I be meaner then one of thy hand-maids, and therefore unworthy of ſo great favour as thou haſt afforded me, even that thou ſhouldeſt ſpeak ſo comfortably unto me, and in ſo courteous a manner; yet be pleaſed to continue thy favour unto me, for this kind and gracious reſpect of me a poore deſolate widow, emboldens me thus to crave the continuance of thy favour, however unworthy I am in my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And eat of the bread, and dip thy morſell in the vineger.]</hi> This laſt is added to imply, how freely and boldly he would have her make uſe of this liberty which he had now given her, of eating with his ſervants, that he would not have her be aſhamed, or loth to make too bold (as humble ſpirited men and women in this kind are) but that he would have her as freely take her ſhare of every thing amongſt the reſt, as if ſhe were at her own table.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And ſhe ſat beſide the reapers.]</hi> That is, when it was meal-time, ſhe came as Boaz had bidden her to eat with the ſervants, but did not boldly thruſt in her ſelf amongſt them, but modeſtly ſat down ſomewhere beſides them, as one that thought it fitting rather to receive what ſhould be given her, then to take what ſhe pleaſed her ſelf; and therefore it is added in the next words, that Boaz perceiving her modeſty, <hi>reached her parched corn,</hi> that is, new corn dryed over the fire, and made fit to eat, a food much in requeſt in thoſe times, and therefore likely to be the beſt proviſion that was now at the table, as we ſee 1. Sam. 17.17. <hi>And Jeſſe ſaid unto David his ſonne, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn,</hi> &amp;c. and 1. Sam. 25.18. and 2. Sam. 17, 28.</p>

                     <hi>And ſhe did eat, and was ſufficed, and left.]</hi> Which ſhe carried to her mother, verſ. 18. ſo that this is added both to ſhew how plentifully Boaz had given her, and how carefull ſhe was to carry ſomewhat of that which was given, to her poore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And let fall ſome of the handfulls on purpoſe for her,</hi> &amp;c.] But why did not Boaz give Ruth ſome good quantity of corn, and ſo diſpatch her back again to her mother in law, rather then bid his reapers ſcatter ſome that ſhe might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gather it up again? I anſwer, two reaſons may be given for this: for firſt, he might judge it the beſt courſe ſo to releive her wants, as withall to keep her in a way of labour, and taking pains for what ſhe got: and ſecondly, he might do it, as not deſiring there ſhould be any notice taken of his bounty in releiving her, but that ſhe ſhould gather it up, as if it had been caſually ſcattered.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And Naomi ſaid unto her, The man is near of kinne unto us, one of our next kinſmen.]</hi> Or as it is in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>one that hath right to redeem,</hi> for the next kinſman had a right by the Law of God, to redeem any houſe or land which ſhould be ſold by thoſe of their kindred, if they were not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it themſelves, Levit. 25.25. And ſo alſo to marry the widow of him that ſhould die without children, that ſo he might raiſe up ſeed to his brother, Deut. 25.5. and thus ſhe gives Ruth a hint of that, which afterward ſhe more fully imparted to her, namely, that this Boaz was indeed by the Law of God to marry her, that he might raiſe up ſeed to her deceaſed husband.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>MY daughter, ſhall I not ſeek reſt for thee, that it may be well with thee?]</hi> As if ſhe ſhould have ſaid, ſince by looking after it, there is little doubt to be made, but that Boaz may be brought to marry thee, as by the Law of God he is bound to do; ſhall I not do what I can to effect it? Hereby thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt come to live at reſt and plenty, whereas now thou indureſt much hardneſſe and ſorrow; and therefore I think my ſelf bound to do what I may, to accompliſh this for thee.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threſhing-floore,</hi> &amp;c.] Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi being to adviſe Ruth to go and lie down at the feet of Boaz, that night when he was a bed, and then to challenge of him the duty of the next kinſman, namely, that he ſhould marry her and raiſe up ſeed to her deceaſed husband, ſhe premiſeth this concerning his winnowing of barley that night, to ſhew, that by reaſon hereof, ſhe might now take as fit an opportunity both for time and place as could be expected, to put that in practiſe, which ſhe intended now to adviſe her to do, to wit, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it ſeems, it was the cuſtome of thoſe times, that either at the beginning or ending of their winnowing, the owner made ſome feaſt for his ſervants, friends, or neighbours, for that Boaz did ſo, we may with great probability gather from thoſe words, verſ. 7. <hi>When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down,</hi> &amp;c. and it may therefore well be, that the meaning of theſe words, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he winnoweth barley to night,</hi> &amp;c. is this, that he kept that night his winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42229:109"/>
feaſt; after which Naomi might well hope, that a motion of marriage made to him by Ruth, would be the more readily accepted: ſecondly, becauſe their threſh-floors in thoſe times, where they winnowed their corn, and where happely alſo they kept this their feaſt, were uſually in the open fields, and therefore there ſhe might have the more eaſie and private acceſſe to him: thirdly, becauſe the chief time of winnowing in thoſe hot countreys was toward the evening, when the wind uſually begins to riſe, called therefore, Gen. 3.8. <hi>the wind,</hi> or <hi>cool of the day,</hi> the fitteſt time for this project which Ruth was now to be put upon: and fourthly, becauſe Boaz it ſeems, was wont to lodge all night in this time of winnowing in the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing floore; partly in regard of the late working of his ſervants, to take the advantage of the evening wind, and partly to ſecure his corn, whilſt it lay in ſo open a place.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Waſh thy ſelf therefore and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, dreſſe thy ſelf handſomely in thy beſt attire, all which ſhe doubtleſſe directed her to do, that ſhe might be the more pleaſing in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And thou ſhalt go in and uncover his feet, and lay thee down.]</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Naomies aim and intention in this advice ſhe gives her daughter in law, was lawfull and honeſt; for her aim was onely to procure that Boaz, being as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the next of kinne to her deceaſed ſonne, might be brought to take Ruth to wife; that he might raiſe up feed unto the dead, as by the law of God he was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And what fault was it in Ruth to challenge that from him, to wit, marriage, which by the Law of God was due to her? yea and much might be ſaid, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the age, and gravitie, and pietie of Boaz; and the experience ſhe had many years had of Ruths modeſtie and chaſtitie, to juſtifie or excuſe the way ſhe took for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting her aims. But yet I conceive the way ſhe took in regard of ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was unwarrantable, and ſavoured much of womaniſh weakneſſe; firſt, becauſe there was an appearance of evil in it which is to be avoided, 1. Theſſ. 5.22. <hi>Abſtain from all appearance of evil:</hi> ſecondly, becauſe it was not a matter of good report; and therefore was Boaz loth to have it known, verſ. 14. <hi>And he ſaid, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floore:</hi> thirdly, becauſe it might have been an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſinne: and fourthly, becauſe it ſtood not with the modeſtie of a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thus in the night to caſt her ſelf down at a mans feet in his bed. And indeed beſides this, it might have been the means of alienating Boaz his affection from Ruth, by raiſing ſome ſuſpition in him of her immodeſtie and unchaſt life; had not God that over-ruled all, and had a ſecret guiding hand in this buſineſſe, turned it to good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he will tell thee what thou ſhalt do.]</hi> Hereby ſhe intimates how confident ſhe was, that Boaz would not refuſe the motion that was made to him, according to the Law of God; and therefore referres Ruth to the counſell he ſhould give her, for any thing that was further herein to be done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note above, verſ. 2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Spread forth thy skirt over thy handmaid, for thou art a near kinſman.]</hi> That is, accept of me for thy wife, that thou mayeſt do the duty of a kinſman, in raiſing up ſeed to my deceaſed husband. And the ground of this phraſe (as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) was a cuſtome amongſt the Iſraelites in thoſe times, that in their contracts
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42229:109"/>
the man did throw over the woman the lap or wing of his garment, in token that he took her into his protection: whence is that expreſſion alſo, Ezek. 16.8. <hi>When I paſſed by thee and looked upon thee, behold the time was the time of love; and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſſe: yea, I ſware unto thee, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>For thou haſt ſhewed more kindneſſe in the latter end, then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thou ſhewedſt much kindneſſe to thy husband deceaſed, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thine own countrey and people, and coming along with his mother for his ſake, though ſhe lived in a poore eſtate; but now to ſeek to match thy ſelf with an old man, and that for the dead ſake, to revive his name amongſt the people of God; this is a kindneſſe ſurpaſſing that.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And when ſhe came to her mother in law, ſhe ſaid, Who art thou my daughter?]</hi> By her voice her mother might know her to be a woman, but being not yet light ſhe could not diſcern her, and therefore ſhe asked who ſhe was.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen went Boaz up to the gate, and ſate him down,</hi> &amp;c.] Waiting there both for his kinſmans paſſing by, who was like to go forth into the field, or to return home from his buſineſſe abroad; and alſo for ſuch elders of the citie as might be called in to ſit in that place of judgement, for the hearing, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and witneſſing that great and weightie buſineſſe which he had in hand: and indeed accordingly it came to paſſe, as is expreſſed in the following words; <hi>And behold, the kinſman of whom Boaz ſpake came by;</hi> where this word <hi>behold,</hi> calleth the Reader to obſerve the providence of God herein, to wit, that immediately, even as Boaz expected, this kinſman came by, not being yet called or ſent for; and ſo was preſently brought to give his anſwer in this buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom he ſaid, Ho, ſuch a one, turn aſide, ſit down here.]</hi> That is, calling him by his name, he deſired him to ſit down in the gate, that he might heare what he had to ſay to him; but the penman of the Spirit here leaves out his name, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it with this indefinite clauſe <hi>(ſuch a one,)</hi> either becauſe it is not materiall that his name ſhould be expreſſed; or purpoſely, becauſe he deſerved to have his name forgotten, that took no care to raiſe up the name of his deceaſed kinſman, as God in his law had enjoyned him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And he ſaid unto the kinſman, Naomi that is come again out of the countrey of Moab, ſelleth a parcell of land,</hi> &amp;c.] It may be, that this ſale was merely pretended by Boaz for the triall of this their kinſman, that if he ſhould be forward to accept of this purchaſe, upon the right of being the next kinſman, he might thence the better be convinced, how juſt it was, that he ſhould perform the duty of a kinſman in one thing as well as in another. Yet the povertie of Naomi was not ſuch, but that ſhe might have ſome ſmall portion of land to ſell, left her by her husband by way of joynter or dowrie for term of life; and happely Ruth had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Boaz with this beforehand, though it be not expreſſed. However becauſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42229:110"/>
where ſuch lands were to be ſold by any widow, the next kinſman to whom the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance was to come after the widows deceaſe, might redeem it before any other; therefore Boaz tendred him the redeeming this land, that if he did accept of it, he might then require of him to marry Ruth, to which upon the ſame ground of being the next kinſman he was alſo bound.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Then ſaid Boaz, What day thou buyeſt the field at the hand of Naomi, thou muſt buy it alſo of Ruth,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, If you buy this land of Naomi Elimelechs widow, you muſt buy it alſo of Ruth, the widow of Mahlon, the ſonne of Elimelech, and ſo coming in as the next kinſman to buy her husbands land, you are alſo as the next kinſman to marrie her, that you may raiſe up ſeed to her deceaſed husband. Becauſe as we may probably conceive, when Naomi had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed this parcell of land as Elimelechs widow, Ruth was alſo after to enjoy it for her life, as Elimelechs ſonnes widow; and he that would challenge from Ruth the priviledge of the next kinſman, in the purchaſe of her land, was alſo to perform the duty of the next kinſman in marrying her, that he might raiſe up ſeed to her deceaſed husband, and ſo continue his name in his inheritance: hence is it, that Boaz doth here wind up theſe two thus together in theſe words that he ſpake to the next kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>thou must buy it alſo of Ruth the Moabiteſſe, the wife of the dead, to raiſe up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the kinſman ſaid, I cannot redeem it for my ſelf, leſt I marre mine own inheritance.]</hi> To wit, either becauſe his marrying with Ruth a poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, would be a great hinderance to him for his eſtate, which otherwiſe might be advanced by a rich wife; or elſe, becauſe if he ſhould happely have but one ſonne by her, that ſonne of his ſhould be called by the name of Mahlon, Ruths former hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and yet carrie away his inheritance, and ſo his name ſhould be extinguiſhed; or if he had more, yet his inheritance ſhould not go to the firſt born of his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; or rather, becauſe if he ſhould have many children by this young widow, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perhaps children already by another wife, this would be a means to marre and conſume his eſtate, by the great charge it would bring upon him; and it would alſo cauſe his inheritance to be ſhattered into too many ſeverall parcells, if it were to be divided amongſt all his ſonnes, as ſome think it was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Now this was the manner in former time in Iſrael, concerning redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a man plucked off his ſhoe, and gave it to his neighbour,</hi> &amp;c.] When the widow complained to the elders, and the kinſman notwithſtanding refuſed to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie her, in that caſe the woman was to pull off his ſhoe and ſpit in his face: Deut. 25.9. <hi>Then ſhall his brothers wife come unto him in the preſence of the Elders, and looſe his ſhoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and ſhall anſwer and ſay, So ſhall it be done to him that will not build up his brothers houſe.</hi> But here there was no ſuch thing, and therefore here the man pulled off his own ſhoe, as was the cuſtome in all other bargains of alienation. The ground of which cuſtome was this: the ſhoe ſignified the right he had to go and come at his pleaſure upon any parcell of land, as his proper demeans (for <hi>poſſeſſio,</hi> is <hi>quaſi pedum poſitio</hi>) and the pulling off a mans ſhoe and giving it to his neighbour, ſignified that he willingly did forego this his right, and reſigne it to his neighbour; and thence is that expreſſion concerning the poſſeſſing and treading down of Moab, Pſal. 60.8. <hi>Moab is my waſh pot, over E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will I cast out my ſhoe.</hi>

                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:42229:110"/>Verſ. 10. <hi>That the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, from amongſt the inhabitants of Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem, who daily go in and out at the gates of the city, and upon all civill occaſions reſort thither as to the place of judgement.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>The Lord make the woman that is come into thy houſe, like Rachel, and like Leah, which two did build the houſe of Iſrael.]</hi> Rachel is here ſet before Leah becauſe Rachel was Jacobs true and lawfull wife, and Leah was by deceit thruſt upon him; &amp; in deſiring that Ruth might be to Boaz, what Rachel and Leah were to Jacob, they deſire, 1. that ſhe may be loving &amp; amiable to him, as they were to Jacob: 2. that he might have a numerous progeny, as Jacob had by them: &amp; 3. that by this his progeny, the Iſrael, the Church of God, might be built up and increaſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And let thy houſe be like the houſe of Pharez,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as Pharez (of whoſe ſtock thou art) was bleſſed in his poſterity (though his mother was a ſtranger, and not of the ſtock of Iſrael) ſo that his children, and childrens children have been moſt honourable in the tribe of Judah, ſo mayeſt thou be bleſſed in thy children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of this poore ſtranger, and may they uphold ſtill the honour of that houſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the women her neighbours gave it a name, ſaying, There is a ſonne born to Naomi,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they gave their advice that his name ſhould be called Obed, becauſe this ſonne of Ruths was to raiſe up the name of her deceaſed husband (the ſonne of Naomi) and to be accounted his ſonne, rather then the ſonne of Boaz; therefore they do here ſay, <hi>there is a ſon born to Naomi.</hi> Indeed every where in the genealogies Obed is reckoned the ſonne of Boaz; but that is becauſe there it is fit the line ſhould be drawn according to the naturall deſcents, that we might truly know the anceſtours of whom Chriſt came, without any reſpect to this Legall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion: for doubtleſſe this child was reckoned the ſonne of Mahlon, Ruths deceaſed husband; and therefore when they would appoint a name for this child, to wit, not as taking to themſelves the power and authority of naming the child, but onely as friends giving their advice; they called him <hi>Obed,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>ſerving,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the hope they had that he would, as a good child, ſerve and comfort Naomi in her old age.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</hi> &amp;c.] The principall end of ſetting down this genealogy here, is to ſhew the truth of Jacobs prophecy concerning Chriſts coming of the tribe of Judah; and therefore it begins with Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez Judahs ſon, ver. 18. and ſo deſcendeth to David, of whoſe ſtock it was alſo known the Meſſiah was to come. How to compute the time from the birth of Boaz to the birth of David, is a matter of great difficulty: for from the going of the Iſraelites out of Egypt, to the building of the temple, it was 480. years, and therefore from the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites entring the land of Canaan, to that time, it was 440 years, out of which deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 24 years for the age of Solomon when he began to build the temple, &amp; 50. years for the age of David when Solomon was born (which is moſt probable) it will then be found that it was 366. years from the Iſraelites entring into Canaan to the birth of David, and it was not ſure long after the Iſraelites took Jericho, ere Salmon married Rahab by whom he had Boaz. But yet granting that both Boaz begat Obed when he was a very old man, and ſo Obed Jeſſe, and Jeſſe David, it might well be that in 366. years there might be no more then theſe generations.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim,</hi> &amp;c.] The two books of Samuel are ſo called, becauſe they contain the ſtorie of the life and death of Samuel, and of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael under his government: and likewiſe the ſtorie of Saul and David, who were both anointed kings by Samuel; and ſo ſhew how the prophecies of Samuel concerning them both were exactly fulfilled. Yet by the Greek and Latine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters they are uſually called the two firſt books of the Kings, becauſe therein is related how the government of Iſrael came firſt to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, from that of Judges to that of Kings; and becauſe they contain the ſtorie of Saul and David, the two firſt Kings of Iſrael. By whom theſe books were written is no where expreſſed; but that they were written by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, whoſoever the penmen were, is evident by the teſtimonie of the Jews, <hi>to whom were committed the Oracles of God;</hi> and who did alwayes acknowledge them to be a part of the ſacred canon of the Scripture; and it is likewiſe confirmed in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, where ſome paſſages of theſe books are cited as a part of the Scripture, as we may ſee Matt. 12.3, 4. where that paſſage concerning Davids eating the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, 1. Sam. 21.6. is cited by our Saviour; <hi>Have ye not read what David when he was an hungred did, and they that were with him, how he entred into the houſe of God, and did eat the ſhewbread?</hi> &amp;c. and again in thoſe two teſtimonies cited by <hi>S.</hi> Paul, the one Rom. 15.9. <hi>As it is written, For this cauſe I will confeſſe to thee amongſt the Gentiles, and ſing unto thy name;</hi> which is taken out of the 2. Sam. 22.50. and the other, Heb. 1.5. <hi>I will be to him a father, and he ſhall be to me a ſonne,</hi> which is alledged from 2. Sam. 7.14. As for theſe firſt words, <hi>Now there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man of Ramathaim-zophim,</hi> &amp;c. wherein we are told what Elkanah the father of Samuel was; we muſt know firſt, that whereas elſewhere the town where Elka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah dwelt is called Ramah, as in the 19. verſe of this chapter; <hi>And they roſe up in the morning early,—and came to their houſe to Ramah;</hi> and ſo again, chap. 2.11. here it is called <hi>Ramathaim-zophim, Ramathaim</hi> (in the duall number) becauſe it conſiſted of two towns that were called Ramah, two Ramahs joyned in one, and <hi>Zophim,</hi> either becauſe it was ſituate in the countrey or region of Zuph, whereof we reade, chap. 9.5. <hi>And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul ſaid to his ſervant that was with him, Come and let us return,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe becauſe of the high ſituation of the place, ſtanding upon ſome notable high hill, in regard whereof it may well be that there were ſome watch-towers there (for that the name ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, becauſe Zophim ſignifieth <hi>watch houſes,</hi> or <hi>towers</hi>) or elſe (as ſome think) becauſe there was there an Univerſitie or ſchool of Prophets, who are uſually in the Scripture called watchmen, as Ezek. 3.17. <hi>Sonne of man, I have made thee a watchman to the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> ſecondly, that whereas in ſetting down the genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42229:111"/>
of Elkanah, it is ſaid that <hi>he was the ſonne of Jeroham, the ſonne of Elihu, the ſonne of Tohu, the ſonne of Zuph;</hi> it ſeems in the 1. Chron. 6.26, 27. that three of theſe were alſo called by other names; for Elihu is there called Eliab, and verſ. 34. Eliel; and Tohu, Nahath, and verſ. 34. Toah; and Zuph, Zophai: and thirdly, whereas it is ſaid that Elkanah was <hi>an Ephrathite;</hi> thereby is meant that he dwelt in mount Ephraim; Elimelech and his two ſonnes are called <hi>Ephrathites,</hi> Ruth 1.2. becauſe they were of Bethlehem Ephratah; and Jeroboam is called an Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite, becauſe he was of the tribe of Ephraim, 1. Kings 11.26. but Elkanah is here called an Ephrathite, onely becauſe he dwelt in mount Ephraim; for that he was a Levite of the familie of the Kohathites; (to whom indeed certain cities were allotted in the tribe of Ephraim Joſh. 21.20.) and of the poſteritie of Korah, that wretch that was in ſo fearfull a manner deſtroyed in the wilderneſſe for his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Moſes, is evident 1. Chron. 6.22, 23, &amp;c. ſo that it is no wonder though the ſonnes of Korah were ſpared, whileſt the father was deſtroyed, ſince the Lord had determined from this curſed ſtock to raiſe up to the Iſraelites ſuch a glorious Prophet as Samuel was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.]</hi> Hannah is reckoned in the foregoing words in the firſt place; and it is probable therefore which ſome conceive, that Hannah was his firſt wife, and that afterwards he took Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah to wife, becauſe Hannah was barren: For in thoſe times they counted it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary croſſe to die without iſſue; yea becauſe the temporall promiſe made to that nation depended much upon their carnall generation, though the Lord allowed not their polygamie, yet he was pleaſed to tolerate this infirmitie in his ſervants till the Meſſiah came, when the Church ſhould no longer be tied to one nation, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall children ſhould be begotten unto God from all nations: and it may be they did conceive that Gods promiſe to Abraham of multiplying his ſeed as the ſtarres of heaven, did implie a diſpenſation granted to them for having many wives.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And this man went up out of his citie yearly to worſhip, and to ſacrifice to the Lord of hoſts in Shiloh.]</hi> At Shiloh the Tabernacle had ſtood ever ſince the ſeventh yeare of Joſhua, Joſh. 18.1. thither went Elkanah yearly, that is, at thoſe three ſolemne feaſts, wherein all the males were bound to appear before the Lord, Deut. 16.16. He might go at other times as a Levite, to do ſervice in his courſe at the Tabernacle; but here doubtleſſe his going up yearly at thoſe great feaſts is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended, when his familie went with him (yea the women alſo) ſuch was their devotion, though not bound thereto by the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the two ſonnes of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the Prieſts of the Lord were there.]</hi> This Eli was at this time Judge of Iſrael the next after Samſon, chap. 4.18. <hi>He had judged Iſrael fourtie years;</hi> and withall, as it is generally thought by all Expoſitours, he was high Prieſt too. Indeed, how he ſhould come to be high Prieſt we cannot ſay. For Aaron leaving two ſonnes behind him, Eleazar and Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, the high Prieſthood was to have deſcended ſucceſſively to the poſteritie of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azar, Aarons eldeſt ſonne; and accordingly we reade that Eleazar was high Prieſt after Aaron died, Deut. 10.6. and after Eleazar died Phinehas, Judg. 20.28. Now it is evident that Eli was of the poſteritie of Ithamar, Aarons ſecond ſonne; becauſe it appears that Abiathar who was depoſed from being high Prieſt by Solomon, was of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42229:112"/>
the poſteritie of Eli, 1. Kings 2.27. and of Ahimelech who was the ſonne of Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar, it is expreſſely ſaid, 1. Chron. 24.3. that he was <hi>of the ſonnes of Ithamar:</hi> and how therefore the high Prieſthood came to be transferred from the poſteritie of Eleazar to Eli, that was of the houſe of Ithamar, cannot be cleared by any place of Scripture; onely becauſe it is ſaid, chap. 2.30. that God had promiſed Eli that his houſe and the houſe of his father ſhould walk before him for ever; thence ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it was not without Gods appointment, that the high Prieſthood was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the houſe of Ithamar, and that becauſe the high Prieſts of Eleazars fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie had ſome way provoked God by their evil wayes, in the dayes of the former Judges. As for Elies two ſonnes Hophni and Phinenas, it is expreſſely inſerted here, that they were then in Shiloh, when Elkanah uſed yearly to go up thither to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to intimate thereby the wiſdome and pietie of Elkanah, who would not neglect his dutie in going up thither with his ſacrifices, according to the rule of Gods Law, becauſe of the horrible wickedneſſe of theſe wretches, who were of chief ſway amongſt the Prieſts that attended the ſervice of the Tabernacle; no though others ſtumbled ſo at their lewdneſſe, that chap. 2.17. they <hi>abhorred the offering of the Lord,</hi> yet El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanah would not do ſo, but went up yearly at the appointed feaſts to the houſe of God, though Hophni and Phinehas were there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>He gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her ſonnes and daughters portions.]</hi> That is, portions of the peace offerings which he offered to the Lord, the fat onely of the peace-offerings was burnt upon the altar, the right ſhoulder and the breaſt was given to the Prieſt, and the remainder of the ſacrifices were for the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to eat, and thoſe that belonged to him; of this therefore Elkanah gave portions to Peninnah and her children, according to the ancient manner of feaſts of which ſee, Gen. 43.34.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion: for he loved Hannah,</hi> &amp;c.] Peninnah had a great ſhare as having many children; for ſhe and her ſonnes and her daughters had each of them ſeverall portions; whereas Hannah being but one, was to have but a ſingle portion. But her husband therefore, becauſe he loved her dearly, as being a gracious woman, and withall, of a meek and quiet melting diſpoſition, that ſhe might not be diſcouraged, took care that her one por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be the larger and better, a double portion, (as ſome read it) and happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the choice and beſt of the ſacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And her adverſary alſo provoked her ſore,</hi> &amp;c.] This <hi>her adverſary</hi> was Peninnah (as indeed where one man, contrary to the Ordinance of God, hath two wives, they muſt needs be adverſaries, (as being corrivalls in his love) and live in continuall variance one with the other,) and ſhe <hi>provoked her ſore to make her to fret, becauſe the Lord had ſhut up her wombe:</hi> That is, ſhe provoked her purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make her vex and diſquiet her ſelf, and that by upbraiding her with her bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe, as an effect of the Lords diſpleaſure. Now this is added here, as a ſecond reaſon why Elkanah gave Hannah ſuch a <hi>worthy portion.</hi> It was not onely becauſe of the ſingular love he bare to her, but alſo becauſe he ſaw that Peninnah vexed her, and ſo he was the more carefull to comfort her and chear her up.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And as he did ſo yeare by yeare, when ſhe went up to the houſe of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſhe provoked her,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, whereas Elkanah did this yearly to chear
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42229:112"/>
Hannah, Peninnah was hereby rendred the more ready to vex her. Now this petulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Peninnah in provoking Hannah by upbraiding her with her barrennes, is hereby much aggravated, that ſhe did not forbear at thoſe times when they went up to pray, and offer ſacrifices to the Lord. See Mat. 5. And withall it implies, that ſhe upbraided her with the fruitleſſenes of her ſeeking to God ſo earneſtly at thoſe times for a child.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>So Hannah roſe up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk.]</hi> That is, after Elkanah and his family had eaten and drunk together, with whom Hannah ſat. It may be indeed that Hannah upon her husbands words, verſ. 8. did eat a little, yet it is moſt probable that ſhe did neither eat nor drink: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what ſhe ſaid afterward to Eli, verſ. 15. <hi>I have drunk neither wine nor ſtrong drink;</hi> it ſeems to have been againſt the expreſſe letter of the Law for any body to partake of theſe holy feaſts, whilſt they were in ſadneſſe and heavineſſe of ſpirit: Deut. 12.7. <hi>And there you ſhall eat before the Lord your God, and ye ſhall rejoyce in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your houſholds:</hi> Levit. 10.19. <hi>And Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron ſaid unto Moſes, Behold this day have they offered their ſinne offerings, and their burnt offerings before the Lord, and ſuch things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the ſinne offering to day, ſhould it have been accepted in the ſight of the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now Eli the Priest ſat upon a ſeat by a post of the Temple of the Lord.]</hi> That is, of the Tabernacle, for as Solomons Temple is ſometimes called a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, Jer. 10.20, <hi>My Tabernacle is ſpoyled, and all my cords are broken;</hi> ſo the Tabernacle is here called the <hi>Temple of the Lord.</hi> But yet it ſeems too, that the Tabernacle was at this time within ſome houſe built for that purpoſe in Shiloh, and hence there is mention here of <hi>a ſeat by a poſt,</hi> where Eli ſat, and afterwards of doores, chap. 3.15. <hi>And Samuel lay untill the morning, and opened the doores of the houſe of the Lord,</hi> whereas the Tabernacle had neither gates nor poſts, nor ſeats before it, but onely a vail that was hung up at the entring into it, Exod. 26.36.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And ſhe vowed a vow, and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as it followeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that if the Lord would give her a man-child, ſhe would give him unto the Lord <hi>all the dayes of his life,</hi> and that he ſhould be a Nazarite, which ſhe expreſſeth in the laſt clauſe of this verſe, and <hi>there ſhall no raſour come upon his head.</hi> Indeed being by birth a Levite, the Lords he was without her vow, as being one of that tribe whom God had ſeparated from the reſt of the people, for his ſpeciall ſervice; but then we muſt conſider that many of the Levites were diſperſed abroad in ſeverall places of the land, where their chief imployment was, to teach and inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and did not (at leaſt continually, but onely at ſome ſet times, when their courſe came) attend upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle; and again, that the Levites were not bound to the ſervice of the Tabernacle, till five and twenty or thirty years of age, and were again exempted at fifty: concerning which, ſee the note, Numb. 4.3. ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore the ſpeciall thing intended in her vow, was the conſecrating him wholly to the ſervice of the Tabernacle; or elſe, the time when he ſhould begin to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend there, that he ſhould not ſtay till the uſuall years of other Levites, but ſhould be brought thither and trained up there, even from his child-hood, and all that while continue under the ſtrict vow of a Nazarite, which ordinarily the Levites were not bound unto. As for her power to vow this; we muſt underſtand, that ſhe onely vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do what in her lay, that it might be thus, to wit, the child being by no defect
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42229:113"/>
of body or mind unfit for Gods ſervice, and willing when he came to years of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take upon him the vow; and again, her husband conſenting thereto, without which the womans vow was of no force, Deut. 30.8. <hi>But if her husband diſallow her on the day that he heard it, then he ſhall make her vow which ſhe vowed, and that which ſhe uttered with her lips, wherewith ſhe bound her ſoul, of none effect, and the Lord ſhall forgive her.</hi> Indeed it is evident in the ſequel of Samuels ſtory, that he did not alwayes continue in the Tabernacle, chap. 7.16. <hi>And he went from yeare to yeare in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Iſrael in all thoſe places:</hi> and hence it ſeems probable, that after Samuel became Judge in Iſrael, he was by ſpeciall diſpenſation from God, freed from this vow of his mother.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And Eli ſaid unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.]</hi> That is, How long wilt thou carry thy ſelf as a drunken woman? How long wilt thou continue here in thy drunkenneſſe, and profane this holy place thou art come into? go home and ſleep and rid thee of this diſtemper, and then come with a penitent heart and make thy peace with God: becauſe he ſaw her ſtand ſo long together mumblimg with her lips, after an unuſuall manner, and yet could not perceive that ſhe was praying, he perſwaded himſelf ſhe was drunk, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon did thus ſharply chide her, the rather happely inclining to this raſh judgement, becauſe of ſome incompoſedneſſe in the geſture of her body, ariſing from the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a tranſported mind, which at the ſame time he might alſo diſcern in her; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially becauſe it was immediately after they were riſen from eating and drinking before the Lord, verſ. 9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Hannah anſwered and ſaid, No, my Lord, I am a woman of a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Eli had moſt unjuſtly charged Hannah with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet we ſee with what meekneſſe ſhe ſeeks to clear her ſelf of that fault, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to underſtand, firſt, that ſhe was <hi>a woman of a ſorrowfull ſpirit,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a condition altogether unlikely to give her ſelf to ſuch exceſſe: ſecondly, that ſhe had at preſent, <hi>drunk neither wine nor ſtrong drink:</hi> and thirdly, that ſhe had been imployed in a duty, for which ſhe had been very unfit had ſhe been drunk, namely, in prayng to the Lord <hi>I have,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>powred out my ſoul before the Lord:</hi> for it is uſuall in the Scripture to call prayer the powring forth of the ſoul to God, as Pſal. 62.8. <hi>Trust in him at all times; ye people poure out your heart before him:</hi> and Lam. 2.19. <hi>Ariſe, cry out in the night; in the beginning of the watches, poure out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord:</hi> and that I conceive for theſe two reaſons, firſt, becauſe Gods ſervants are wont in prayer, as his friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, to diſcover all their ſinnes, and make known all their wants and griefs, and cares and troubles, and all the complaints and deſires of their ſouls, not hiding any thing from him: and ſecondly, becauſe they do this too, with much vehemency, and earneſtneſſe; their prayers come not from them ſleepingly, and dreamingly, but are poured forth with ſtrong affections and fervency of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Count not thy hand-maid a daughter of Belial,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, Deut. 13.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Then Eli anſwered and ſaid, Go in peace.]</hi> That is, be not troubled with that which I ſaid (for I ſee now that I was deceived) neither let this affliction thou art in diſquiet thy mind, but repoſe thy ſelf on the providence of God, who no doubt will provide for thee, as may be moſt for thy good.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>So the woman went away, &amp; did eat, and her countenance was no more ſad.]</hi> Which was an effect of faith, wrought in her by the ſpirit of God, upon the prayer ſhe had poured forth unto the Lord, and the gracious encouragement ſhe had received from the high prieſt, whoſe words ſhe entertained, as if a promiſe had been made to her from heaven.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>She bare a ſonne, and called his name Samuel.]</hi> That is, <hi>asked of God;</hi> whereof ſhe gives the reaſon in the following words, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>I have asked him of the Lord:</hi> ſo that hereby it is clear, that ſhe gave him that name, firſt, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the comfort ſhe took, in that ſhe had obtained this ſonne by prayer from the Lord; though the having of a child, a ſonne, after ſo long a time of barrenneſſe, the taking away of her reproch, and the ſtopping of her adverſaries mouth were all bleſſings, wherein ſhe could not but much rejoyce; yet that this ſonne was given her as a return of her prayer, was in her eſteem above all theſe: and ſecondly, that this name of her ſonne might put them continually in mind, in what a ſingular extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way he was given them of God, that ſo ſhe might be rendred thereby the more carefull to perform the vow ſhe had made, and her husband too having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, and that the child might be the readier to ſubmit himſelf to the ſervice of God in that ſtrict way of a Nazarite, according to that which his mother had vowed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And the man Elkanah, and all his houſe, went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly ſacrifice, and his vow.]</hi> That is, ſome ſacrifice which he had vowed to the Lord; and what can we rather think this to have been, then a vow of peace-offerings, which he had vowed to give unto the Lord, by way of thankfulneſſe, for this ſonne which by his beloved Hannah the Lord had now given him?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>She ſaid unto her husband, I will not go up untill the child be weaned,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby it appears that Hannah had acquainted her husband with her vow, and that he had conſented to it. Some Expoſitours queſtion whether Hannahs keeping the child at home till he was weaned, was not a tranſgreſſion of the law; but cauſeleſſely, for firſt, for that Law concerning the preſenting the firſt born before the Lord, which the Virgin Mary obſerved, Luke 2.22. <hi>And when the dayes of her purification were accompliſhed, they brought him to Jeruſalem to preſent him before the Lord:</hi> this concerned not the Levites, but onely thoſe firſt born that were to be redeemed: and ſecondly, for that Law concerning the appearing of all the males thrice a yeare before the Lord, Exod. 23.17. <hi>three times in a yeare all thy males ſhall appear before the Lord God:</hi> it was meant onely of thoſe that were capable in ſome meaſure of joyning in the worſhip and ſervice of God. Hannah therefore was not bound to go up with her young child immediately, and being not bound ſhe chooſeth rather to ſtay till he was weaned; becauſe it went againſt her, to think of bringing away a child vowed to God, after ſhe had once brought him to the Tabernacle of the Lord; reſolving that after he was weaned, ſhe would then carry him and leave him there, that he might continue in the ſervice of the Lord for ever. Concerning which ſee the foregoing note upon verſe 11.</p>

This word of the Lord which Elkanah ſpeaks of, muſt either be the gracious anſwer which Eli returned to Hannah, verſ. 17. <hi>Then Eli anſwered, and ſaid, Go in peace, and the God of Iſrael grant thee thy petition which thou hast asked of him:</hi> which ſhe took as a kind of promiſe ſent her from heaven, or rather the anſwer which God returned to her prayers, by giving her a ſonne, which was all one at if a voice had come from heaven, Hannah thy deſire is granted; and this word it is, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Lord would eſtabliſh; ſhe had not onely craved a ſonne, but alſo with this condition by way of vow annexed, that he might live a perpetuall Nazarite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the ſervice of God, and in this he prayes that the Lord would perfect what he had begun: or elſe it muſt be underſtood generally that God would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he had determined concerning this his ſonne, as taking it for granted, that ſurely a child ſo miraculouſly given, was determined for ſome great ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>She took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of floure.]</hi> There is mention afterwards of the ſacrificing of one of theſe bullocks onely, verſ. 25: <hi>And they ſlew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli:</hi> but it cannot be thence gathered, that one onely was intended for ſacrifices, the other for other uſes; that one might be offered when they preſented the child, and delivered him up to the ſervice of God, (which is therefore onely mentioned) the other afterwards in other oblations; or the one might be offered as a burnt offering, the other for a peace offering. As for the Ephah of floure which he carried alſo; an ephah contained ten omers or tenth deales; now the Law perſcribing three tenth deales to be offered with a bullock, Num. 15.9. <hi>Then ſhall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth-deales of floure, mingled with half an hin of oyle,</hi> nine tenth-deales of this ephah were for the three bullocks, and the other tenth deale which was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, might be intended for a voluntary meat-offering.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>MY heart rejoyceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] In this ſong of Hannahs, her drift is to ſet forth the praiſes of God, by way of teſtifying her thankfulneſſe for the great mercy he had ſhown to her in her ſonne Samuel; yet ſhe doth not onely inſiſt upon this particular, but takes occaſion from thence to ſet forth his infinite holineſſe, and wiſdome, and power, and ſpeaks of the marvellous works of his providence which he dayly doth in the world; and of the manifold benefits both temporall, and ſpirituall, and eternall, which he is alwayes ready to impart to his Church and people. Indeed in the firſt words of the ſong, ſhe begins with that which God at preſent had done for her; wherein we muſt note, firſt, that though ſhe did doubtleſſe rejoyce much in the child that God had given her; yet the chief thing that cheared her heart was, that the Lord by granting her requeſt in giving her a ſonne, had diſcovered his love to her, and the precious account that he made of her, and therefore when ſhe comes to ſet forth the ground of her joy, ſhe inſiſts altogether upon her intereſt in God, and his favour to her: <hi>My heart rejoyceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord:</hi> ſecondly, that by exalting her horn, is meant the advancing of her power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the cheerfulneſſe and joy of her ſpirit; the metaphor is taken either from horn beaſts whoſe power and beautie is chiefly in their horns, and who being lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and full of ſpirit, do the more advance and lift up their horns as they go up and down; or elſe from captains and ſouldiers, who were wont in thoſe times (as ſome ſay) to wear a kind of horn made of braſſe upon their helmets, and when they were conquerers and triumphed over their enemies, then they wore it up, but when they were conquered and foiled, they drew it down. However, Hannah intends hereby to intimate, that through the Lords goodneſſe to her in giving her a ſonne, ſhe was become ſtronger and more renowned then before (for children are the ſtrength and glorie of their parents) and that ſhe was cheared and encouraged to triumph over all her enemies: thirdly, that whereas ſhe addes, <hi>my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;</hi> thereby is meant, both that ſhe had now more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant matter for the praiſing of God then her enemies, and likewiſe that ſhe had now enough to ſay wherewith to ſtop the mouth of her inſulting adverſarie; before, when ſhe was barren, ſhe had nothing to replie againſt Peninnah, but was fain to bear her reproches in ſilence; but now Peninnah could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over her as before; and if ſhe did, ſhe had enough to anſwer her: and fourthly, that the reaſon of this is rendred in the laſt words, <hi>becauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thy ſalvation,</hi> that is, becauſe thou haſt ſaved me, to wit, from the affliction and reproch of my barrenneſſe, and the inſulting of mine enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>There is none holy as the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe there is no creature that is perfectly holy without ſpot or blemiſh, eſſentially and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently holy, and the fountain of all holineſſe that is in others, as the Lord is; and therefore it follows, <hi>for there is none beſides thee,</hi> that is, there is no God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thee, <hi>neither is there any rock like our God:</hi> but concerning this laſt clauſe, ſee the note, Deut. 32.4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>For the Lord is a God of knowledge,</hi> &amp;c.] By two reaſons Hannah ſhews
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42229:115"/>
the follie of thoſe that proudly inſult over Gods people: firſt, <hi>the Lord,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>is a God of knowledge,</hi> that is, a God that knows all that in your pride and arrogancie you think or ſpeak, or attempt againſt his poore ſervants; and from whom you have even that knowledge, wiſdome and underſtanding, in the confidence whereof you are ſo ready to exalt your ſelves; wherein there are many ſtrong arguments included to diſſwade all men and women from ſuch proud and arrogant boaſting as Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah had uſed: firſt, becauſe he that is the juſt avenger of all wickedneſſe, muſt needs know it: ſecondly, becauſe he diſcerning all their thoughts and projects, could eaſily infatuate them, and croſſe them many wayes in their purpoſes: and thirdly, becauſe they may be ſure, that he ordereth all with great wiſdome for the good of thoſe that fear his name. Again, a ſecond reaſon is, that <hi>by him actions are weighed:</hi> whereby is meant that he exactly ponders all the actions of men, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a juſt Judge repay them as he finds them good or evil; yea, according to the degree of good and evil which he finds in them; or rather it is meant of all the actions of men, as they are diſpoſed by the providence of God; that he weighs them, that is, he orders them in great wiſdome; even as the Apothecarie weighs the drugs he puts into his medicines, ſo the Lord moderates or enlargeth the rage of wicked men againſt his children, as may be moſt for their good; and therefore though they be inſatiably deſirous to lay load upon his children, yet they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained many times, and can proceed no further then God ſees ſhall be for their good.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that ſtumbled are girt with ſtrength.]</hi> In theſe words is implied that God doth many times abate the ſtrength of the mightie, or at leaſt blaſts their attempts, and makes them ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeleſſe; and ſo (as when the bow of a mightie man breaks) all their endeavours come to nothing; and on the other ſide he many times ſo ſtrengthens the feeble that of themſelves are ready to ſtumble, or at leaſt ſo proſpers their weak endeavours, that unexpectedly they bring mightie things to paſſe. Thoſe that are ſtrong of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſtrong in militarie forces, in power and authoritie in the Common-wealth, in wiſedome, wit, judgement and memorie, become many times as Samſon when his hair was cut off, <hi>like other men,</hi> yea though their ſtrength remains, their bow is oft broken, their attempts are vain, and end in ſhame and reproch; whereas thoſe that are weak in theſe regards, become mightie and ſtrong, at leaſt they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſucceſſefully in all their affairs.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>They that were full have hired out themſelves for bread, and they that were hungry ceaſed.]</hi> That is, they that were hungry became rich, or at leaſt were well provided for, ſo that there was not a poore man any longer left amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So that the barren hath born ſeven, and ſhe that hath many children is waxed feeble].</hi> That is, thoſe that were barren have born many children; (for ſeven is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Scripture put for many, as Deut. 28.7. <hi>they ſhall come out againſt thee one way, and flie before thee ſeven wayes:</hi> and ſo in divers other places) and on the other ſide, they that have had many children have either grown weak, and ſo through feebleneſſe have left bearing, or elſe have buried the children they have had, and ſo became feeble, children being ſtill eſteemed the ſtrength of their parents. Now this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42229:115"/>
particular paſſage of Gods providence, it is likely that Hannah did the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt the reſt, as having reſpect to the Lords mercy, in opening her barren wombe, and perhaps to the hope ſhe had alſo, if not the aſſurance ſhe had by the ſpirit of prophecy, that the Lord would give her many children more, as indeed we find verſ. 21. of this chapter, that ſhe had after this, three ſonnes and two daughters.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>The Lord killeth and maketh alive,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe following paſſages in this and the next verſe may either be meant of ſeverall men, to wit, that <hi>the Lord kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> one, <hi>and maketh alive</hi> another, that he maketh one man poore, and another man rich, &amp;c. or elſe of the ſame perſons; that the Lord killeth men, and then maketh them alive again; that he maketh a man poore, and then afterwards rich again, that he bringeth a man low, and then afterwards lifteth him up again. <hi>The Lord maketh poore, and maketh rich; he bringeth low, and lifteth up:</hi> as for theſe expreſſions of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and making alive, of bringing down to the grave, and bringing up, though they may be meant firſt, literally, that the Lord ſometimes killeth men, and yet reſtoreth them to life again, as he did the good Shunamites ſonne, 2. Kings 4.35. and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpiritually, that the Lord with the terrours of the Law, and the laſhes and ſting of conſcience for ſinne hath humbled men, and laid them as it were for dead accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>ſinne revived, and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9. whence the Law is called <hi>the miniſtration of death,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.7. and yet afterwards he revives them, and cheers them up again by the promiſes of mercy and the ſweet comforts of his ſpirit; yet thirdly, I conceive they may be beſt underſtood of the deſperate dangers, the grievous and heavy afflictions, whereinto the Lord many times brings men, and yet afterwards raiſeth them up again; when men by ſickneſſe or any other diſmall calamity, are brought to deſperate extremities of danger, heart-breaking ſorrows and miſeries, out of which there ſeems to be no hope of recovery, they are ſaid in the Scripture to be as dead men, and to be brought to the brink of the grave; <hi>there is but a ſtep between me and death,</hi> ſaith David, chap. 20.3. <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all the day long,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.36. and ſo alſo when the Lord delivereth them from theſe dangers and miſeries, they are ſaid to be revived and raiſed up from the grave, Hoſ. 6.2. <hi>After two dayes will he revive us, in the third day will he raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight:</hi> Eſa. 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my dead body ſhall they ariſe; awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt,</hi> &amp;c. And thus Hannah here ſpeaks of the ſtrange changes and alterations which God makes amongſt men. <hi>The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up:</hi> becauſe, firſt, men will not be humbled many times, till they be brought to ſuch depths of miſerie: and ſecondly, men are moſt affected with Gods goodneſſe when they have given themſelves for loſt, and are then raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: &amp; thirdly, the Lords power is moſt magnified, when men are reſtored from ſuch inextricable miſeries; therefore uſually the Lord doth thus kill men, when he means nothing leſſe then that they ſhould be loſt, but within a while revives them again, and puts them into a better eſtate and condition then they were in before.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>For the pillars of the earth are the Lords, and he hath ſet the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.]</hi> That is, the whole earth is the Lords, even to the centre and foundation thereof, upon which the Lord hath ſettled and built up the whole frame of the world, as it were upon pillars. The earth hangs we know in the midſt of the aire, having
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42229:116"/>
nothing to ſupport it but the mighty power &amp; command of God; but becauſe it ſtands firm and faſt as if it were ſupported with pillars, hence is this expreſſion, <hi>The pillars of the earth are the Lords,</hi> &amp;c. and this clauſe is added, to ſhew that it is no wonder, that God ſhould thus turn things upſide down in the government of the world, as is expreſſed in the foregoing verſe; ſince he that thus made the world at the firſt, muſt needs be of power to do what he will, &amp; may well alſo take libertie to do what ſeems good in his own eyes; for with his own why ſhould he not do what himſelf pleaſeth?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>He will keep the feet of his ſaints, and the wicked ſhall be ſilent in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.]</hi> By keeping the feet of his ſaints, is meant the Lords preſerving them from all dangers bodyly and ſpirituall; and that eſpecially by the inward guidance of his ſpirit; and as for the ſecond clauſe, <hi>the wicked ſhall be ſilent in darkneſſe;</hi> this may be underſtood either of the great calamities that ſhall fall upon them; Eccleſ. 5.17. <hi>All his dayes alſo he eateth in darkneſſe, and he hath much ſorrow and wrath with his ſickneſſe:</hi> Zeph. 1.15. <hi>That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and diſtreſſe, a day of waſtneſſe and deſolation, a day of darkneſſe and gloomineſſe, a day of clouds and thick darkneſſe:</hi> wherein Hannah foretells here that they ſhould be ſilent, that is, even overwhelmed with confuſion and aſtoniſhment, not having any thing to ſay for themſelves, according to thoſe expreſſions, Matth. 22.12. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, friend how cameſt thou in hither, not having a wedding garment: and he was ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe:</hi> Job 5.16. <hi>So the poore hath hope, and iniquitie ſtoppeth her mouth:</hi> and Jer. 8.14. <hi>Why do ye ſit ſtill? aſſemble your ſelves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be ſilent there: for the Lord our God hath put us to ſilence, and given us waters of gall to drink, becauſe we have ſinned againſt the Lord:</hi> or elſe of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off from the land of the living, for ſuch are ſaid to dwell in ſilence, Pſal. 94.17. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe the Lord had been my help, my ſoul had almoſt dwelt in ſilence,</hi> and in darkneſſe: Job 10.21, 22. <hi>Before I go whence I ſhall not return, even to the land of darkneſſe, and the ſhadow of death:</hi> and eſpecially the wicked, whoſe ſouls are caſt into outer darkneſſe, Matth. 8.12. <hi>But the children of the kingdome ſhall be caſt into outer darkneſſe, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For by ſtrength ſhall no man prevail.]</hi> That is, by their own ſtrength. This is added as a reaſon of both the foregoing clauſes, <hi>the Lord will keep the feet of his ſaints;</hi> for ſhould not the Lord keep them, they could never preſerve themſelves by their own ſtrength; <hi>and the wicked ſhall be ſilent in darkneſſe:</hi> for if the Lord undertakes to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, they cannot by their ſtrength ſecure themſelves; the weak and ſtrong are both alike to him; he can pull down the mightieſt as well as the meaneſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>The adverſaries of the Lord ſhall be broken in pieces, out of heaven ſhall he thunder upon them.]</hi> This laſt clauſe being a branch of the propheticall part of Hannahs ſong, may have reference to that particular judgement upon the enemies of Gods people, in the time of her ſonne Samuels government, 1. Sam. 7.10. <hi>The Lord thundred with a great thunder on that day upon the Philiſtines, &amp; diſcomfited them, &amp; they were ſmitten before Iſrael;</hi> or that 1. Sam. 12.18. <hi>So Samuel called unto the Lord, and the Lord ſent thunder and rain that day; &amp; all the people greatly feared the Lord &amp; Samuel.</hi> Yet withall it may be meant generally of the Lords pouring down venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from heaven upon his adverſaries; for we ſee, 2. Sam. 22.14, 15. David ſaith, <hi>The Lord thundred from heaven, and the moſt high uttered his voice; and he ſent out ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and ſcattered them, lightning and diſcomfited them,</hi> &amp;c. And yet we reade not of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42229:116"/>
any ſuch ſtorm of thunder and lightning that ever fell upon the enemies of David; becauſe God had many times deſtroyed his enemies by thunder from heaven, it grew to be, as it ſeems, a proverbiall ſpeech, to ſay that the Lord would thunder upon them, when they meant that the Lord would terribly deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord ſhall judge the ends of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] This is a prophecie concerning the exaltation &amp; kingdome of Chriſt the Meſſiah; and indeed it is the firſt place in the old Teſtament, where Chriſt is mentioned under the name of the Meſſiah, the anointed. <hi>The Lord ſhall judge the ends of the earth, &amp; he ſhall give ſtrength unto his king, &amp; exalt the horn of his anointed;</hi> that is, the Lord ſhall rule the whole world, and at the laſt day he ſhall judge all the inhabitants of the earth, yea and that by the Meſſiah, the Lord Chriſt his anointed King, who though at firſt he ſhall live in a low and mean eſtate and condition, yet when he hath finiſhed the work of mans redemption, he ſhall then be exalted above all principalities and powers, and ſhall ſit down at the right hand of his father: all power ſhall be given him both in heaven and in earth, he ſhall gather in his elect people among all nations, govern them by his word and ſpirit, and deſtroy all his and their enemies. Thus, I ſay, it is generally thought by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, that theſe words are a prophecie concerning Chriſt the Lords anointed; yet in regard the kingdome afterward eſtabliſhed amongſt the Jews was a figure of the kingdome of Chriſt, it may alſo be well underſtood of that.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the Prieſt.]</hi> This is repeated again, verſ. 18. where it is alſo added that in his miniſtring before the Lord he was girded <hi>with a linen Ephod.</hi> It is expreſſely ſaid in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſ. 24. that Samuel was carried by his parents to the Tabernacle, and left there ſo ſoon as even he was weaned. But we cannot poſſibly think that there was any ſervice of the Tabernacle, that at thoſe years Samuel was able to do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meaning of this clauſe is onely, that afterwards, even whileſt he was yet but a child, de did ſuch ſervice in the Tabernacle, as according to his years and ſtrength he was capable of doing. The Levites indeed did not enter upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle till they were twentie five years old, Levit. 8.24. But now Samuels caſe was extraordinary, becauſe by the ſpeciall vow of a Nazarite, he was even from his tender years conſecrated to the ſervice of the Lord; and therefore we ſee even in his childhood he did wait upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle, to wit, in ſuch ſervices as ſtill by degrees he grew able to do; as happely in locking and unlocking the doores of the Tabernacle; in laying up and fetching out the veſtments of the Prieſts, and ſuch like; for that it was ſome miniſterie in the Tabernacle that he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in is evident, becauſe verſ. 18. it is ſaid, that he wore a linen Ephod, which was an holy garment, in the doing of it. We find not indeed in the law of Moſes that there was any ſuch linen Ephods appointed for the Levites, but for the inferiour Prieſts onely, the ſonnes of Aaron, Exod. 39.27. <hi>And they made coats of fine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen of woven work, for Aaron and for his ſonnes:</hi> either therefore afterwards when the Tabernacle came to be ſettled in the land of Canaan, it was ordered, and that by divine authoritie, that the Levites alſo ſhould wear ſuch linen Ephods when they attended upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle; or elſe Samuel was by ſpeciall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, becauſe of the Nazarites vow, or ſome other reaſon, appointed to wear this holy veſtment; which yet ſeems not ſo probable, becauſe it appears that this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42229:117"/>
Ephod was ſo commonly worn by all that were employed in holy ſervices, that even David alſo when he danced before the Ark, 2. Sam. 6.14. <hi>was girded with a linen Ephod.</hi> However, hereby I ſay it is clear, that Samutl in his childhood and youth did attend upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle, in ſuch ſervices as he could then diſcharge, and that <hi>before Eli the Priest,</hi> that is, according as he was ordered and directed by Eli, who undertook the training of him up, and upon whom he chiefly attended in the ſervice he did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Now the ſonnes of Eli were ſonnes of Belial, they knew not the Lord.]</hi> This is meant of the effectuall knowledge of faith; ſo they knew not the Lord, they had no lively knowledge nor apprehenſion of God. They that have a floating knowledge in their brains of thoſe things which they believe not in their hearts, may be well ſaid not to know that which by a ſpeculative knowledge they underſtand well enough; and ſo they that underſtand well enough thoſe things which God hath revealed concerning himſelf, either by his word or works, if this their knowledge be not accompanied with faith and the fear of God; (and ſo though they know God, yet they do not glorifie him as God, Rom. 1.21.) theſe men do not indeed know God; they may ſay they know him, but their own works may confute them; for if they did indeed know him, they would fear him and honour him as God: <hi>They profeſſe that they know God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle concerning ſuch men as theſe, Tit. 1.16. <hi>but in their works they denie him, being abominable and diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. He that ſaith, I know him</hi> (ſaith <hi>S.</hi> John, 1. John 2.4.) <hi>and keepeth not his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him:</hi> and thus it is ſaid here of the ſonnes of Eli, that <hi>they knew not the Lord:</hi> Though they were Prieſts, whoſe office it was to teach and inſtruct the people in the knowledge of God, yet becauſe they were wicked ungodly wretches, <hi>ſonnes of Belial</hi> (concerning which expreſſion ſee the note, Deut 13.13.) therefore they are ſaid not to have known the Lord; as upon the ſame ground the Prophet Hoſea complained of the people of God in his time, that there was no knowledge of God in the land. Hoſ. 4.1. And this is here inſerted concerning the ſonnes of Eli, to intimate both the faith of Samuels parents in leaving him, and alſo the ſingular grace of God in preſerving him pure and incorrupt, where there was ſuch danger of infection by reaſon of theſe ſonnes of Belial with whom he was to live.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>The Priests ſervant came, whileſt the fleſh was in ſeething, with a fleſh-hook of three teeth in his hand,</hi> &amp;c.] Concerning this fleſh-hook ſee Exod. 27.3. The ſinne of theſe ſonnes of Eli here ſet forth was this, firſt, that not content with the breaſt and ſhoulder which onely were the Prieſts portion of the peace-offerings, Levit. 7.31, 32, 33, 34. they uſed to take out of that which was ſeething for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, as their cuſtomarie fees, not having any Law of God for it, all that their fleſh-hook could take out; and it is ſaid that this they did not now and then, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, verſ. 14. <hi>So they did in Shiloh, unto all the Iſraelites that came thither:</hi> Again, ſometimes they would have this their overplus cuſtomarie portion before the fleſh was ſeething, that they might roſt it, yea before the fat was burnt, directly againſt that Law, Levit. 7.31. <hi>And the Prieſt ſhall burn the fat upon the altar, but the breast ſhall be Aarons and his ſonnes;</hi> yea, and perhaps before the fat was taken off, which may be the reaſon why verſ. 29. they are ſaid to have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fat with the chiefeſt of the offerings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:42229:117"/>Verſ. 18. <hi>But Samuel miniſtred before the Lord being a child girded with a linen Ephod.]</hi> See the note above, verſ. 11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from yeare to yeare,</hi> &amp;c.] During his childhood, when as yet he could do but little ſervice in the Tabernacle, his mother thought it requiſite to ſupplie him with clothes, the rather that ſhe might yearly bring him ſome ſmall pledge of a mothers love.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And the Lord viſited Hannah, ſo that ſhe conceived and bare three ſonnes and two daughters.]</hi> Thus for that one ſonne which ſhe had given to the Lord, the Lord gave her three ſonnes and two daughters more, and that too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon Elies bleſſing them, to ſhew how powerfull the prayers are of ſuch as Eli was, verſ. 20. it is ſaid Eli bleſſed Elkanah and his wife, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord give thee ſeed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord;</hi> and then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after follows, <hi>And the Lord viſited Hannah, ſo that ſhe conceived,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his ſonnes did unto all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and how they lay with the women,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he heard both of the wrong they did unto all Iſrael, in the matter of their ſacrifices, and likewiſe of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular villanie of theirs, in lying <hi>with the women that aſſembled at the doore of the Tabernacle of the congregation:</hi> It is very hard to ſay what theſe women were, with whom the ſonnes of Eli committed this lewdneſſe; firſt, ſome hold that they were certain devout women that withdrawing themſelves from all worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſecular affairs, did give up themſelves wholly to the ſervice of God in the Tabernacle; there to ſpend their time in faſting and prayer, and other holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both day and night; of which ſort they ſay that propheteſſe Anna was one, of whom it is ſaid, Luke 2.37. <hi>She was a widow of about foureſcore and foure years, which departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with fastings and prayers night and day:</hi> ſecondly, others hold that they were certain women that did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together in their turns, ſome in one courſe, and ſome in another, for ſome ſervices in the Tabernacle that were proper for them to do, as waſhing and ſpinning; and ſo had their abode for that purpoſe in ſome places adjoyning to the Tabernacle; and did attend at the doore of the Tabernacle to receive directions from the Prieſts as there was occaſion: thirdly, others ſay that they were the women that after child-bearing came to be purified according to the Law, who being accompanied, when they came with a great many of their neighbours and friends that went along with them, it is therefore ſaid that they <hi>aſſembled by troops</hi> (as the word in the Original ſignifieth) <hi>at the doore of the Tabernacle of the congregation:</hi> and laſtly, others think that it is meant generally of all thoſe women, that in the forwardneſſe of their zeal and devotion did flock together daily at the doore of the Tabernacle, to offer ſacrifices, and to perform other duties of Gods worſhip and ſervice; and indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the ſame phraſe is uſed concerning thoſe women that came flocking in to bring their looking-glaſſes for the ſervice of the Tabernacle (at which time there could not be any ſuch companies of women, that had either conſecrated themſelves to the perpetuall ſervice of God in the Tabernacle, or that came up in their courſes to be helpfull in their way to the miniſters of the Tabernacle; and that becauſe the Tabernacle was not then built) Exod. 38.8. <hi>And he made the lave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tabernacle of the congregation,</hi> I do the rather think it is meant of all ſuch women generally, as came in freely and frequently to ſerve God in the Tabernacle, and that many of theſe were ſeduced by theſe varlets, as they got opportunity of any privacy with them, and drawn to lie with them, and that in Gods houſe; a wickedneſſe the more abominable too, becauſe they had wives of their own, chap. 4.19. As for the mention that is here made of Elies age, <hi>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his ſonnes did,</hi> &amp;c. I conceive there are two reaſons why this is expreſſed; firſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate why he himſelf never took notice of theſe vilde pranks that his ſonnes played; being very aged and ſo not being able, frequently to attend himſelf upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle, he never knew of theſe things till others told him of it: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as an aggravation of his affliction in the wickedneſſe of his ſonnes, that it fell upon him in his old age; to heare ſuch tydings of his ſonnes, would have been a burthen heavy enough to have been born when he was in his full ſtrength, but in his old age, when the graſſehopper is a burden, as Solomon ſaith, Eccleſ. 12.5. to have ſuch milſtones fall upon him, muſt needs cruſh him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Why do you ſuch things?</hi> &amp;c.] Thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth his ſonnes for their ſinnes; but herein lay the ſinne of Eli, that knowing them guilty of ſuch horrid abominations he thought it enough to reprove them, and that ſo gently too, <hi>Nay my ſonnes, for it is no good report that I heare,</hi> &amp;c. For ſuch villanies as theſe of his ſonnes, that were now diſcovered to him, he could have done no leſſe in juſtice then to have turned them out of the prieſthood, yea to have cut them off from the people of God; and therefore inſtead of that juſt ſeverity thus mildly to admoniſh them onely, was certainly a grievous ſinne; and indeed it diſcovered plainly he had alwayes marred them with too much indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; ſo that it is no wonder though the Lord were highly offended with him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Ye make the Lords people to tranſgreſſe.]</hi> If we reade this clauſe as it is in the margin of our bibles, <hi>Ye make the Lords people to cry out,</hi> it is do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>If one man ſinne against another, the Judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſinne against the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?]</hi> That is, though all the friends he hath ſhould joyn together and intreat, they ſhall not be able to make his peace. This ſpeech of Eli to his ſonnes, is ſomewhat difficult, and is diverſly expounded; ſome underſtand it thus, that whereas when one man wrongs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Judge or umpire choſen between, may compoſe the difference and reconcile them together, it is otherwiſe when a man wittingly, maliciouſly, and preſumptuouſly ſinnes againſt God; for there all hope of pardon is denied, <hi>there remains no more ſacrifice for ſinne,</hi> that is, for ſuch a mans ſinne,

Heb. 10.26. neither ſhould ſuch an one be prayed for: 1. John 5.16. <hi>If any man ſee his brother ſinne a ſinne, which is not unto death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſinne not unto death. There is a ſinne unto death: I do not ſay, he ſhall pray for it.</hi> But this Expoſition agreeth not with Eli his aim, which was doubtleſſe to winne his ſonnes to true repentance; and beſides, why ſhould ſinning againſt the Lord, be here reſtrained to ſinning againſt him malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and with a high hand? I rather therefore think, that the drift of theſe words is onely to ſhew them what a grievous and dangerous thing ſinne is, eſpecially ſuch ſinnes whereby God is immediately wronged and provoked, that ſo he might ſcarre them from their evil courſes; to wit, either becauſe if God by his Judges puniſh offences againſt man, he muſt needs be more ſevere when men riſe againſt him; or elſe becauſe no mediation nor ſatisfaction by man can here take up the quarrell; as may be done when the difference is between one man and another: <hi>If one man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſinne againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him;</hi> that is, an Umpire may come and take up the controverſie; the partie may be adjudged to make ſatisfaction, and there will be an end of the quarrell; <hi>but if a man ſinne against the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> that is, no mediation nor ſatisfaction of man can here make a mans peace; no reconciliation can be here hoped for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſinner repenting of his ſinnes, do by faith in Chriſt turn to God. So that herein alſo is implied the deſperate danger of their condition, who by kicking againſt the ſacrifices, did in a manner deſpiſe this onely means of their reconciliation with God.</p>

                     <hi>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.]</hi> That is, becauſe the Lord had determined to deſtroy them; and ſo conſequently not to give them grace to repent, but to leave them to the ſtubborneſſe of their own wicked hearts; for though it be true, that God wills not the death of a ſinner, (Ezek. 33.11. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live;</hi> that is, he deſires not that ſinners ſhould periſh, but would rather that they ſhould repent, &amp;c.) yet it doth not hence follow, but that God may determine in a way of juſtice, not to give any effectuall grace to ſuch and ſuch men, as have grievouſly provoked him by their ſinnes, but rather to deliver them up to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, and ſo it was here; for their ſinnes God determined to deſtroy them, and conſequently to leave them to themſelves; and therefore it was no wonder though they minded not the reproofs and counſell of their father.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and alſo with men.]</hi> This is here inſerted, firſt, for the greater praiſe of Samuel, who grew in grace even in theſe declining times: and ſecondly, eſpecially to ſhew how God remembred mercie in the midſt of judgement, by raiſing up ſuch a glorious inſtrument to be a ſtay to his poore people, in thoſe diſmall times that were now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon them.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And the man of thine whom I ſhall not cut off from mine altar, ſhall be to conſume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart.]</hi> That is, thoſe of thy poſteritie that ſhall not be cut off, ſhall live miſerably, pining away with grief and vexation of heart, becauſe they ſhall ſee the adverſarie familie enjoy their honour: for ſtill that which is ſaid of Elies eyes and heart, is meant of the eyes and heart of his poſteritie.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And I will raiſe me up a faithfull Prieſt, that ſhall do according to that which is in mine heart,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Zadok of the familie of Eleazar, who did faithfully cleave to Solomon, whom the Lord had appointed to ſucceed David in the throne, when Abiathar who was of the poſteritie of Eli, conſpired with Adonijah againſt David, and againſt Solomon, 1. Kings 1.7, 8. whereupon it was, that he was afterwards depoſed by Solomon from being high Prieſt, and Zadok, was made high Prieſt in his ſtead, 1. Kings 2.27. Now concerning this Zadok there is a promiſe here made, <hi>I will build him a ſure houſe, and he ſhall walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine anointed for ever:</hi> Where firſt, by building him a ſure houſe, is meant the multiplying of his familie, together with the proſperitie they ſhould enjoy in every reſpect; and more particularly the eſtabliſhing of his offspring in the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and ſettling of the high Prieſts place upon them: for thus we find this phraſe of building men a houſe uſed elſewhere, as Deut. 25.9. <hi>So ſhall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brothers houſe:</hi> and Exod. 1.21. <hi>And it came to paſſe, becauſe the midwives feared God, that he made them houſes:</hi> and 2. Sam. 7. where that which the Lord ſaid to David concerning Solomon, verſ. 13. <hi>I will eſtabliſh the throne of his kingdome for ever,</hi> is thus afterwards repeated by David, verſ. 27. <hi>For thou, O Lord of hoſts, God of Iſrael, haſt revealed to thy ſervant, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe.</hi> And indeed we find accordingly, that the high prieſthood was continued in the line and poſteritie of Zadok, unto the time of the Babylonian captivitie; Ezek. 44.15. <hi>But the Prieſts, the Levites, the ſonnes of Zadok, that kept the charge of my Sanctuary, when the children of Iſrael went aſtray from me, they ſhall come near to me to minister unto me,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo Zadok being of the poſteritie of Phinehas the ſonne of Eleazar, that promiſe was made good which the Lord made to Phinehas, Num. 25.13. <hi>He ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the covenant of an everlaſting prieſthood:</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by his walking before the Lords anointed for ever, is meant that Zadok and his poſteritie ſhould perform ſuch ſervices as belonged to the high Prieſt, for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon and his ſucceſſours, by enquiring of the Lord for them, by offering ſacrifices for them; yea and by giving them counſel and advice upon every occaſion, &amp;c. yet ſome conceive too, that this laſt clauſe muſt alſo be referred to Chriſt the Lords anointed, of whom both Solomon and his ſucceſſours were types; and who was at his coming to aboliſh the Leviticall prieſthood.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>Every one that is left in thy houſe, ſhall come and crouch to him for a piece of ſilver,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thoſe of thy poſteritie that ſhall not be cut off, ſhall come and bow and crouch before the poſteritie of Zadok to beg ſome relief, and to ſue that they may be employed, though it were but in ſome of the meaneſt ſervices of the Temple; onely that they may have bread wherewith to ſuſtain themſelves and indeed if we yield what is moſt probable, to wit, that the Prieſts were many times degraded for their evil deeds, and turned out of their office; it needs not ſeem ſtrange, that many of Elies poſteritie ſhould fall into ſuch extreme povertie and miſerie. Some conceive that we have ſome footſteps of this curſe in that which
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42229:120"/>
is ſaid of the Prieſts that were not of Zadoks poſteritie, Ezek. 44.13, 14. <hi>And they ſhall not come near unto me to do the office of a Prieſt unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the moſt holy place: but they ſhall bear their ſhame and their abominations which they have committed: But I will make them keepers of the charge of the houſe, for all the ſervice thereof, and for all that ſhall be done therein.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the word of the Lord was precious in thoſe dayes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, rare; for ſo this word is uſed elſewhere, Eſa. 13.12. <hi>I will make a man more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then fine gold:</hi> and ſo it is explained here in the following clauſe, <hi>The word of the Lord was precious in thoſe dayes, there was no open viſion:</hi> That is, there was not a known Prophet in thoſe dayes, there was not a man openly known, to whom the Lord appeared in viſions, as afterwards he did to his Prophets, or whom the Lord did ſend forth among the people with a word of prophecie in his mouth. Now this is thus expreſſed, partly to ſhew how the Lord hereby puniſhed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe of theſe times: many of the Prieſts were grown in theſe dayes deſperately wicked, and by their means the worſhip of God grew into contempt; (for men abhorred the offerings of the Lord, chap. 2.17.) and ſo by degrees, idolatrie and all other ſinnes grew rife amongſt them; as is evident by the reformation following immediately after this, when Samuel came to be their Judge, chap. 7.3, 4. Now hereupon, as theſe words implie, the Lord hid himſelf in a great meaſure from his people, and did not reveal his will by his Prophets to them as at other times, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which is threatned, Amos 8.11. <hi>I will ſend a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord:</hi> and that complaint of the Church, Pſal. 74.9. <hi>We ſee not our ſignes, there is no more any Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. and then again it is expreſſed partly for the honour of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, by and in whom the Lord was pleaſed to reeſtabliſh in his Church this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall office; whence it is, that often in the Scripture Samuel is mentioned as the firſt of the Prophets, as 2. Chron. 35.18. <hi>And there was no Paſſeover like to that, kept in Iſrael from the dayes of Samuel the Prophet:</hi> and Acts 3.24. <hi>Yea and all the Prophets from Samuel and thoſe that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewiſe foretold of theſe dayes;</hi> and ſo alſo Heb. 11.32.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And it came to paſſe at that time when Eli was laid down in his place,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the time is ſet down when the Lord appeared firſt to Samuel: firſt, more generally, that it was in thoſe dayes when the word of the Lord was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſo rare; for to this in the words immediately foregoing, I conceive this clauſe may beſt be referred, <hi>And it came to paſſe at that time;</hi> though indeed others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to that which is related in the foregoing chapter, verſ. 27. concerning a meſſage that was brought unto Eli by a man of God that was ſent unto him, to wit, that <hi>at that time,</hi> when the aforeſaid Prophet had ſpoke unto Eli, then alſo the Lord appeared to Samuel, and told him of the judgements that ſhould fall upon Eli and his houſe: and then, ſecondly, more particularly; as firſt, that it was in the night, <hi>when Eli was laid down in his place,</hi> that is, when he was gone to bed,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42229:121"/>
and laid down to his reſt, to wit, in ſome lodging of the houſe, wherein the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was kept; of which ſee the note before, chap. 19. and ſecondly, that it was towards morning, verſ. 3. <hi>ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the Ark of God was;</hi> that is, before the lamps that were in the golden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick in the Tabernacle were gone out, the oyl being waſted: (for in the evening the lamps were lighted, and ſo burnt all night till they went out in the morning: concerning which ſee the note Exod. 30.7. whence it is ſaid, 2. Chron. 13.11. that the lamps of the golden candleſtick were <hi>to burn every evening</hi>) as for that clauſe verſ. 2. concerning the dimneſſe of Elies eyes, <hi>when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not ſee;</hi> that is inſerted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to implie alſo the time when the Lord appeared to Samuel; namely, that it was when Eli was now grown very old, inſomuch that he began to be blind with age; or elſe rather to implie beforehand the reaſon why Samuel, ſuppoſing that Eli had called him, when the Lord ſpake to him, was ſo ready even in the night time to run to him; namely, becauſe Eli could not ſee, and therefore often wanted help, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof Samuel, who now in his young years attended upon Eli, was wont to riſe and go to him if he heard him call, though it were at midnight.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he was not yet acquainted with Gods manner of revealing himſelf to his Prophets by viſions.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.]</hi> By this we may perceive the reaſon why the Lord ſuffered Samuel ſo often to miſtake the voice that he heard, and run to Eli, to wit, that Eli might certainly be aſſured when he heard Gods meſſage from him, that indeed the Lord had appeared to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the Lord came, and ſtood, and called,</hi> &amp;c.] This proves not that God appeared in a viſible ſhape; rather it is a ſpeech of God after the manner of men, yet happely withall to implie, either that whereas before the voice he heard was as of one afarre off, now it was as of one that ſtood near by him; or elſe that whereas before the Lord onely called him, now he did not onely call him, but alſo proceeded to make known what he had to ſay to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Behold, I will do a thing in Iſrael, at which both the eares of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle.]</hi> That is, at the hearing whereof they ſhall be ſtricken with horrour and aſtoniſhment. The ſame expreſſion is uſed 2. Kings 21.12. in threatning the evil that was to come upon Jeruſalem and Judah, becauſe of the ſinnes of Manaſſeh; and it is a figurative expreſſion taken from the ſinging and dizzineſſe which ſome ſudden terrible noiſe, as a clap of thunder, or the roring of a cannon, will make in the head of a man that is near to it. How this was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in Eli, and the wife of Phinehas, we may reade in the following chapter, verſ. 18, 19, &amp;c. where we ſhall find, that upon the report of the judgement now threatned, Eli fell down and brake his neck, and his daughter in law the wife of Phinehas fell preſenty into the pains of travell and died.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>When I begin I will alſo make an end.]</hi> That is, as ſure as I begin, ſo ſure will I make an end; though it may be ſome time ere I begin, yet aſſuredly all ſhall come upon them which I have threatned.</p>

was not ignorantly done, but wittingly: he knew what his ſonnes did, and that the Lord was diſpleaſed at it (for he had by his meſſenger, chap. 2.27. threatned him for it) and yet he would not reſtrain them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe his ſonnes made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.]</hi> The word here tranſlated <hi>vile,</hi> may be alſo rendered <hi>accurſed,</hi> as it is in the margin of our bibles; and indeed let the word be taken either way, the ſonnes of Eli had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this cenſure; <hi>vile,</hi> they were in regard of their baſe ſinnes, which made them even to ſtink, and to be abhorred amongſt the people; every one loathed them for their abominable lives: and <hi>accurſed</hi> they were in regard of the curſe of God, that is in a ſpeciall manner denounced againſt thoſe, that preſumptuouſly walk in ſuch groſſe and deteſtable ſinnes; and it might well be ſaid, that they <hi>made themſelves vile,</hi> or <hi>accurſed,</hi> becauſe it was merely by their own wilfull chooſing to walk in ſuch lewd wayes, that they had brought ſuch ſhame upon themſelves, and expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the curſe of God according to that of the Prophet, <hi>O Iſrael, thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>I have ſworn unto the houſe of Eli<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the iniquitie of Elies houſe ſhall not be purged with ſacrifice, nor offering for ever.]</hi> Two things are included in this decree of the Lord, concerning Elies houſe: firſt, concerning his wicked ſonnes, that the Lord delivering them up to a reprobate ſenſe, they ſhould continue in their infidelity, impenitency, and hardneſſe of heart, unto their dying day, and ſo then it was not their ſacrifices and offerings that ſhould do them any good: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, concerning their poſterity, that the temporall puniſhment which God had threatned to bring upon them, ſhould not by any means be kept off, to wit, that the dignity of the high prieſts office, ſhould be taken from them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Samuel lay untill the morning, and opened the doores of the houſe of the Lord.]</hi> By this and ſome other places it ſeems probable, that though the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle whilſt it was in the deſert, for the better tranſporting and carrying it from place to place, had no other covering nor fence, then the curtains and hangings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Moſes, yet afterwards it was ſome other way ſhut in; yea as it is moſt probable houſed; whence there is mention here of the doores of the houſe of the Lord, ſee the notes chap. 1.9. The office of opening the doores belonged to the Levites, as afterward in the Temple, 1. Chron. 23.5. and ſo Samuel now did it. And obſervable indeed it is, that Samuel was not puffed up ſo by the Lords appearing to him, as to deſpiſe that which might ſeem for a Prophet a mean im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Samuel feared to ſhew Eli the viſion.]</hi> Though the Lord had not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Samuel to acquaint Eli with that he had revealed to him, concerning the heavy judgement that ſhould befall his houſe, yet his own reaſon ſuggeſted, that it was not fit that a ſecret that ſo nearly concerned him, ſhould be kept from him; onely ſaith the text, Samuel <hi>feared to ſhew Eli the viſion,</hi> to wit, either becauſe, firſt, ſuch ſad tydings he knew would wound his heart, and therefore being loth to grieve him, he was afraid to let him know it; or ſecondly, becauſe he doubted it might ſeem arrogancy in him, as a meſſenger ſent from God, to denounce ſuch terrible things againſt his aged Tutour and governour; or thirdly, becauſe he feared Elies diſpleaſure, as knowing well that ancient men, and men in authority, cannot eaſily
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42229:122"/>
brook, to have the judgement of God denounced againſt them, eſpecially by thoſe that are for years, or otherwiſe, inferiour to them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>God do ſo to thee and more alſo, if thou hide any thing from me,</hi> &amp;c.] By this importunity of Eli in conjuring Samuel ſo earneſtly to tell him all that God had ſaid unto him, it is evident that ſo ſoon as Eli conceived that the Lord had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Samuel, he preſently feared that ſomething was revealed to him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him and his ſonnes. Guilty conſciences will ſtill be ſuggeſting terrours and fears upon every occaſion; and ſo it was here with Eli; being conſcious to himſelf of his ſonnes lewdneſſe, and his own indulgence towards them, no ſooner was he perſwaded in his mind, that the Lord had appeared in a viſion to Samuel, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he apprehended ſome heavy ſentence pronounced againſt him; and this made him now ſo eager to know what it was; as for this manner of adjuration, <hi>God do ſo to thee and more alſo,</hi> ſee the note, Ruth. 1.17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18: <hi>And he ſaid, It is the Lord: let him do what ſeemeth him good.]</hi> God hath abſolute power over all his creatures, to do with them what ſeemeth good in his own eyes, neither is he to render an account of his actions: and beſides, he is moſt wiſe, and faithfull, and juſt, ſo that though men cannot comprehend the reaſon of his judgements, yet they may be ſure there can be nothing faulty in them: and to his children withall his goodneſſe and love is ſo great, that unleſſe it were needfull he would not, and beyond what is needfull he will not afflict them. In all which regards it might well be, that Eli alledged this as a reaſon why he could not but ſubmit to what was threatned; namely, becauſe it was the Lord that had ſaid it. <hi>It is the Lord: let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And all Iſrael, even from Dan to Beerſheba, knew that Samuel was establiſhed to be a Prophet of the Lord.]</hi> To wit, by the accompliſhment, not onely of that which he had now ſaid unto Eli, but alſo of other things revealed to him by the Lord at other times; in regard whereof that is added which follows in the next verſe, <hi>the Lord appeared again in Shiloh,,</hi> to wit, to Samuel.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>For the Lord revealed himſelf to Samuel in Shiloh, by the word of the Lord.]</hi> That is, by Chriſt, the word of his Father, or by revealing his will and word unto him, which afterwards was to be delivered by him to others, to wit, by propheticall revelation, and not by any corporall or viſible apparition.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the word of Samuel came to all Iſrael.]</hi> Or, <hi>came to paſſe;</hi> the meaning is, that Samuel as a Prophet made known the word of the Lord, as to Eli before, ſo afterwards to all Iſrael, reproving them for their ſinnes, and telling them beforehand the judgements that would fall upon them, if they did not repent. All which did accordingly come upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now Iſrael went againſt the Philiſtines to battel,</hi> &amp;c.] Who began now again to invade the land of Iſrael. It may ſeem that all the fourtie years of Elies judging Iſrael they had been quiet; happely becauſe they had been ſo exceedingly weakned by the ſlaughter which Samſon made ſo often among them, eſpecially at his death; where no doubt moſt of their princes and lords were ſlain, Judg. 16.30. <hi>And Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid, Let me die with the Philiſtines; and he bowed himſelf with all his might:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42229:122"/>
and the houſe fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein: ſo the dead which he ſlew at his death, were mo then they which he ſlew in his life.</hi> But now they began again to quarrell with the Iſraelites, and that no doubt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſecret counſell of God, who intended to puniſh hereby both the Prieſts and people of Iſrael; and hereupon it was, that the Philiſtines being entred upon the land of Iſrael, the Iſraelites were gathered together to fight with them; now the camp of the Iſraelites was beſides Eben-ezer, that is, a place where afterward a ſtone was erected that was called Eben-ezer, the occaſion whereof we may ſee chap. 7.11, 12. and the camp of the Philiſtines was in Aphek, a citie in the tribe of Judah, which bordered upon the land of the Philiſtines: ſee Joſh. 15.53.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Wherefore hath the Lord ſmitten us to day before the Philiſtines? Let us fetch the Ark,</hi> &amp;c.] Though idolatrie and many other groſſe ſinnes were at this time rife amongſt the Iſraelites; <hi>They provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealouſie with their graven images,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt concerning theſe very times, Pſal. 78.58. yet ſo blind and ſtupid they were, that becauſe they were the ſeed of Abraham, and the people of God, they wondered why God ſhould take the uncircumciſed Philiſtines part againſt them, never minding or mentioning their own wickedneſſe, which had provoked the Lord to bring theſe miſeries upon them; <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſay they, <hi>hath the Lord ſmitten us to day before the Philiſtines?</hi> and vainly they thought to mend all for the future, by fetching the Ark of God to be amongſt them: <hi>Let us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>fetch the Ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that when it cometh among us, it may ſave us out of the hand of our enemies.</hi> Now however they were moved no doubt to take this courſe: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ark was the ſigne of Gods preſence amongſt them; whence it is ſaid verſ. 4. that <hi>the people ſent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the Ark of the covenant of the Lord of hoſts, which dwelleth between the Cherubims:</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe the Iſraelites in former times had prevailed mightily againſt their enemies, when the Ark was amongſt them, as when they vanquiſhed the Midianites, Num. 31.6. and at the ſacking of Jericho, when the walls of the citie fell down before them, Joſh. 6.4, 5. and on the other ſide, when the Ark was not with them, they had gone by the worſt, as when they went out to fight againſt the Canaanites, Num. 14.44, 45. <hi>They preſumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheles the Ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moſes departed not out of the camp. Then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and ſmote them, and diſcomfited them even to Hormah:</hi> and therefore it ſeems afterwards to have been an uſuall cuſtome to carrie forth the Ark into the field with them; for Saul had it with him when he was in arms againſt the Philiſtines, chap. 14.18. <hi>Saul ſaid unto Ahiah, Bring hither the Ark of God (for the Ark of God was at that time with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael):</hi> and Joab (as ſome think) had it with him when he went out againſt the Ammonites, <hi>the Ark, and Iſrael, and Judah abide in tents,</hi> ſaid Uriab, 2. Sam. 11.11. yet becauſe at preſent they did merely reſt upon the outward ſigne, and did not repent them of their ſinnes, whereby they had forfeited their intereſt in God, nor ſeek to make their peace with God, as they ought to have done; therefore their confidence in the Ark was groundleſſe and vain, and the ſigne of Gods preſence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ineffectuall amongſt them. And doubtleſſe there was a ſecret overruling hand
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42229:123"/>
of God in this their ſudden reſolution to fetch the Ark into the camp, whereby he made way to the delivering up the Ark into the power of the enemie, and to the death of the two ſonnes of Eli, who coming along with the Ark, were ſlain by the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the two ſonnes of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were there with the Ark of the covenant of God.]</hi> To wit, either to carrie it, as Num. 4.15. or at leaſt to attend it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And the Philiſtines were afraid; for they ſaid, God is come into the camp.]</hi> This happely the Philiſtines ſpake, as thinking the Ark to be ſome repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the God of the Iſraelites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having the ſame opinion of it as they had of their own idols; at leaſt they conceived that there was ſome divine power that went along with the Ark where it went, which was the reaſon why they were ſtricken with ſuch aſtoniſhment and fear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they ſaid, Wo unto us; for there hath not been ſuch a thing heretofore.]</hi> That is, in former conflicts we have had with them, they uſed not to bring their Ark into the camp; even by this unwonted ſhout of the Iſraelites we may ſee how much greater their hope and confidence is now, then it hath been formerly.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Theſe are the Gods that ſmote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderneſſe.]</hi> In the former part of this clauſe it is manifeſt, that the Philiſtines ſpeak of thoſe divers great plagues wherewith the Lord ſmote both Pharaoh and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Egypt, thereby forcing them to let his people go; but theſe words <hi>(in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe)</hi> are added in the cloſe, becauſe in the overthrow of the Egyptians in the red ſea (which joyned to the deſert of Etham, Exod. 13.20.) there was a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all the former plagues.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>For his heart trembled for the Ark of God.]</hi> Which proceeded partly from the guiltineſſe of his conſcience, and the remembrance of thoſe heavie things which had been ſpoken to him; firſt by the man of God, chap. 2.27. and then by Samuel, chap. 3.18. and partly from the great care be took above all for the Ark, leſt that ſhould fall into the hands of the uncircumciſed Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Now Eli was ninetie and eight years old, and his eyes were dim that he could not ſee.]</hi> His age is mentioned as the cauſe of his blindneſſe; his blindneſſe as the cauſe why he took no notice of this dolefull meſſenger till he perceived ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what was amiſſe by the crie of the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And it came to paſſe when he made mention of the Ark of God, that he fell from off the ſeat.]</hi> This implies, firſt, the ſuddenneſſe of his death; no ſooner did the meſſenger make mention of the Ark, but preſently his heart died within him, and ſo falling down backward he brake his neck: and ſecondly, how grievous it was to him to heare the Ark was taken; though he was able to endure the relation of the flight and ſlaughter of the people, yea, of the death of his two ſonnes, yet as ſoon as he began the relation of the arks being taken, that preſently ſtruck him into a deadly ſwo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n. As for the gate from the ſeat whereof he fell, either it was the gate of the city, or of the Tabernacle; and if the laſt be meant, very obſervable it is, that in the place where his ſonnes had ſo grievouſly ſinned, chap. 2.22. this heavy hand of God ſhould fall upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For he was an old man, and heavy.]</hi> Both his weakneſſe through age, and the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42229:123"/>
corpulency and unwieldneſſe of his body were the cauſe, that falling he brake his neck; and therefore are they here expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>When ſhe heard the tydings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, ſhe bowed her ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] As women are wont to do when the pains of travell come upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>But ſhe anſwered not, neither did ſhe regard it.]</hi> That is, ſhe made no anſwer to that wherewith they ſought to comfort her, as indeed not regarding it, but rather proceeded on in expreſſing her ſorrow by giving that name <hi>Ichabod,</hi> that is, <hi>Where is the glorie,</hi> or <hi>there is no glorie,</hi> to her ſonne that was born.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>The glorie is departed from Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c,] God was the glorie of his people becauſe rejecting other nations, he had choſen them to be his peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal. 106.20. <hi>Thus they changed their glorie into the ſimilitude of an oxe that eateth graſſe:</hi> Jer. 2.11. <hi>Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory, for that which doth not profit:</hi> and therefore ſhe ſaith, that the glorie was departed from Iſrael, becauſe they had loſt the ark which was the ſigne of Gods preſence amongſt them, and conſequently their glorie; Pſal. 26.8. <hi>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth:</hi> and Pſal. 78.60, 61. <hi>So that he forſook the Tabernacle of Shiloh: the tent which he placed among men, and delivered his strength into captivitie: and his glorie into the enemies hands.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>WHen the Philiſtines took the ark of God, they brought it into the houſe of Dagon, and ſet it by Dagon.]</hi> This they did either in contempt of the ark, preſenting it as a captive before their Dagon, by whoſe help they perſwaded themſelves it was, that they had overcome both the Hebrews and their God; or elſe out of a kind of reverence they bare to this God of the Hebrews, whom therefore they thought good to place with Dagon in his Temple. Whence alſo perhaps it was, that they feared to offer any violence to it, by opening it and taking forth thoſe holy things that were in it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord.]</hi> And hereby did the Lord diſcover to the Philiſtines what a vain idol their Dagon was, and that the God of Iſrael was the onely true almightie God; yea the more the Lord was magnified herein, becauſe he caſt down this idol-god in his own temple, enemies being never foyled with more glorie to the conquerour then when they are overcome in their own dominions. Beſides, the ark being a type of Chriſt, by whom God reveales his will unto men in the miniſterie of the Goſpel, the fall of Dagon before the ark, did notably ſhadow forth the ruine of idolatrie, by the preaching of the Goſpel; God will not ſuffer any rivall-gods to ſtand cheek by jowl with him, but when the Goſpel comes in, idolatrie ſhall down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they took Dagon and ſet him in his place again.]</hi> Had Dagon fallen but once, being at firſt daſhed in pieces, they might have pretended that it came by ſome caſualtie; but now when upon the firſt fall they ſet it up again, and no doubt uſed all the skill they could to faſten it; this made it beyond all excuſe manifeſt, that by the mightie power of God onely it was beaten down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:42229:124"/>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threſhold,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>The head,</hi> the ſeat of wiſedome, <hi>and the hands,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſtrength of man is put forth <hi>were cut off,</hi> to ſhew that there was neither knowledge nor power in this their idol-god. Beſides, now the prieſts could not ſet up their idol again, and conceal his overthrow from the people, as before perhaps they did. By caſting the head and hands upon the threſhold, that thoſe that entred might preſently trample upon them, the Lord ſhewed the baſeneſſe of this their idol-god; or that he would have this ſpectacle ſcarre them from coming any more into that Temple for that groſſe idolatry, whereto they had formerly given themſelves. As for that laſt clauſe, <hi>onely the stump of Dagon was left to him,</hi> in the Originall it is <hi>onely Dagon remained,</hi> the ground whereof may be, becauſe the moſt of the idol that remained, was the fiſhie part. For <hi>Dag</hi> ſignifieth a fiſh; now becauſe this idol was ſo called, in regard that in the nether parts it reſembled a fiſh, the hands and head being cut off, it is ſaid that onely Dagon remained: ſee the note. Judges 16.23.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagons houſe, tread on the threſhold,</hi> &amp;c.] This they did either by way of veneration, as accounting the threſhold ſanctified by the touch of the head and hands of their idol; or rather by way of deteſtation, as thinking that it was the falling of their idol up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the threſhold, that had daſhed it in pieces (for why elſe ſhould they not as well have forborn to tread upon the pavement, where the body of their idol lay?) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thus by the alruling Providence of God, even their ſuperſtition, became a means to perpetuate the memorie of this wonderfull work of God in the confuſion of their idol, which otherwiſe within ſome ſhort time, might have been forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Aſhdod, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed them, and ſmote them with emerods.]</hi> Becauſe that the Lord had ſo clearly diſcovered to the men of Aſhdod, that their Dagon was a vain idol, and that the God of Iſrael, whoſe ark they had boldly ſurprized, was the onely true almighty God, to wit, by caſting down their idol before the Ark, and at laſt breaking it in pieces; and yet notwithſtanding they continued ſtill as ſuperſtitiouſly devoted to their idol, as they were before, and were not afraid ſtill to detain the ark of God in captivity, as at the firſt: therefore now the Lord began to take vengeance on the men of Aſhdod, <hi>the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the men of Aſhdod.</hi> &amp;c. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Expoſitours underſtand the next words, <hi>and he destroyed them,</hi> of the plague of mice, wherewith alſo that this time he deſtroyed and waſted their land, chap. 6.5. and others of ſome other mortall diſeaſe, which God ſent amongſt them, beſides the emerods: but I rather conceive, that all the following words are meant of the plague of the emerods, wherewith God ſmote them, <hi>and he deſtroyed them, and ſmote them with emerods;</hi> onely theſe words, <hi>and he deſtroyed them,</hi> are prefixed to make known, that this diſeaſe of the emerods was amongſt them not onely painfull and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull, Pſal. 78.66. <hi>And he ſmote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetuall ſhame;</hi> but mortall alſo, ſo that many died of them, and therefore the Ekronites cried out, verſ. 10. <hi>They have brought about the Ark of the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to us, to ſlay us and our people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And they anſwered, Let the Ark of the God of Iſrael, be carried about unto Gath.]</hi> This the Lords of the Philiſtines reſolved upon, to try hereby whether

it were the preſence of the ark that had cauſed thoſe plagues; or whether they came by chance; with which conceit as yet they chuckered themſelves; elſe the Princes of Gath, who were in this counſell amongſt the other Lords of the Philiſtines, would never have conſented to the removing of the Ark to their city.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Send away the Ark of the God of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] The men of Ekron being fully now convinced, that it was becauſe of the Ark, that ſo much miſery was fallen on them; deſire plainly, that it might be ſent back to the land of Iſrael: but it ſeems their Princes, loth yet to part with ſuch a glorious trophee of their victory; deſired to try yet a little further; for that after this it was ſent both to Gaza and Aſhkelon, is evident: chap. 6. verſ. 4. <hi>Then ſaid they, What ſhall be the treſpaſſe-offering which we ſhall return to him? They anſwered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your Lords:</hi> and again verſ. 17. <hi>And theſe are the golden emerods which the Philiſtines returned for a treſpaſſe-offering unto the Lord; for Aſhdod one, for Gaza one, for Aſhkelon one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the men that died not, were ſmitten with the emerods.]</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this may be, that there were many ſmitten with the emerods, beſides thoſe that died of them; or elſe we muſt hold that there was ſome other deadly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which God ſent amongſt them beſides the emerods, which is called in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe, <hi>a deadly destruction.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>ANd the Philiſtines called for the prieſts and the diviners, ſaying, What ſhall we do to the Ark of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus was God the more glorified, when their very prieſts, the moſt zealous maintainers of their idol-gods, were brought to give this following advice, which tended ſo much to the honour of the Lord, and the ſhame of their idols. The queſtion they propounded to their prieſts was not, <hi>What ſhall we do with the Ark?</hi> but <hi>What ſhall we do to the Ark of the Lord? Tell us wherewith we ſhall ſend it to his place,</hi> that is, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with what gifts ſhall we ſend back the Ark? Being convinced by the heavy hand of God that lay upon them, that they had treſpaſſed ſome way againſt the Ark; it ſeems their reaſon led them to think, that ſome ſatisfaction or other was to be made; and thereupon, being reſolved to ſend it away, they conſulted wherewith they ſhould ſend back the Ark,</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Then ye ſhall be healed, and it ſhall be known to you, why his hand is not removed from you.]</hi> That is, if they were healed, as they confidently aſſured themſelves it would prove, then hereby they ſhould know why hetherto his hand had not been removed from them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>They anſwered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philiſtines.]</hi> Theſe were the treſpaſſe-offerings which their prieſts and diviners adviſed them to ſend back with the Ark, to wit, as by way of acknowledgement, that the God of Iſrael had brought upon them thoſe plagues of the emerods, and mice, for their holding of the Ark of God captive amongſt them; and therefore the reaſon given in the following verſe, why they would have theſe preſents ſent back with the Ark, is that they might hereby give glory to the God of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42229:125"/>
Iſrael, namely, by an acknowledgement and confeſſion of their ſinne, and the juſt hand of God that had been upon them for their ſinne: verſ. 5. <hi>Ye ſhall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice, that marre the land, and ye ſhall give glory unto the God of Iſrael;</hi> the very ſame expreſſion which Joſhua uſed when he adviſed Achan to confeſſe his fault, Joſh. 7.19. <hi>My ſonne,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> It may well be indeed which ſome conceive, that the ſending of ſuch abſurd and ridiculous gifts with the Ark, as emerods and mice, was ſuggeſted by Sathan to their diviners in contempt of God: but if it were ſo, whilſt Sathan intended hereby to diſhonour God, the Lord by his alruling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, intended hereby to caſt the ſhame upon them, and to bring great glory to his own name; whilſt the Philiſtines themſelves, were made to ſend into the land of Iſrael ſuch things, as might there remain perpetuall monuments and memorialls of thoſe ſhamefull puniſhments, wherewith God had humbled them. It cannot well be conceived how they could make images of their emerods, without making images of their ſecret parts, where they were ſmitten with thoſe ulcers, which we call piles or emerods. Now what a ſhame muſt it needs be to the Philiſtines to ſend to the Iſraelites the images of their ſecret parts, thus tortured with an ignominious diſeaſe? Doubtleſſe they muſt needs judge it a great reproch to their nation; but when men are under the wrath of the Almighty, what will they not do to be rid of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that lie upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods.]</hi> From this paſſage ſome Expoſitours gather that not Dagon onely, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of their idol-gods were thrown down and broken to pieces, by a ſecret hand of God, in all the cities whither the Ark was brought, as indeed it is probable the like was done in Egypt, when the Lord puniſhed Pharaoh and his people becauſe they would not let the Iſraelites go. <hi>Against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute judgement,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Exod. 12.12. and Num. 33.4. it is ſaid, <hi>The Egyptians buried all their firſt-born—; upon their gods alſo the Lord executed judgements.</hi> But yet becauſe this is not expreſſed in the ſtory, others underſtand this which is ſaid here, of the hand of the Lord which was upon their gods, onely of the reproch and diſhonour, that was brought upon their idols, partly by the Lords caſting down Dagon, and partly by the heavy judgements he had infflicted upon the people that ſerved them; and that this hand of God it was, which the Philiſtine-prieſts hoped would be lightned from off their gods, if the Ark were ſent back with thoſe treſpaſſe-offerings they had now preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardned their hearts,</hi> &amp;c.] By this it may ſeem. that though the greateſt number enclined to the ſending of the Ark back, verſ, 2. <hi>What ſhall we do,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to the Ark of the Lord, Tell us wherewith we ſhall ſend it to his place;</hi> yet ſome were of a contrary judgement, and oppoſed it, and therefore are here blamed for hardning their hearts againſt the means which God had uſed to convince them of their ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch-kine, on which then hath come no yoke,</hi> &amp;c.] It may well be, that theſe idolatrous prieſts and diviners of the Philiſtines, did not merely of their own invention preſcribe this ſtrange way of ſending home the Ark, to make tryall whether the God of Iſrael, would by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42229:125"/>
power, cauſe theſe milch-kine to go the right way with it; but were herein directed to do what they did by their practices of ſorcerie and divination: but if it were ſo, even herein too there was an over-ruling hand of providence, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all as might be moſt for Gods glorie. A new cart was doubtleſſe appointed as a ſigne of their reverencing the Ark: their chooſing young heifers that had never been employed in any profane ſervice, might alſo be done for the ſame cauſe out of reverence to the Ark; but the main end was to make the hand of God the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, if they ſhould go along the right way to the land of Iſrael. Cuſtome might make cattel uſed to the yoke to go on right forward, when they are once entred into a beaten way; but young things not uſed to the yoke, eſpecially when their calves were ſhut up from them, were not like to do ſo; it was a wonder that they ſhould endure the yoke at all.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a treſpaſſe-offering in a coffer,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe <hi>jewels of gold</hi> were the golden images of the emerods and mice; which they put <hi>in a coffer,</hi> as not daring to venture it ſeems, to put them into the Ark.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And ſee, if it goeth up by the way of his own coaſt to Bethſhemeſh.]</hi> A citie of Judah, Joſh. 15.10. cloſe by the confines of Judea and Philiſtea, and in the way to Shiloh; and therefore propounded here by the Philiſtines Prieſts, as the citie whither the kine would go if Gods hand were in the buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the kine took the ſtraight way to the way of Bethſhemeſh,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus did the Lord by his all-ruling power and providence, proſper the device which they had contrived to diſcover whether it was by him, and for their detaining the Ark, that they had been of late ſo ſeverely puniſhed, that he might confound them by their own inventions. Bethſhemeſh was one of the Prieſts cities, Joſh. 21.16. ſo that the kines carrying the Ark thither, was as if they had intended to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it up into their hands to whom the cuſtodie of it did of right appertain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the lords of the Philiſtines went after them unto the border of Bethſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſh.]</hi> Thus by the providence of God it was brought about, that they who ere-while as victours did carrie away the Ark as their captive, do now as ſervants and pages attend upon it, when it returned home into the land of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And they of Bethſhemeſh were reaping their wheat-harveſt.]</hi> Wheat-harveſt in that countrey uſed to be in our May, at the feaſt of Pentecoſt, Lev. 23.16. Whence we may gather, that the Ark was taken about November, ſince it was verſ. 1. ſeven moneths in the countrey of the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt-offering unto the Lord.]</hi> That this is ſpoken of the men of Bethſhemeſh, and not as ſome would have it, of the Lords of the Philiſtines, that came after the Ark to ſee what would become of it, is evident by the very connexion of the words: In the foregoing verſe it is ſaid, that <hi>they of Bethſhemeſh were reaping,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they lifted up their eyes, and ſaw the Ark, and rejoyced to ſee it;</hi> and in this verſe now it follows; <hi>And they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine, a burnt-offering to the Lord.</hi> Beſides, when the men of Bethſhemeſh came flocking about the Ark, and the Levites had taken down the Ark out of the cart, as it followeth in the next verſe; is there any likelihood that they would ſuffer the uncircumciſed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42229:126"/>
to come amongſt them to offer up a ſacrifice to the God of Iſrael, they ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, and as it were communicating with them in their ſacrifice? Surely no; rather we may well think that the lords of the Philiſtines followed the Ark aloof off, onely deſiring to ſee what would become of it, and came not near the Iſraelites; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid verſ. 16. that <hi>when the five lords of the Philiſtines had ſeen it;</hi> that is, when they had ſeen what was done, <hi>they returned to Ekron the ſame day.</hi> The greateſt difficultie is concerning the offering up of kine, which we know was not according to Gods Law, and therefore liker to be the act of the Philiſtines, then of the Prieſts of Iſrael; for the Law did expreſſely command that none but males ſhould be offered in burnt-offerings: Levit. 1.3. <hi>If his offering be a burnt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemiſh.</hi> But to this it may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that either the men of Bethſhemeſh did ſinne herein, being tranſported by the exceſſe of their joy: and that this might be one thing wherewith they diſpleaſed God, and provoked him to bring the following judgement upon them: or rather that this was an extraordinary act of devotion whereto the Prieſts were led, by reaſons grounded upon this ſtrange and extraordinary work which God had wrought, and perhaps alſo by a ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods Spirit; and is not therefore to be judged of according to the rules of other ordinary burnt offerings: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that theſe kine had been given up by the Philiſtines to the ſervice of the Lord in bringing home the Ark; and that having been employed in ſo ſacred of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it was not fit they ſhould be imployed to any other uſe; or much leſſe that they ſhould be ſent back to the Philiſtines again; and therefore they reſolved by this way of an extraordinary burnt-offering to yield them up to the Lord, by whoſe all-ruling providence they were ſo miraculouſly ſwayed to bring back the Ark unto that place. And indeed had they ſinned in offering theſe kine for a burnt-offering, why ſhould not this be mentioned verſ. 19. as the cauſe of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them, as well as their looking into the Ark.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the Levites took down the Ark of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Prieſts who were of the tribe of Levi: for Bethſhemeſh as is before noted, was one of the Prieſts cities, Joſh. 21.16. nor was it lawfull for the Levites to touch the Ark: Num. 4.15. <hi>And when Aaron and his ſonnes have made an end of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Sanctuarie, and all the veſſels of the Sanctuarie, as the camp is to ſet forward; after that, the ſonnes of Kohath ſhall come to bear it; but they ſhall not touch any holy thing leſt they die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philiſtines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of countrey villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, according as all the cities and villages of the Philiſtines were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five parts, and were under the command of their five great lords, each of thoſe cities before mentioned being the mother citie in each diviſion; ſo accordingly there were five golden mice given (as was ſaid before, verſ. 4.) and that in the name (and happely at the charge) not of the mother-cities onely, but of all the ſeverall circuits or provinces that belonged to them, becauſe all had been puniſhed with that plague of mice which were ſent amongſt them; even all the land of the Philiſtines <hi>unto the great ſtone of Abel;</hi> that is, <hi>mourning;</hi> ſo called doubtleſſe, becauſe of the peoples lamentation (verſ. 19.) as upon a like occaſion the floore of Atad where
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42229:126"/>
the ſonnes of Jacob with the Egyptians mourned for the death of Jacob, was called <hi>Abel-mizraim,</hi> Gen. 50.11. that is, <hi>the mourning of the Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And he ſmote the men of Bethſhemeſh, becauſe they had looked into the Ark of the Lord.]</hi> It was not lawfull for any but the Prieſts, no not the Levites who carried it, to look upon the Ark bare and uncovered: Num. 4.20. <hi>But they ſhall not go in to ſee when the holy things are covered, lest they die.</hi> It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficient to render the people obnoxious to the judgement that fell upon them, if we ſuppoſe that it came covered from the Philiſtines, and they uncovered it to look upon it; or that it came uncovered, and they took libertie without any fear or reverence to ſtare and gaze upon it: But yet the words ſeem to import that they proceeded further, even to look into the Ark; either merely out of curioſitie, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſee whether the Philiſtines had not put any thing into it, or taken any thing out of it; onely I ſee not how ſo many could offend in this kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even he ſmote of the people fiftie thouſand, and threeſcore and ten men.]</hi> That is, of them, and of the people together that came flocking from all parts to ſee the Ark, there were ſlain <hi>fiftie thouſand, and threeſcore and ten men.</hi> It were much that there ſhould be ſo many found in ſo little a citie as Bethſhemeſh was; but amongſt thoſe multitudes that might come from all parts to ſee the Ark, there might well be fiftie thouſand, and threeſcore and ten ſlain.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And they ſent meſſengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim,</hi> &amp;c.] Pretending happely that their citie of Bethſhemeſh was not a place of ſuch ſafetie for the Ark to be in, as Kirjath-jearim was; they ſent to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim to deſire them to fetch the Ark thither: <hi>The Philiſtines,</hi> ſay they, <hi>have brought again the Ark of the Lord, come ye down, and fetch it up to you.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the men of Kirjath-jearim came and fetcht up the Ark of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Three particulars are here related concerning this remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of the Ark. The firſt is, that it was fetcht up from Bethſhemeſh by the men of Kirjath-jearim, a citie in the tribe of Judah, not farre from Bethſhemeſh, called formerly Baalah, and Kirjath-Baal, Joſh. 15.9, 60. and 18.14. Now this being none of the cities of the Prieſts who onely might touch the Ark; though it be ſaid, that <hi>the men of Kirjath-jearim fetcht up the Ark,</hi> yet thereby is meant onely, that they came up to have it carried to their citie, and attended it when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved (for they were doubtleſſe prieſts either of Bethſhemeſh, or of ſome other place that carried the Ark.) Notwithſtanding the men of Bethſhemeſh were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for looking into the Ark, chap. 6.19. yet the men of Kirjath-jearim did not oppoſe the removing of it to their citie, but themſelves fetched it thither, no doubt with much joy, and that becauſe they knew that it was not the preſence of the Ark amongſt the men of Bethſhemeſh, but their unreverend carriage of themſelves in gazing upon the Ark, or looking into it, that was the cauſe of their miſerie. The ſecond thing related is, that they brought the Ark <hi>into the houſe of Abinadab in the hill.</hi> It is likely that Abinadab was a man of ſingular holineſſe; and perhaps, as ſome hold, a Levite too; but yet the reaſon which the text implies, why his houſe was choſen for the keeping of this ſacred treaſure, is this; that it was <hi>in the hill,</hi> to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42229:127"/>
wit, firſt, becauſe high places were in theſe times in great requeſt, and judged fitteſt for holy employments: and ſecondly, becauſe it might be a place of ſtrength, and ſo of ſafetie for the Ark to be kept in: whence it was, that the Ark was kept there till Davids time, when it was fetched away from thence: 1. Chron. 13.6, 7. <hi>And David went up and all Iſrael to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the Ark of God the Lord.— And they carried the Ark of God in a new cart out of the houſe of Abinadab.</hi> Indeed in 2. Sam. 6.3. it is ſaid that the Ark was brought <hi>out of the houſe of Abinadab that was in Gibeah:</hi> but by Gibeah there is meant <hi>the hill,</hi> (as it is tranſlated there in the margin of our Bibles) for it is expreſſely ſaid in that very place, verſ. 2. that the city out of which the Ark was then fetched was Baal of Judah, which was Kirjath-jearim, as is before noted, Joſh. 15.9. and the city Gibeah was in the tribe of Benjamin, Joſh. 18.28. Judg. 19.14. The third particular here related is, that having carried the Ark into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe of Abinadab in the hill, they <hi>ſanctified Eleazar his ſonne to keep the Ark of the Lord,</hi> that is, they choſe him to be ſet apart to this holy imployment, even to give continuall attendance upon the Ark, that he might keep others from coming near to pollute or defile it; and to that end they cauſed him to fit and prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all holy manner for this ſacred charge; under which the waſhing of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with water, and ſuch other ceremonies of legall purifying, may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, as we ſee Exod. 19.10. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Go unto the people and ſanctifie them to day and to morrow, and let them waſh their clothes.</hi> But may ſome ſay, when the Iſraelites had gotten the Ark again out of the land of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, why did they not carry it back to the Tabernacle in Shiloh? I anſwer, at firſt the terrour of the men of Bethſhemeſh, might be the cauſe that it was preſently removed to Kirjath-jearim, a city near unto Bethſhemeſh; yet becauſe the Ark ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there ſo long, it is moſt probable, that either it was at firſt removed thither, or at leaſt afterward continued there, not without the conſent of Samuel their Judge, and the other Elders of Iſrael; yea happely not without expreſſe direction from the Lord, and that becauſe Shiloh was deſtroyed when the Ark was taken by the Philiſtines; or elſe, rather becauſe the Lord would ſtill ſhew his indignation againſt the former wickedneſſe of that place, by not ſuffering the Ark to be carried thither again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And it came to paſſe while the Ark abode in Kirjath-jearim; that the time was long; for it was twenty years,</hi> &amp;c.] This is not meant of the whole term of the Arks remaining in Kirjath-jearim; for between the death of Eli (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after which the Ark was brought to this place) and the beginning of Davids reigne when it was firſt removed thence, 2. Sam. 6.2, 3. there muſt needs be four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years allowed for the government of Saul and Samuel, Act. 13.21. all which time the Ark continued in Kirjath-jearim, unleſſe when it was for a while onely carried forth into the camp in the warre againſt the Philiſtines, chap. 14.18. <hi>And Saul ſaid unto Ahiah, Bring hither the Ark of God: for the Ark of God was at that time with the children of Iſrael.</hi> The meaning therefore of this clauſe, is onely thus, that twenty years were expired ere the people by the exhortations of Samuel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by the troubles that God brought upon them, could be wonne to that ſolemne converſion related in the following verſes, concerning which it is ſaid here in the laſt clauſe of this verſe, that <hi>all the houſe of Iſrael lamented after the Lord,</hi> that is,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42229:127"/>
they were brought to bethink themſelves of their ſinnes, and began with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and ſorrow to ſeek the recovery of Gods love and favour, and that no doubt becauſe of the heavy oppreſſion of the Philiſtines: for it ſeems that ever ſince the taking of the Ark, they had kept many of Iſraels cities in their hands, and many wayes tyrannized over them, as is evident verſ. 7. <hi>The Lords of the Philiſtines went up againſt Iſrael: and when the children of Iſrael heard it, they were afraid of the Philiſtines.</hi> And verſ. 14. <hi>The cities which the Philiſtines had taken from Iſrael, were reſtored to Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3, <hi>And Samuel ſpake unto all the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, to the Elders of Iſrael reſorting to him from all places; or to the people, as he went about in his circuit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Put away the ſtrange gods, and Aſhtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and ſerve him onely.]</hi> That is, Content not your ſelves with the outward act of removing your ſtrange gods, but labour to bring your hearts into a fit temper for God, purified by faith, humbled with the ſight and deteſtation of your ſinnes, and ſettled in a full purpoſe of amendment of life. Concerning Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroth, ſee the Note, Judges 2.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And Samuel ſaid, Gather all Iſrael to Mizpeh and I will pray for you unto the Lord.]</hi> Of Mizpeh, ſee Judges 20.1. Thither the people are at preſent appointed to gather themſelves. 1. That they might there in a publick and ſolemn manner renew their Covenant with God, and pray unto him for pardon and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: and 2. That they might there conſult about means, both for reforming of publick abuſes, and for making warre againſt the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day,</hi> &amp;c.] What this pouring forth of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the Lord was, and to what end it was done, it is hard to ſay. Many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours underſtand it merely of drawing and pouring forth water, to wit, as a kind of ſacrifice; or rather, as a ſacred Ceremony, whereby they deſired to ſignifie either, Firſt, That they wiſhed that thoſe that ſhould return to their idolatry again, might utterly periſh without hope of recovery, as that water that was poured forth, that could not be gathered up again, according to that of the widdow of Tekoah, 2. Sam. 14.14. <hi>We muſt needs die, and are as water ſpilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered up again:</hi> or Secondly, That they did utterly renounce and caſt away their idolatry, even as that water was wholly poured forth out of their veſſels, not the leaſt drop remaining behind, and were reſolved never more to take up their ſuperſtitious practiſes again, no more then they would think of taking up that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again which they had ſo poured forth: or Thirdly, That they hoped that as the water being poured forth was ſtreight gone out of ſight, and was not to be ſeen, ſo the very remembrance of their ſinnes ſhould be blotted out before the Lord, &amp; ſhould be as it were perfectly waſhed away: or Fourthly, That in their confeſſions and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that day, they did ſincerely poure out their hearts to God; even as that water was poured forth. Thus I ſay many Expoſitours underſtand this to have been done according to the letter of the words, and that it is ſaid to be done <hi>before the Lord,</hi> becauſe it was done where they were met together in a way of religion, to faſt and pray before the Lord, and where happely they had for the time the Ark of God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42229:128"/>
amongſt them. But yet becauſe we find no ſuch ceremony any where enjoyned by Gods Law, nor at any other time practiſed by Gods people: others do, I think upon better grounds conceive otherwiſe of theſe words. For ſome hold, that it is a figurative and hyperbolicall expreſſion of their great lamentation and weeping, to wit, that they poured forth whole ſtreams of tears before the Lord, drawn from the inward fountain of a broken heart and ſo paralell it with thoſe expreſſions of Jeremy, Jer. 9.1. <hi>Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears! that I might weep day and night,</hi> &amp;c. of Job, Job 16.20. <hi>Mine eye poureth out tears unto God;</hi> and ſo alſo of David, Pſal. 6.6. <hi>All the night make I my bed ſwimme; I water my couch with tears:</hi> and Pſal. 42.3. <hi>My tears have been my meat day and night.</hi> And again, others conceive that it is meant of their drawing and pouring forth water for the uſe of their legall purifying, which was frequently uſed in thoſe times as a ſigne that they acknowledged their own filthineſſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be cleanſed by the bloud and ſpirit of Chriſt. And indeed this laſt, beſt agreeth with the letter of the Text.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And Samuel took a ſucking lambe, and offered it for a burnt-offering,</hi> &amp;c.] If Samuel offered this himſelf, and not by the hands of the prieſts, it was by extraordinary diſpenſation in regard he was a prophet; for ſo we ſee alſo Elijah did, 1. Kings 18.31, &amp;c. The like we muſt judge alſo concerning the place wherein this ſacrifice was offered, at leaſt if the Ark were not at preſent in Mizpeh.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>But the Lord thundred with a great thunder on that day upon the Philiſtines.]</hi> This was according to Hannahs prophecy, chap. 2.10. But yet the Iſraelites were fighting, not idly looking on, when the Lord thundred upon them, as is evident in the next clauſe, <hi>and they were ſmitten before Iſrael.</hi> No doubt in the beſt manner they were able, they ſet themſelves in battel array againſt the Philiſtines, yea and when the Philiſtines were diſcomfited, it ſeems the reſt that ſtaid in Mizpeh came out too, as ſeems to be expreſſed in the following verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Then Samuel took a ſtone, and ſet it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſhews that this glorious victory was gotten in the very ſame place, where before the ark was taken and the Iſraelites van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, chap. 4. verſe 1. <hi>Now Iſrael went out againſt the Philiſtines to battel, and pitched beſide Eben-ezer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>So the Philiſtines were ſubdued, and they came no more into the coaſt of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] It may be queſtioned how theſe words muſt be underſtood that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines <hi>came no more into the coaſt of Iſrael,</hi> and that firſt, Becauſe it is evident that the Philiſtines did often after this invade the land of Iſrael; as is clear, chap. 17.1. and 31.1. &amp; many other places. Yea, and ſecondly, It was not long after this ere they did enter the land and that with a mighty army. For in the beginning of Sauls reign, chap. 13.1, 5. which was not long after this, <hi>the Philiſtines gathered themſelves together to fight with Iſrael, thirty thouſand charets, and ſix thouſand horſemen, and people as the ſand which is on the ſea-ſhore in multitude, and they came and pitched in Michmaſh,</hi> &amp;c. and thirdly, The very following words here, <hi>and the hand of the Lord was againſt the Philiſtines all the dayes of Samuel,</hi> ſeem clearly to imply, that after this even in Samuels dayes, there were many conflicts between the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines and the Iſraelites, wherein the Iſraelites ſtill prevailed againſt them. But for the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42229:128"/>
reſolving of this doubt we muſt know, that the meaning of theſe words, <hi>And they came no more into the coaſt of Iſrael,</hi> is, that they did no more at that time rally their ſcattered troops together, and come back again into the land of Iſrael, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their former defeat; or elſe, that they came no more into the land whilſt Samuel governed Iſrael alone; and indeed this is the utmoſt extent that can be given to theſe words: for after Saul was choſen to be their King, it is evident that the Philiſtines did often with their armies enter the land.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the cities which the Philiſtines had taken from Iſrael, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to Iſrael, from Ekron even unto Gath,</hi> &amp;c.] It is plain by many places, that in the beginning of Sauls reigne, the Philiſtines had garriſons in ſeverall places of the land of Iſrael; for ſo we reade, chap. 10.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt come to the hill of God,</hi> ſaith Samuel to Saul when he had newly anointed him King, <hi>where is the garriſon of the Philistines:</hi> and again chap. 13.3. <hi>Jonathan ſmote the garriſon of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines that was in Geba,</hi> and the like in other places: either therefore the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines did again after this ſurpriſe ſome ſtrong forts, which they had now delivered up, and did again place garriſons there; or elſe, though they now reſtored to Iſrael the cities they had formerly taken from them, yet they ſtill reſerved ſome places of ſtrength wherein they kept garriſons, for the better awing of the Iſraelites, that they might not break out againſt the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there was peace between Iſrael and the Amorites.]</hi> That is, there was no warre between them. By the Amorites here ſome conceive the Philiſtines are meant: but it may alſo be meant of the remainder of the Canaanites, who being terrified with this victory which the Iſraelites had gotten over the Philiſtines, did hereupon alſo deſiſt from troubling the Iſraelites: for this is here ſet down as an effect of that victory.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Samuel judged Iſrael all the dayes of his life.]</hi> For though Saul were anointed King in Samuels time, and had the ſupreme power in his hand, yet Samuel gave not over the government altogether, but exerciſed the juriſdiction of a Judge, or a kind of extraordinary power derived unto him from God, as appears by many things he did after Saul was King, as his killing of Agag, chap. 15.32, 33. <hi>Then ſaid Samuel, Bring you hither to me Agag the King of the Amalekites: and Agag came unto him delicately: And Agag ſaid, Surely the bitternes of death is paſt. And Samuel ſaid, As thy ſword hath made women childleſſe, ſo ſhall thy mother be childles among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.</hi> And his anointing of David, chap. 16.13. <hi>Then Samuel took the horn of oyle, &amp; anointed him in the midſt of his brethren:</hi> and therefore are Saul &amp; Samuel joyned together, chap. 11.7. <hi>And he took a yoke of oxen, &amp; hewed them in pieces, and ſent throughout all the coasts of Iſrael by the hands of meſſengers, ſaying, Whoſoever cometh not forth after Saul, and after Samuel, ſo ſhall it be done unto his oxen.</hi> And the years of both their government are joyned together, Act. 13.20, 21. <hi>And after that he gave unto them Judges, about the ſpace of foure hundred and fifty years, untill Samuel the prophet. And afterward they deſired a king, and God gave unto them Saul the ſonne of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of fourty years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And there he built an altar unto the Lord.]</hi> This he might do by an extraordinary Propheticall inſtinct, eſpecially in theſe times when it is very que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd it came to paſſe when Samuel was old, that he made his ſonnes judges over Iſrael.]</hi> To wit, as his deputies and ſubſtitutes, being through age unable to go through the land to judge the people, as formerly he had done, he appointed his ſonnes to judge the people in ſome part of the land in his ſtead, and that happely not without Gods permiſſion and conſent.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Now the name of his firſt-born was Joel.]</hi> Who was alſo called Vaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, 1 Chron. 6.28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They were judges in Beerſheba.]</hi> Though they exerciſed authority, and power of Judges over all the people, at leaſt in thoſe parts, and went happely in their circuits as their father had done; yet there they dwelt, as their father did in Ramah, and there moſt an end they judged the people: and that it may be purpoſely, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that town was in the utmoſt ſouthpart of the land, the furtheſt off from Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, from whence it was moſt trouble for the people to come to Samuel in Ramah; or becauſe it bordered cloſe upon the land of the Philiſtines, over whom they might the better keep a vigilant eye.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And his ſonnes walked not in his wayes, but turned aſide after lucre.]</hi> Not onely the ſingular piety of Samuel, but alſo the experience he had of Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt Eli for his indulgence to his children, may well induce us to think that he did what he could to train up his ſonnes in the wayes of righteouſneſſe, nor can we indeed think that he would have entruſted them with the ſubordinate power of governing the people under him, had they not to that time behaved themſelves well, and given hope of managing the truſt well that was committed to them; but being advanced to theſe places of dignity and power, it ſeems they ſoon degenerated, and proved the occaſion of much miſchief to the commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Behold, thou art old, and thy ſonnes walk not in thy wayes: now make us a King,</hi> &amp;c.] They expreſſely pretend onely Samuels age, and his ſonnes wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, as the reaſons why they deſired a King; but there were other things that did chiefly move them in this attempt; to wit, firſt, their fear of the great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they perceived Nahaſh the king of the children of Ammon made againſt them; whereupon as men not having any confidence in Gods protection, they fly to other devices, and pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ch upon this of making them a king chap. 12.12. <hi>And when ye ſaw that Nahaſh the king of the children of Ammon came againſt you, ye ſaid unto me, Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a king ſhall reigne over us;</hi> and ſecondly, an ambitious affectation of being like other nations; by turning their government into an abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which is implyed in their laſt words, <hi>Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</hi> But though they were reſolved to have a king, yet they referre the choice of him that ſhould reigne over them to the Lord (for they came to Samuel as a Prophet that might enquire in this buſineſſe of God) and that no doubt as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſpect to that which was written in their Law; Deut. 17.14, 15. <hi>When th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>But the thing displeaſed Samuel,</hi> &amp;c.] It could not but greive him, that the people, of whom he had deſerved ſo well, ſhould thus unthankfully ſhake off his government; but the cheif thing that troubled him, was becauſe he knew their deſire was ſinfull, and would be diſpleaſing to God: and therefore that clauſe is added, that <hi>Samuel prayed unto the Lord,</hi> that is, he prayed him to forgive this their ſinne, to help in this danger, and to direct him what courſe he ſhould take with them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they ſay unto thee.]</hi> Thus God yields to their deſire, but in his anger, Hoſea 13.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reigne over them.]</hi> That is, For they have rejected me rather then thee: we have the like phraſe in many places of Scripture, as Matth. 10.20. <hi>For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the ſpirit of your father which ſpeaketh in you:</hi> It is the ſpirit of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rather then you that ſpeaks: Hoſ. 6.6. <hi>For I deſired mercie and not ſacrifice;</hi> that is, mercie rather then ſacrifice: Acts 5.4. <hi>Thou haſt not lied unto men, but unto God;</hi> that is, unto God rather then men. And this God ſaith, firſt, becauſe they caſt off that government which God had eſtabliſhed amongſt them: for though God had a purpoſe to erect a regall throne amongſt them, and to give them Kings out of whoſe ſeed the Meſſiah ſhould come; and now made uſe of their inordinate deſire to accompliſh his own purpoſe: (as uſually he doth turn the evil actions of men to a good end) yea though he had partly made known this to his people; Gen. 17.6. <hi>And I will make thee exceeding fruitfull, and I will make nations of thee, and kings ſhall come out of thee;</hi> and 49.10. <hi>The ſceptre ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between his feet, untill Shiloh come:</hi> Deut. 17.18. <hi>And it ſhall be, when he ſitteth upon the throne of his kingdome, that he ſhall write him a copie of this law in a book:</hi> yet they ſhould have waited Gods leiſure; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it therefore lawfull to make an innovation in the government, without any direction from the Lord; eſpecially in ſuch a ſinfull manner, out of a diſtruſtfull fear, and proud affectation to be therein like all other nations; as is noted before upon Deut. 17.14. ſecondly, becauſe though God do govern by kings alſo, Prov. 8.15, 16. <hi>By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree justice, By me Princes rule, and Nobles; even all the Judges of the earth:</hi> yet his government was more immediate which he now exerciſed over them by Judges; both becauſe they were extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily raiſed up of God, and becauſe they had not that abſolute power which kings uſually have, but judge them chiefly by making known to them the will of God; and to that end did often enquire of the Lord in difficult caſes: ſee Judg. 8.23. And thus the Lord ſhews Samuel, firſt, the grievouſneſſe of their ſinne, and that this moved him in his diſpleaſure to yield them their deſire: and ſecondly, he ſought to prevent the wonder and indignation of Samuel; for why? they dealt no otherwiſe with him, then with the Lord himſelf; as Chriſt ſaith to his diſciples, Matt. 10.24, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>He will take your ſonnes, and appoint them for himſelf, for his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> &amp;c.] That princes may make uſe of the ſubjects that live under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand both in the ſervices of warre and peace, cannot be queſtioned; nor yet that the ſubjects may be legally compelled to yield obedience in this kind if they ſhould refuſe; but the oppreſſion which is here threatned is, that he ſhould deal with them herein, as tyrants with ſlaves, not freeborn ſubjects, forcing children from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents many times, without affording them any equall recompence; and that to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them cauſeleſſely, onely to ſatisfie his pleaſure in the baſeſt drudgerie and moſt perillous employments. And how ſoon the Iſraelites began to feel theſe grievances under their kings, we may ſee by that which is ſaid of Solomon, 1. Kings 12.4. <hi>Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous ſervice of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will ſerve thee.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Samuel ſaid unto the men of Iſrael, Go ye every man unto his citie.]</hi> That is, he undertook to ſatisfie their deſire, and ſo brake up the aſſembly, till the Lord had revealed his will; and ſo it might be known what courſe they ſhould take to provide them a king.</p>

Kings 14.2. and perhaps the Lord did herein ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them oftentimes, that he might keep them from ſeeking to witches, or to the oracles of the heathens: 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Behold, he is before you; make haſte now, for he came to day to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.]</hi> The citie they ſpeak of was Ramah, where Samuel dwelt, as is evident by the ſervants words, verſ. 6. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, Behold now there is in this citie a man of God, and he is an honourable man,</hi> &amp;c. how then do theſe young maidens ſay, <hi>He came to day to the citie?</hi> I anſwer: either they intend onely his going forth out of his houſe into the citie; or elſe, that he was come out of that Ramah, where his dwelling was, into this where the feaſt was to be kept (for here were two towns joyned in one; whence it is called in the duall number Ramathaim, chap. 1.1.) or elſe, that having been abroad about ſome employments, he was this day returned to Ramah.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For there is a ſacrifice of the people to day in the high place.]</hi> To wit, a ſacrifice of peace-offerings, wherewith the offerers were wont to feaſt together with their friends: and it may be Samuel had purpoſely appointed this ſacrifice for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the man that was to be anointed king; and for the procuring of Gods favour in that great and weightie buſineſſe: for it is evident, verſ. 15, 16. that God had the day before told Samuel, that he would this day ſend him a man out of the land of Benjamin, whom he ſhould anoint Captain over his people Iſrael. But what was this high place where they offered their ſacrifices? were not the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites bound by the law onely to offer up ſacrifices on the altar that was in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle? Deut. 12.4, 5. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the place which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation ſhall ye ſeek, and thither thou ſhalt come; And thither ye ſhall bring your burnt-offerings and your ſacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, Many Expoſitours hold, that this was meant onely of the Temple; and that till the Temple was built, the people might lawfully offer their ſacrifices in any other places: but yet, firſt, becauſe Jer. 7.12. Shiloh is called the place where God ſet his name at the firſt: and ſecondly, becauſe it was to no end to have an altar in the Tabernacle, if the people might ſet up altars and offer ſacrifices where they liſted themſelves: and thirdly, becauſe in the beginning of Solomons reigne before the Temple was built, it is mentioned as the onely blemiſh of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites in thoſe flouriſhing times, 1. Kings, 3.2. <hi>Onely the people ſacrificed in high places;</hi> therefore many other Expoſitours hold, that even before the Temple was built, the people uſed to bring their ſacrifices to the Tabernacle, as afterwards to the Temple till the Ark was taken by the Philiſtines in the dayes of Eli; but that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Tabernacle and Ark being ſtill kept in ſeverall places, the people began to queſtion whether they were then tied to bring their ſacrifices to any of thoſe places; and ſo by degrees did at length offer their ſacrifices in ſuch places as they judged meeteſt for ſuch ſervices, to wit, upon hills and clifts, which were therefore called high places.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Now the Lord had told Samuel in his eare, a day before Saul came,</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:42229:131"/>
&amp;c.] Before the ſtory relates the meeting of Samuel and Saul, this is here inſerted, <hi>that the day before Saul came, the Lord had told Samuel in his eare,</hi> that is, by the ſecret inſtinct of his ſpirit, that the next day he would ſend him a man out of the land of Benjamin, whom he ſhould anoint to be king of Iſrael; firſt, to intimate that this was the occaſion of the ſacrifice and feaſt which Samuel had appointed, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the man choſen of God to be their king was to come thither this day, he had appointed this feaſt for his entertainment; and ſecondly, to ſhew that it was no wonder that Samuel ſhould preſently entertain Saul as the elect king of Iſrael, becauſe the Lord having told Samuel the day before, that he would ſend him a man out of Benjamin the next day, when this came to paſſe as God had told him, this muſt needs be a notable means to ſtrengthen Samuels faith.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And thou ſhalt anoint him to be captain over my people Iſrael, that he may ſave my people out of the hand of the Philiſtines.]</hi> It ſeems the Philiſtines, who had been quiet all Samuels time, chap. 7.13. <hi>So the Philistines were ſubdued, and they came no more into the coaſt of Iſrael: and the hand of the Lord was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Philistines all the dayes of Samuel;</hi> began now again to raiſe warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iſraelites, having happely made an agreement to that purpoſe with the king of Ammon, that the one ſhould invade the land on one hand, and the other on the other ſide: for that the Ammonites did alſo invade the land at this time, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent chap. 12.12. <hi>And when ye ſaw that Nahaſh the king of the children of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon came against you, ye ſaid unto me, Nay, but a king ſhall reigne over us; when the Lord your God was your king.</hi> This made the people cry, and their cry the Lord heard, and taking pitty on them, promiſed now to ſave them from the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, (of whom it ſeems they were moſt afraid) and that by the hand of Saul. And indeed, though the warre betwixt Saul and the Philiſtines continued all his dayes, and at his death they prevailed much, yet oftentimes he prevailed againſt them, and ſo ſaved them from much of that oppreſſion which otherwiſe the Philiſtines would have laid upon them: wherein alſo obſervable it is, that God intended mercy to them in that, which they notwithſtanding had ſinned in deſiring, to wit, the raiſing up of a king amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Go up before me unto the high place, for ye ſhall eat with me to day; and to morrow I will let thee go, and tell thee all that is in thine heart.]</hi> Though Samuel knew that Sauls ſoveraignty would deprive him of that ſupreme dignity he had formerly enjoyed, yet knowing it was Gods will that Saul ſhould be king, we ſee that inſtead of looking with an envious and malignant eye upon him, he entertained him with all poſſible courteſie, and did what he could to honour him amongſt the people. As for that clauſe, <hi>And will tell thee all that is in thine heart,</hi> thereby is meant, either that he would tell him all that he had a purpoſe to enquire of him, or elſe he would tell him many ſecret things which no body knew but himſelf onely; and indeed, though for the preſent he told him of the aſſes onely, as it follows in the next verſe, <hi>And as for thine aſſes that were loſt three dayes ago, ſet not thy mind on them, for they are found,</hi> (which doubtleſſe he did, to free him from that care, and that he might be the more willing to ſtay with him) yet it may well be that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when they were together alone, he told him many other ſecret things, for the greater confirmation of his faith, concerning the promiſe of the kingdome, as
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42229:132"/>
Chriſt did to the woman of Samaria, to make her know he was the Meſſiah. Joh. 4.29. where we have an expreſſion much like this of Samuel, <hi>Come ſee a man,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>that hath told me all that ever I did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And on whom is all the deſire of Iſrael? is it not on thee, and on all thy fathers houſe?]</hi> That is, on whom muſt the kingdome and royall dignity, which all Iſrael deſire may be reared up amongſt them, be conferred but on thee and on thy fathers houſe?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And Saul anſwered and ſaid, Am not I a Benjamite, of the ſmalleſt of the tribes of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Samuel had in the foregoing words ſpoken very covertly, concerning Sauls being king, <hi>And on whom is all the deſire of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. yet the peoples eagerneſſe at this time to have a king being ſo famouſly known, Saul might well hereby gueſſe at Samuels meaning, and the ſtrangeneſſe of ſuch ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings makes him therefore as one aſtoniſhed, ſo debaſe himſelf, <hi>Am not I a Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, of the ſmalleſt of the tribes of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. Nor need we wonder that he calls the tribe of Benjamin, <hi>the ſmalleſt of the tribes,</hi> if we remember that this tribe was almoſt wholly deſtroyed not many years before, in that warre that was between this tribe and their brethren of the other tribes, Judg. 20. Long it was, it ſeems, ere this tribe recovered the deſolation that was then made amongſt them, if ever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it; for even in regard that there were ſo few of this tribe, it may well be, that when this tribe kept faithfull to the houſe of David in the dayes of Jeroboam, as well as the tribe of Judah, yet ſtill the Scripture ſpeaks but of one tribe that did cleave to the houſe of David, to wit, the tribe of Judah, as we may ſee, 1. kings 11.32. and ſo in many other places; Benjamin not being mentioned becauſe of their pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but comprehended under the men of Judah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Samuel took Saul, and his ſervant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them ſit in the cheifeſt place among them that were bidden.]</hi> Doubtleſſe thoſe invited were of the Elders and cheif of the city: by placing Saul therefore above them, he began to give a ſigne of the dignity he ſhould be raiſed too; and withall, ſhewed how farre he was from envying him, becauſe he ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by his advancement.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And Samuel ſaid unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I ſaid unto thee, Set it by thee.]</hi> Samuel it ſeems had given order to the cook, for one ſpeciall extraordinary meſſe that ſhould be ſet by &amp; reſerved, as for ſome extraordinary gueſt, and not ſent up till Samuel ſent for it: and hereupon therefore he now called upon him to bring him that meſſe, that it might be ſet before Saul. As for the cuſtome of thoſe times in allotting a ſeverall meſſe to every gueſt, ſee the note upon Gen. 43.34.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the cook took up the ſhoulder, and that which was upon it, and ſet it before Saul.]</hi> To wit, the left ſhoulder; for the right ſhoulder of all peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was the prieſts portion, Levit. 7.32, 33. The ſhoulder was it ſeems in theſe times accounted the cheif peice, and therefore doubtleſſe was it alloted for the prieſts portion, and here at this time appointed for Sauls meſſe. It is hard to ſay what is meant by thoſe words, <hi>and that which was upon it,</hi> to wit, whether it be meant of any thing that was poured or laid upon it as ſauce, or onely for garniſhing the meat, or of any other joynt that was here brought in, together with the ſhoulder, as
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42229:132"/>
the neck or breaſt which before they are ſevered are upon the ſhoulder; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſhoulder is the onely joynt mentioned, the firſt I conceive is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold, that which is left, ſet it before thee, and eat; for unto this time hath it been kept for thee, ſince I ſaid, I have invited the people.]</hi> That is, ſince I firſt gave order to the cook that he ſhould prepare this proviſion for thoſe that were invited. Now this is expreſſed, that hereby Saul might ſee that God had beforehand revealed his coming thither to Samuel; for how elſe could Samuel have purpoſely ſet apart this portion for him?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the houſe.]</hi> Where they might be moſt private; for thence alſo is that, Acts 10.9. <hi>Peter went up upon the houſe to pray, about the ſixth houre.</hi> Both this, and his chooſing the ſpring of the day to anoint Saul in, verſ. 26. before any bodie was ſtirring; and his going forth to the end of the citie, and ſending his ſervant away, verſ. 27. they all ſhew how carefull Samuel was, that it ſhould not yet be known that Saul was anointed king, to wit, that when he was afterward choſen by lot, no body as yet thinking of any ſuch thing, it might be the more manifeſt that he was choſen of God, and that no body elſe had any hand in it: and ſecondly, that Saul might hereby be taught to wait upon God, to content himſelf with the promiſe for a time, and to ſtay Gods leiſure for the performance of what was promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And Saul aroſe, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.]</hi> The calling up Saul therefore to the top of the houſe mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words, <hi>Samuel called Saul to the top of the houſe,</hi> &amp;c. was onely that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel might will him to make ready preſently to be gone; which Saul accordingly did; and ſo then Samuel went along with him out of the citie, intending at their parting to anoint him king.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen Samuel took a viall of oyl, and poured it upon his head, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him,</hi> &amp;c.] Two ceremonies are here mentioned which Samuel uſed, when he conferred upon Saul the ſupreme power of being king of Iſrael. The firſt is, <hi>that he took a viall of oyl, and poured it upon his head;</hi> which he did by Gods command; as we find it expreſſed chap. 15.1. <hi>Samuel alſo ſaid unto Saul, The Lord ſent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Iſrael:</hi> and this was doubtleſſe to ſignifie, firſt, that the Lord had choſen him and ſet him apart to that ſacred and ſupreme office of being Gods Vicegerent, in ruling and governing his people; for oyl being ordinarily uſed in the conſecrations of the Old Teſtament; by the anointing of the kings of Iſrael, the Lord was pleaſed to ſhew forth, that he had called them and ſeparated them to this place of ſingular and higheſt authoritie over the people; and the rather ſay ſome Expoſitours, beauſe oyl being mingled with other liquours will be ſtill uppermoſt; and ſo was the fitter to ſhadow forth that eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of dignitie and power whereto God had advanced them; and ſecondly, that the Lord would poure forth upon him an extraordinary meaſure of the gifts of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, figured by the oyl, thereby to enable him for that great ſervice whereto he was called: whence it is noted in the ninth verſe of this chapter; to ſhew as it were,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42229:133"/>
the accompliſhment of that which was ſignified by this outward ceremony, that <hi>God gave him another heart,</hi> and verſ. 6. that he was <hi>turned into another man,</hi> he was not the ſame man that he was before. Beſides, becauſe by that ſpeech of Jothams, Judg. 9.8. <hi>The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them,</hi> it is evident that it had been many years before this, a conſtant cuſtome amongſt other nations to anoint their kings, and ſo was alwayes continued: whence it is that Cyrus the king of Perſia is called the Lords anointed, Eſa. 45.1. it may well be that the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a king like other nations, the Lord might in this regard appoint this their new choſen king to be deſigned to his ſoveraignty by the ſame ceremony that was uſed amongſt other nations. It is a great queſtion amongſt Expoſitours whether the kings of Iſrael were anointed with that holy anointing oyl of the Tabernacle, wherewith the Preiſts were anointed, or with any other ordinary oyl; but becauſe there is nothing can be alledged that gives the leaſt intimation, that Saul was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed with the oyle of the Sanctuary, but onely that David and his ſucceſſours were, I ſhall referre the reſolving of this doubt to the note upon chap. 16.1. The ſecond ceremony uſed here by Samuel at the anointing of Saul was, that he <hi>kiſſed him:</hi> which he did either by way of congratulation for that dignitie whereto God had now advanced him, as making this a token of Gods favour, and his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and peaceable reſigning the government over to him; or rather by way of homage; for in thoſe times, it ſeems, ſubjects uſed to acknowledge the ſovereignty of their kings by kiſſing them, whence is that expreſſion concerning Chriſt, of whom it is ſaid there, that God had <hi>ſet him to be king upon his holy hill of Sion,</hi> Pſal. 2.11, 12. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear — Kiſſe the ſonne leſt he be angry:</hi> and the ground of this civill ceremony was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſignifie the willingneſſe of their ſubjection, that they loved their kings, and not ſo much out of fear as love would be ready to ſerve them. And thence it well may be too that in times of idolatry they uſed to kiſſe their idols, as is evident, 1. King. 19.18. <hi>Yet I have left me ſeven thouſand in Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kiſſed him:</hi> and again, Hoſ. 13.2. <hi>And now they ſinne more and more, and have made them molte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>And ſaid, Is it not becauſe the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance?]</hi> In rendring this reaſon why he had uſed thoſe outward ceremonies, the Prophet chiefly preſſeth him to remember, firſt, that it was not he but the Lord that had choſen him to be king: and ſecondly, that it was Gods own inheritance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whom he was to reigne; a ſtrong argument to render him the more carefull how he ruled over them: 1. Kings 3.9. <hi>Give therefore thy ſervant an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart to judge thy people, that I may diſcern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy ſo great people?</hi> Why the Iſraelites were called the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, ſee the note Deut. 32.9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt find two men by Rachels ſepulchre in the border of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.]</hi> Though Bethlehem was in the portion of Judah, Mich 5.2. <hi>But thou Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be a ruler in Iſrael:</hi> and Rachels ſepulchre in the way to Bethlehem; Gen. 35.19, 20. <hi>And Rachel dyed, and was buried in the

way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob ſet a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachels grave unto this day.</hi> yet might her ſepulchre be in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Benjamin, or near to it: for the portion of theſe two tribes lay together.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And there ſhall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying three kids,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe they were going thither to ſacrifice: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that as in many other places, ſo in Bethel alſo there was an high place at this time, wherein they uſed to ſacrifice: to which they might partly be induced out of an opinion of the holyneſſe of the place, becauſe there God appeared to Jacob, Gen. 28.19. Now the more punctually theſe particulars are here expreſſed which theſe men carried with them, the more it muſt needs ſtrengthen Sauls faith, when the leaſt thing failed not of that which was now foretold him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And they will ſalute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou ſhalt receive of their hands.]</hi> It is moſt probable that theſe men did never formerly know Saul, nor were at all acquainted with him, becauſe Samuel gives him order to take the loaves which they ſhould proffer him, which there would have been no need to have done, had they been his known and familiar freinds; now the leſſe reaſon could be conceived why mere ſtrangers ſhould carry themſelves thus towards him, the more admirable it was that God ſhould ſecretly move their hearts thus to honour him, as it were with a preſent, as if they had known of the advancement which the Lord had conferred upon him; and the more admirable and ſtrange this was which Samuel foretold, the more it muſt needs confirm Sauls faith when it came to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>After that thou ſhalt come to the hill of God, where is the garriſon of the Philiſtines.]</hi> Concerning the garriſons which the Philiſtines kept now in the land of Iſrael ſee the note chap. 7.14. It is probable that this was in Gibeah of Benjamin where Sauls father dwelt, or near to it: firſt, becauſe this happened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his journey, where his uncle dwelt, and where himſelf was well known, as is evident verſ. 11. <hi>And it came to paſſe when all that knew him before time, ſaw that behold he prophecyed among the Prophets, then the people ſaid one to another, What is this that is come unto the ſonne of Kiſh?

Chron. 25.1, 2, 3. <hi>Moreover, David and the captains of the hoſt ſeparated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſonnes of Aſaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who ſhould propheſie with harps, with pſalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſervice, was: Of the ſons of Aſaph, Zaccur, and Joſeph, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniah, and Azarelah: the ſonnes of Aſaph, under the hands of Aſaph, which propheſied according to the order of the king.

Cor. 11.4. <hi>Every man praying, or prophecying, having his head covered, diſhonoureth his head.</hi> And ſuch doubtleſſe were theſe prophets. It appears by this and other places, that there were in theſe times certain Colledges erected, wherein many holy men lived conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God; whoſe continuall employment it was to ſtudie the Law, and other holy writings, to teach and inſtruct others therein; to ſing in a ſolemne manner Pſalmes of praiſe unto the Lord; and to train up other young ſtudents who ſtudied this way of prophecying under them. One of theſe there was at Bethel, another at Jericho: 2. Kings 2.3.5. Yea, ſo did the Lord bleſſe this courſe, that upon many of them he beſtowed that extraordinary gift of foretelling future things, as is evident by that place before-cited, 2. Kings 2.3. <hi>And the ſons of the Prophets that were at Bethel, came forth to Eliſha, and ſaid unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy Maſter from thy head to day? And he ſaid, yea, I know it, hold you your peace.</hi> And ſo verſ. 5. where the ſame is ſaid of the ſonnes of the Prophets that were at Jericho. Such a Colledge there was here; and of theſe were the Prophets that met Saul; whence it is ſaid, that they had <hi>a pſalterie, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp before them:</hi> for theſe they made uſe of in their ſinging and praiſing God; and if that were not all that was intended, when they are ſaid to have propheſied, we may conceive that this muſick was uſed to ſtirre up their own hearts, and the hearts of the people before they propheſied; as Eliſha did, 2. Kings 3.15. <hi>But now bring me a minſtrell. And it came to paſſe when the minſtrell played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.</hi> Concerning this their prophecying, ſee the note upon Numb. 11.25.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt propheſie with them, and ſhalt be turned into another man.]</hi> That is, he ſhould become a man of a more princely and heroicall ſpirit then now he was, and filled with new and divine gifts and qualities; and ſo thoſe whom God advanceth to be ſpiritually Kings and Prieſts, Rev. 1.6. <hi>And hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and his Father: to whom be glorie and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</hi> he makes them new men, 2. Cor. 5.17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are past away, behold, all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.</hi>

                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:42229:134"/>Verſ. 7. <hi>Do as occaſion ſhall ſerve thee, for God is with thee.]</hi> That is, as any occaſion or opportunitie ſhall be given of doing any thing that belongs to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dignity whereunto God hath now advanced thee, fear not to undertake it, for God who hath called thee to this honour, is with thee to proſper thee in it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And thou ſhalt go down before me to Gilgal, and behold I will come down unto thee to offer burnt-offerings,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe words Samuel appoints Saul, 1. to go down to Gilgal, promiſing that he would come thither to him, to offer up ſacrifices for him, and to direct him what he ſhould do: &amp; 2. to ſtay there for him ſeven dayes, as it is in the laſt words of this verſe, <hi>ſeven dayes ſhalt thou tarry till I come to thee, &amp; ſhew thee what thou ſhalt do:</hi> and the joyning of this to that which went before, may ſeem to import that he enjoyned Saul to do this immediately upon the accompliſhment of the ſignes before mentioned; whereas indeed it is evident in the 13. chapter, that it was two years after Sauls being anointed by Samuel, ere Saul waited for Samuel at Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and was ſharply reproved becauſe he did not wait fully to the end of the ſeventh day, as Samuel had enjoyned him; for ſo we reade 1. Sam. 13.1, 2. <hi>Saul reigned one yeare, and when he had reigned two years over Iſrael, Saul choſe him three thouſand men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c. &amp; then it follows v. 8. <hi>And he tarried ſeven dayes, according to the ſet time that Samuel had appointed,</hi> &amp;c. Either therefore we muſt conceive that this charge w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Samuel now gave to Saul, concerning his ſtaying for him at Gilgal, was ſo delivered by him, that Saul might know that it was meant of that particular time when he was to raiſe an army at Gilgal, that he might fight with the Philiſtines, which was at leaſt two years after this, c. 13.1.4. (which may well be; for happely Samuel expreſſed this charge more fully and particularly then it is here related) or elſe that it was mean: by Samuel indefinitely, of the firſt difficulties he ſhould meet w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> after the kingdome was ſettled upon him, to wit, that if he were in any ſtrait, &amp; Samuel were not with him, he ſhould then reſort to Gilgal, &amp; ſtay there for Samuel ſeven dayes, within which time he would not fail to come unto him, both to offer up ſacrifices for him, &amp; to direct him what he ſhould do. And this indeed ſeems to be moſt probable: for though Saul went not to Gilgal in his firſt enterpriſe againſt the king of Ammon, the reaſon of that was becauſe Samuel was then w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> him, c. 11.7. &amp; therefore that cannot be juſtly objected: ſo that this clauſe I conceive is added here by way of encouragement; <hi>viz.</hi> that as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was offered of any difficult &amp; perilous enterpriſe to be undertaken by Saul, Samuel would be ready to aſſiſt him, both by offering up ſacrifices in his behalf, and by advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him in all doubtfull caſes; onely withall he gives him charge to wait for him in Gilgal for that purpoſe ſeven dayes; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was doubtleſſe of God for the triall of Saul.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>What is this that is come unto the ſon of Kiſh? is Saul alſo amongſt the prophets?]</hi> Becauſe Saul had not been trained up amongſt the ſons of the Prophets, but in his fathers countrey-affairs, as when he was ſent to look the aſſes that were loſt, therefore they admired to hear him propheſie amongſt the prophets; inſomuch that in aftertimes this became a proverb among the Iſraelites, as it is in the next verſe, <hi>Is Saul alſo among the prophets?</hi> when they beheld any thing in any man that was ſtrange and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42229:135"/>
Paul, Rom. 11.1. Is Saul alſo among the Apoſtles? Acts 9.21. <hi>All that heard him were amazed, and ſaid, Is not this he that deſtroyed them which called on this name in Jeruſalem?</hi> &amp;c. Yea, and ſo it was alſo with Chriſt and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Becauſe they were not trained up in a way of learning, they wondered to find them endued with thoſe excellent gifts which God had beſtowed upon them. Matt. 13.55, 56. <hi>Is not this the Carpenters ſonne?</hi> (ſay the Jews of Chriſt) <hi>whence then hath this man all theſe things?</hi> and John 7.15. <hi>The Jews marvelled, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, How knows this man letters having never learned?</hi> and when the Apoſtles ſpake divers languages at the feaſt of Pentecoſt, Acts 2.7, 8. <hi>They were all amazed and marvelled, ſaying one to another; Behold are not all theſe which ſpeak Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans? And how heare we every man in our tongue wherein we were born?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And one of the ſame place anſwered and ſaid, But who is their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?]</hi> Three ſeverall expoſitions are given of theſe words; for firſt, ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it to have been ſpoken concerning Saul and his ſervant, (as inferring from theſe words, that he alſo propheſied among the Prophets together with Saul) and that to expreſſe the reaſon why it ſeemed ſo ſtrange to them, that Saul and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould propheſie among the Prophets; namely, becauſe their fathers being countrey-men, men unskilfull in muſick and prophecying, could never inſtruct them in ſuch high things. Secondly, others conceive it was by way of amplifying the wonder of Sauls prophecying among the Prophets; to wit, that ſome breaking out into thoſe words of admiration, What? <hi>is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> another neighbour that ſtood by, added, <hi>But who is their father?</hi> thereby willing them, as it were, to take notice that he did not onely prophecie among the Prophets, but was as <hi>their father,</hi> in the chief place among them, that he led them as their head, as Samuel the father of the Prophets was wont to do, being endued with a kind of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie and eminency of gifts above the reſt that prophecyed with him; which did much increaſe the wonder. And thirdly, others conceive that this was ſpoken by way of correcting thoſe that made ſuch a matter of wonder of it, that Saul ſhould prophecie among the Prophets; <hi>But who is their father?</hi> ſaid one that ſtood by and heard them; that is, the father of thoſe Prophets among whom Saul prophecyed? as if he ſhould have ſaid, Is not God their father? did not he teach and inſtruct them? and is not he able to give the ſame gift of prophecie to Saul that he hath given to them? thoſe that were trained up in the Colledges of the Prophets, were called <hi>the ſonnes of the Prophets,</hi> 2. Kings 2.3. Now becauſe that which theſe men wondered at was, that one not trained up under the father or fathers of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhould be able to prophecie: To this it is anſwered, that it was God indeed that was their father, it was God that inſtructed them, and not the Prophets under whom they were trained up, and the ſame God that by his ſpirit enabled them to prophecie could likewiſe conferre the ſame gift upon Saul too: and this I conceive is the moſt probable expoſition of theſe words; and that becauſe the words ſeem plainly to imply, that they were ſpoken by way of anſwering thoſe that were ſo amazed, that Saul ſhould prophecy among the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And when he had made an end of prophecying, he came to the high place.]</hi> To wit, to praiſe God for his ſingular favour, and to pray to him for the aſſiſtance and guidance of his holy ſpirit: for in this high place no doubt they
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42229:135"/>
uſed to ſacrifice, and had perhaps a ſynagogue and houſe of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And Sauls uncle ſaid unto him, and to his ſervant, Whither went ye?]</hi> It is likely that this uncle of Sauls, was Ner the father of Abner, chap. 14.50. and that ſeeing Saul prophecie among the Prophets, or at leaſt hearing of it, he enquired thus where they had been, as thinking thereby to find it out how he ſhould come to this extraordinary gift: for by this change that was ſeen in him, he concluded that ſome ſtrange thing had happened to him in his journey.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>But of the matter of the kingdome, whereof Samuel ſpake, he told him not.]</hi> This is noted, doubtleſſe by way of commending Saul; and three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be probably given why Saul forbare to tell his uncle what Samuel had ſaid to him concerning the kingdome, notwithſtanding that by the late accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe ſeverall ſignes that Samuel had given him, he might be aſſured that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel was indeed ſent of God to anoint him king, to wit, Firſt, becauſe he was not at firſt puffed up with this dignity that God had conferred upon him, but of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and humble ſpirit, and therefore not prone to boaſt and brag of it, as others would have been. Secondly, becauſe he feared to provoke his uncle and others of his family and kindred to envy him for this honour, to which God had deſigned him. And thirdly, becauſe he remembred how carefull Samuel had been to anoint him in ſecret where no body ſhould be preſent, chap. 9.25, 26, 27. which was intimation enough to Saul, not to diſcover this ſecret till God ſhould himſelf openly make known his will herein. Notwithſtanding this prudence of Saul in concealing what had paſſed betwixt Samuel and him, yet when he was publickly choſen, certain ſonnes of Belial did openly deſpiſe him, verſ. 27. and what then would they have done had it been known that Samuel had beforehand anointed him? would not this have been a fair pretence for them to have ſaid, that this had been plotted beforehand betwixt Samuel and him?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to Mizpeh.]</hi> See the note upon Judges 20.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, I brought up Iſrael out of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] This recitall of the mercies which God had afforded the Iſraelites is premiſed, for the aggravation of their preſent ſinne in rejecting the government which God had eſtabliſhed amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And ye have this day rejected your God,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, by your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a king, the buſineſſe which this day you are come about. And herein doth Samuel covertly ſtrike at their willfull perſiſting in this their requiring a king. Samuel had done what he could to beat them from it; but they continued reſolved that ſo they would have it: whereupon it was, that he had now called them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to diſcover by lots who it was that God had choſen: and therefore Samuel uſeth theſe words, <hi>Ye have this day rejected your God,</hi> &amp;c. See the notes, chap. 8.7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now therefore preſent your ſelves before the Lord by your tribes, and by your thouſands.]</hi> That is, your families, Mich. 5.2. <hi>But thou Beth-leem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Iſrael:</hi> and this was done, that by caſting lots it might be diſcovered whom God had choſen to be their king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Therefore they enquired of the Lord further, if the man ſhould yet
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42229:136"/>
come thither.]</hi> To wit, either by Urim and Thummim in the high Preiſt, or by deſiring Samuel as a Prophet to enquire of the Lord for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Lord anſwered, Behold, he hath hid himſelf among the ſtuff.]</hi> That is, among the publick carriages of the camp, or among the baggage and implements of his own tent, and this he did out of modeſty, as not deeming himſelf fit for ſo high an advancement, or able to bear ſo great a burden, eſpecially the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael being in ſuch an unſettled and perillous condition as now it was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdome,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, both the duty of the king towards his ſubjects, and the ſubjects toward their king; and theſe were the fundamentall laws of the kingdome: all, which <hi>he wrote in a book,</hi> as it follows in the next words, <hi>and laid it up before the Lord,</hi> that is, before the Ark, or in the Tabernacle; and the reaſons why this book vvas thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laid up before the Lord, we may well conceive were theſe: Firſt, for the ſure preſervation of it: Secondly, to ſignifie that even theſe civill laws were <hi>the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God,</hi> which men were bound to obey, <hi>not onely for wrath, but for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake,</hi> Rom. 13.2, 5. And thirdly, to intimate, that God would take care of thoſe laws to uphold and maintain them, and to puniſh thoſe that ſhould vilifie and break them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And there went with him a band of men, whoſe hearts God had touched.]</hi> Though he was but a mean man to ſpeak of, and onely yet choſen and deſigned to the kingdome, not inthroned, (for afterward he was ſolemnly confirmed and ſettled in the kingdome) yet ſome were moved of God to think that it was fit they ſhould attend upon him in his return home, and accordingly there was a band of men who did voluntarily yeild him this ſervice, going along with him as a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all guard, to attend and conduct him on the way.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>But the children of Belial ſaid, How ſhall this man ſave us? and they deſpiſed him and brought him no preſents.]</hi> Becauſe Saul was but a mean man to ſpeak of, therefore there was a company of proud, diſſolute, lawleſſe wretches that deſpiſed him, as one altogether unfit to be king, and unlikely to govern them and defend them from their enemies as a king ſhould do; and hence it was, that they brought him no preſents, as it ſeems the reſt of the people did, to wit, as a ſigne of their ſubjection and their acknowledging him to be their king: for that was the cuſtome of thoſe times, as is noted concerning Jehoſhaphat, 2. Chron. 17.5. <hi>The Lord eſtabliſhed the kingdome in his hand, and all Judah brought to Jehoſhaphat preſents;</hi> whence it was alſo, that when the wiſe men had found out Chriſt, to whom they were directed by a ſtarre as the king of the Jews, <hi>they fell down and worſhiped him,</hi> Matt. 2.11. <hi>And when they had opened their treaſures they preſented unto him gifts, gold and frankincenſe and myrrhe.</hi> And indeed obſervable it is, that though the Lord was highly diſpleaſed with the Iſraelites for deſiring a king, yet when he had once choſen Saul to be their king, and conferred the royall dignity upon him, thoſe that deſpiſed him, and would not ſubmit to his government, are for that branded to be <hi>children of Belial,</hi> concerning which expreſſion, ſee the note Deut. 13.13.</p>
                  <p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen Nahaſh the Ammonite came up, and encamped againſt Jabeſh-Gilead.]</hi> A city without Jordan nigh unto the Ammonites. This inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was brewing againſt the Iſraelites before they deſired a king, and was in part the occaſion of that their deſire, chap. 12.12. <hi>And when ye ſaw that Nahaſh the king of the children of Ammon came againſt you, ye ſaid unto me, Nay, but a king ſhall reigne over us, when the Lord your God was your king.</hi> But now happely it was the more haſtened by Nahaſh the Ammonite, becauſe of the report which might be brought to him of the Iſraelites ſhaking off the government of Samuel, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a king to reigne over them, and the diviſion newly begun amongſt them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſcontent of ſome, who would not acknowledge their new choſen king. What they made the ground of their quarrell it is not expreſſed: Like enough it was that old pretence which they ſtood upon, Judg. 11.13. when Jephtha foyled them, to wit, a claim which they laid to the land of Gilead, where Jabeſh ſtood; which now to recover, and withall to revenge that ſhamefull overthrow which Jephtha had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, they might be the rather emboldened, becauſe the Philiſtines on the other ſide of the countrey, had exceedingly weakned and oppreſſed the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thruſt out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproch upon all Iſrael.]</hi> To wit, to diſable them for the warre (for with their ſhields they covered their left eyes, and therefore having loſt their right eyes, what ſervice of warre could they be fit for?) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the accepting of ſuch diſhonourable conditions, might be a perpetuall reproch to all the people, becauſe it would be ſaid hereupon, what a baſe people the Iſraelites were, that would buy off death upon any terms; yea to the God of Iſrael, on whom his people durſt not rely for help: and thus Sathan labours to put out the right eye of faith, and to leave us onely the left eye of reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Then came the meſſengers to Gibeah of Saul,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as to other towns ſo alſo to this: or rather, knowing that Saul their Prince elect was at Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, and Samuel with him, theſe meſſengers of Jabeſh-gilead went directly thither, that they might acquaint them with the extremity of ſtreights they were in, that ſo they might ſpeedily ſend into all the coaſts of Iſrael for help. Had Nahaſh the king of the Ammonites yielded to the ſubmiſſion of the inhabitants of Jabeſh-gilead, he might not only have had that town delivered up to him, but in all probability many more would have yielded themſelves to him after their example. Yea, and when they deſired ſeven dayes reſpite, that they might ſend meſſengers into all the coaſts of Iſrael, promiſing that if in that time they had not help, they would yield up the town, had not he yielded to this, he might happely in that time have taken the town by force. But firſt he proudly and ſcornfully refuſed the tender of their ſervice, and ſent them word that nothing ſhould ſatisfie him, unleſſe he might thruſt out all their right eyes; and when they deſired a truce of ſeven dayes, to try if they could call in their brethren to their aid, ere they yielded to ſo hard a condition, he granted them their requeſt, and (as we ſee here) ſuffered them to ſend their meſſengers, as being puft up with ſuch an opinion of his own ſtrength, that he thought it impoſſible that in that time their brethren either could or durſt come to relieve them; and ſo by this
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42229:137"/>
means, through his arrogancy and cruelty he was carried headlong to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, whereas by granting them fair quarter, he might have brought them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his yoke, and have ſpread his victories much further.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field.]</hi> Being onely yet elected king. and finding many to repine againſt it, returning home he betook himſelf, as moſt Interpreters hold, to his wonted countrey imployments. But this agreeing not with the ſtate of his being conducted home, chap. 10.26 may rather be underſtood of caſuall coming after the herd, and that it is here expreſſed onely becauſe of that which followeth his taking a yoke of the oxen, and hewing them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the ſpirit of God came upon Saul when he heard thoſe tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.]</hi> Herein we ſee how fairly Saul carried himſelf as long as thoſe gifts of Gods ſpirit were continued to him, wherewith the Lord had fitted him for the government of his people. He that was ſo patient in his own cauſe, that when certain children of Belial ſcorned and deſpiſed him, he paſſed it by as if he had taken no notice of it, chap. 10.27. was now impatient of the wrong that was done to the Lord and his people by the Ammonites, that had propounded ſuch intollerable conditions to the men of Jabeſh-gilead; now <hi>his anger was kindled greatly,</hi> and it never abated till he had reſcued his poore oppreſſed brethren out of the danger they were in. As for that expreſſion, <hi>And the ſpirit of God came upon Saul,</hi> ſee the note Judg. 3.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Whoſoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, ſo ſhall it be done unto his oxen.]</hi> It may well be that Saul took this courſe of hewing a yoke of oxen in pieces, and ſending the pieces to the ſeverall tribes of Iſrael, in imitation of the Levite Judg. 19.29. who did thus cut his concubine in pieces, and ſent them to the ſeverall tribes, the better to ſtirre up their indignation. And in the meſſage he ſent to the tribes, becauſe he was not yet generally approved and received as king of all the people, he uſeth not his own name onely, but Samuels alſo (who it ſeems ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him home from Mizpeh as others did, chap. 10.26. and ſo was now with him) that by this means he might make ſure that all ſhould come; if not for reſpect of him their king, yet out of regard had to Samuel, Gods Prophet, and formerly their Judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the fear of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out with one conſent.]</hi> That is, though Saul did what he could to make the people afraid to diſobey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet it was of God that they were ſo generally ſtricken with fear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ready to come forth at the command of their new choſen king: as it is ſaid of the Canaanites that were reſtrained from purſuing Jacob and his family, when his ſonnes had made that maſſacre in Schechem; Gen. 35.5. <hi>And they journeyed; and the terrour of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not purſue after the ſonnes of Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>The children of Iſrael were three hundred thouſand, and the men of Judah thirty thouſand.]</hi> The men of Judah are reckoned apart from the children of Iſrael; and theſe reaſons may be given for it: 1. Becauſe they uſually had the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of going firſt againſt the enemy, in any common danger: 2. To let us ſee that the tribe of Judah, though the chief, and the tribe wherein God had ſaid the throne ſhould be eſtabliſhed, Gen. 49.10. yielded to obey Saul choſen out of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42229:137"/>
leaſt of the tribes: or thirdly, becauſe this would intimate how willingly the people flocked together, when out of Judah alone there came thirty thouſand, though by the continuall incurſions of the Philiſtines, they were forced to look to the defence of their own coaſts againſt theſe their neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And they ſaid unto the meſſengers that came,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Saul and Samuel.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Therefore the men of Jabeſh ſaid, To morrow we will come out unto you,</hi> &amp;c.] They repeat the main head of the covenant they had made with the king of Ammon, to wit, that they would come forth and yield themſelves, concealing the condition, that is, if help came not in the mean time; by concealing whereof they both provide for their own ſafetie, that nothing might be preſently attempted againſt them, and make their enemies the more ſecure, that Saul might come upon them unawares.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Saul put the people in three companies, and they came into the midſt of the host in the morning watch,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems Saul marched all night, that by the morning watch he might come upon them, and ſurpriſe them unawares. And thus he raiſed the ſiege of Jabeſh-gilead, and freed them from that horrid cruelty which the enemy entended againſt them; and how thankfull the inhabitants of this citie were to Saul for this great benefit they enjoyed by his means, we may ſee chap. 31.11, 12, 13. <hi>And when the inhabitants of Jabeſh-gilead heard of that which the Philiſtins had done to Saul; All the valiant men aroſe, and went all night, and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his ſonnes from the wall of Beth-ſhan, and came to Jabeſh, and burnt them there. And they took their bones and buried them under a tree, and faſted ſeven dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Saul ſaid, There ſhall not a man be put to death this day; for to day the Lord hath wrought ſalvation for Iſrael.]</hi> In this reaſon that Saul gave why he would not ſuffer any man to be put to death that day, <hi>for to day the Lord hath wrought ſalvation in Iſrael,</hi> two things may be implyed: firſt, that he would not have a day of ſo much joy and triumph, ſtained with the leaſt ſorrow and mourning amongſt any of the people: and ſecondly, that when God had ſhewn himſelf ſo good and gracious to his people, he could not think it fit to be ſo rigid &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt thoſe that had at firſt ſlighted him in his ſovereignty. However here again we ſee what a difference there was betwixt that which Saul was in his firſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he was afterwards when the Spirit of the Lord was departed from him. Now none more humble and gentle then he, not a man ſhould be put to death for him; but afterwards in his dealing with David, and the Prieſts of the Lord, he was another man, even bloud-thirſty, cruell, and implacable beyond meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Then ſaid Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdome there.]</hi> A city this was near hand, adjoyning upon Jordan; there Joſhua renewed the covenant betwixt the Lord and his people, Joſh. 5.9. and there Samuel now renewed the covenant concerning the kingdome betwixt Saul and the people. Before he was choſen, but this was as it were the ſolemnity of his inauguration and coronation: and now it ſeems he was anointed in publick as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in private; and therefore in the next chapter, Samuel ſpeaking to the people, calls Saul ſeverall times, <hi>the Lords Anointed.</hi>

                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:42229:138"/>Verſ. 15. <hi>And there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal; and there they ſacrificed,</hi> &amp;c.] It is evident therefore, that here now Saul and Samuel ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced together in Gilgal; whence we may certainly conclude, that the charge which Samuel gave to Saul, chap. 10.8. that he ſhould ſtay for Samuel at Gilgal ſeven dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till he came to offer ſacrifice for him, was not meant of Sauls immediate going to Gilgal, but of his going thither when he ſhould be in a ſtrait, and had not Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el with him, as is before noted in the expoſition of that place.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Samuel ſaid unto all Iſrael, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye ſaid unto me,</hi> &amp;c.] Samuel preſſeth them now more cloſely and ſharply then ever, with their ſinne in rejecting the government which God had eſtabliſhed among them: firſt, becauſe in this their jollity, for that glorious victory which their new king had obtained againſt the Ammonites, they were in danger to be puffed up with an opinion, that God approved that which they had done, and that they had not ſinned in deſiring a king: ſecondly, becauſe having eſtabliſhed Saul in the throne, &amp; actually reſigned the government into his hands, he might now ſpeak the more freely, without giving the leaſt ground of ſuſpition that he was loth to give over the government, and therefore condemned them for choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And now behold, the king walketh before you.]</hi> This is meant of Sauls being now ſettled in the ſupreme magiſtracy, as a ſhepherd or captain to lead and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the people, and to be as a ſhield unto them, to ſtand betwixt them and harms way: the like phraſe there is Numb. 27.17. concerning which ſee the note there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I am old, and gray-headed, and behold, my ſonnes are with you.]</hi> To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply how good cauſe he had to be very well content in regard of himſelf, that the burden of the government ſhould be taken from his ſhoulders, he wiſheth them to remember that he was now grown aged, <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>old and gray-headed,</hi> and then he addes, <hi>and behold my ſonnes are with you,</hi> that is, they are amongſt you, as one of you, they ſhall lay no claim to the government no more then I do; ſo that this he ſaith: either firſt, the more to clear his integrity who was willing his ſonnes ſhould lay down the power of government as well as himſelf: or ſecondly, to intimate that if they could charge him for any wrong done, his ſonnes ſhould make ſatisfaction: or elſe to imply, that of them they might be ſatisfied concerning his courſe of life; and particularly, whether he did any way incourage them in thoſe wicked courſes they ranne into, chap. 8.3.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Behold, here I am, witneſſe againſt me before the Lord, and before his anointed,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, being now the power of government is transferred to another, ye need not fear to ſpeak your minds of me, and therefore if ye can accuſe me of any evil, ſpeak it freely. And this proteſtation of his innocency he makes: Firſt, that he might the more freely reprove them. Secondly, to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the greivouſneſſe of their ſinne, who had without any juſt cauſe rejected the government which God had erected among them. And thirdly, to propound this covertly, as a pattern for their new choſen king to follow, before whom all this was ſpoken, <hi>witneſſe against me before the Lord, and before his Anointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:42229:138"/>Verſ. 7. <hi>Now therefore ſtand ſtill, that I may reaſon with you before the Lord, of all the righteous acts of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, both mercies and puniſhmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>; but cheifly I conceive this is meant of his mercies, wherein the Lord approved his faithfulneſſe, in performing the covenant which he had made with them; for theſe he preſſeth upon them, to diſcover the hainouſneſſe of their ſinne in rejecting his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who had ſo carefully protected them againſt all their enemies, and ſo abundantly bleſſed them in every regard.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>The Lord ſent Moſes and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.]</hi> This making them to dwell in the land of Canaan, is aſcribed to Moſes and Aaron: Firſt, becauſe they led the people from Egypt through the wilderneſſe, and brought them unto the land which God had promiſed them: and ſecondly, becauſe Moſes put them in poſſeſſion of that part of the land which was without Jordan, and ſubſtituted Joſhua in his place, who afterward gave them the poſſeſſion of the reſt of the land. But the chief thing intended, is to put them in mind of Gods mercy in giving them that land, without whom, neither Moſes, nor Aaron, nor Joſhua could have done it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And when they forgat the Lord their God, he ſold them into the hand of Siſera,</hi> &amp;c.] Samuel here calls the rebellion of the Iſraelites againſt God, a forgetting of the Lord; becauſe if men did indeed think upon God as they ought to do they would not dare ſo to tranſgreſſe his commandments: and thence it is alſo, that David ſaith of wicked men, that <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10.4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And the Lord ſent Jerubbaal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive that Jair is here called Bedan, and that to diſtinguiſh him from that former Jair of whom Moſes ſpeaks, Numb. 32.41. and indeed there is one Bedan a Manaſſite mentioned, 1. Chron. 7.17. Others again think that this Bedan was ſome Judge of Iſrael, that is not mentioned in the book of Judges. But the more common, and I think the more probable expoſition is, that Samſon is here meant, and that he is called Bedan, becauſe he was of the tribe of Dan; for <hi>Bedan</hi> ſignifieth <hi>in Dan,</hi> or, <hi>of Dan,</hi> and Bendan ſignifieth <hi>the ſonne of Dan.</hi> As for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels ſpeaking of himſelf as of a third perſon, it is uſuall in the Scripture, as we ſee Gen. 4.23. <hi>And Lamech ſaid unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my ſpeech: for I have ſlain a man to my wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a young man to my hurt.</hi> He particularly puts them in mind of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them by him, becauſe the deliverance which God had given them by him, was beſt known to them, and beſt ſerved to condemn them for rejecting in his dayes that government which God had ſettled among them, and that in part for fear of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Then ſhall both ye, and alſo the king that reigneth over you, continue following the Lord your God.]</hi> That is, God will not deſtroy you, but you ſhall ſtill continue a peculiar people to the Lord, ſhrouded under his conduct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Is it not wheat-harveſt to-day? I will call unto the Lord, and he ſhall ſend thunder and rain.]</hi> In Paleſtina thunder and rain in wheat-harveſt was moſt unuſuall, whence is that of Solomon. Prov. 26.1. <hi>As ſnow in ſummer, and as rain in harveſt: ſo honour is not ſeemly for a fool:</hi> and that Amos 4.7. <hi>And alſo I
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42229:139"/>
have with-holden the rain from you, when there were yet three moneths to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest; and I cauſed it to rain upon one city, and cauſed it not to rain upon another city.</hi> Now the rather did the Lord convince them of their ſinne by this miracle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereby they might ſee their folly, both in rejecting the Lord, ſuch a mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour, who was able by thunder to deſtroy their enemies, as they had ſeen formerly chap. 7.10. and likewiſe in rejecting Samuel, who could by his prayers fetch down thunder and rain from heaven.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And the Lord ſent thunder and rain that day.]</hi> To wit, in ſome very extraordinary manner, in ſo much that the people were not onely fully convinced hereby, that they had ſinned in deſiring a king, but were alſo afraid that by this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempeſt they ſhould have been deſtroyed; whence is that in the following verſe, <hi>Pray for thy ſervants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And Samuel ſaid unto the people, Fear not.]</hi> That is, deſpair not of Gods goodneſſe and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And turn ye not aſide: for then ſhould ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver.]</hi> Idols may be the vain things here principally meant, as Deut. 32.21. <hi>They have moved me to jealouſie with that which is not God, they have provoked me to anger with their vanities:</hi> and Jer. 2.5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone farre from me, and have walked after vanitie, and are become vain?</hi> but withall we may well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of every thing elſe, wherein they ſhould ſeek for help and happineſſe, having turned aſide from following the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>For the Lord will not forſake his people, for his great names ſake.]</hi> That is, becauſe Gods name is called upon you, and ſo it would not be for his glory to forſake you; and indeed all the good which God doth for his Church and people, is more for his own glory, then for any good he ſees in them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Moreover, as for me, God forbid that I ſhould ſinne againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you.]</hi> They had deſired him to pray for them, verſ. 19. but the injury they had done him might make them fear he would not regard them; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe the thunder he had prayed for, might argue ſome diſpleaſure conceived in him againſt them, and therefore he aſſures them that he would not ceaſe neither to pray for them, nor to inſtruct them, <hi>but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will teach you the good and the right way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Onely fear the Lord, and ſerve him in truth,</hi> &amp;c.] As though he ſhould ſay, elſe my praying for you will do you no good.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>SAul reigned one yeare, and when he had reigned two years over Iſrael.]</hi> The firſt clauſe, <hi>Saul reigned one yeare</hi> hath reference to the time when thoſe things were done, mentioned in the two former chapters; when Saul by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his victory over the Ammonites, and his raiſing the ſiege of Jabeſh-gilead, was at Gilgal confirmed and ſolemnly inaugurated king of Iſrael, then he had reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one yeare, to wit, from the time that he was choſen and publickly declared king at Mizpeh, chap. 10.24. and then the ſecond clauſe, <hi>And when he had reigned two years over Iſrael,</hi> hath relation to that which is here related in this chapter, to wit,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42229:139"/>
that a full yeare after his ſolemne inauguration at Gilgal, when he had in all reigned two years, then he began to raiſe an army of three thouſand men, as intending now to drive the Philiſtines out of thoſe forts which they held in the land of Iſrael, and to ſave the people from the cruell oppreſſion of thoſe their inſulting enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the reſt of the people he ſent every man to his tent.]</hi> Having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the people to aſſemble themſelves as at other times, out of them he choſe three thouſand to be in arms with him and his ſonne Jonathan, and the reſt he diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Jonathan ſmote the garriſon of the Philiſtines that was in Geba.]</hi> That is, in Gibeah of Benjamin: One main reaſon why Saul had raiſed an army of three thouſand Iſraelites, was doubtleſſe that they might ſurpriſe all thoſe garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which the Philiſtines kept in the land of Iſrael, wherewith they did mightily oppreſſe the Iſraelites, and kept them in ſuch miſerable bondage, that they would not ſuffer them to have any weapons of warre, (but what they got by ſtealth, or kept hid in ſome ſecret place) nor would let a ſmith live among them, leaſt by that means they ſhould get them ſwords or ſpears, as is afterwards expreſſed, verſ. 19. Jonathan therefore having a thouſand of theſe new muſtered forces to be under his command, did preſently addreſſe himſelf to this work, and went and ſmote a garriſon of the Philiſtins in Gibeah; making this no doubt his firſt enterpriſe, becauſe Gibeah was his own countrey, the place where his father and anceſtours had lived before him, chap. 10.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, ſaying, Let the Hebrews heare.]</hi> That is, he gave order to the meſſengers he ſent abroad, to proclaim and to make known in all parts by the ſound of a trumpet, both the victory which Jonathan had gotten for their encouragement, and how the Philiſtines were hereupon enraged, and made great preparations againſt them, that having this warning, they might in every place take heed to themſelves, and that they might ſend further forces from all parts to be with him at Gilgal.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And all Iſrael heard ſay, that Saul had ſmitten a garriſon of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines.]</hi> Though it was Jonathan that ſmote the garriſon, yet it is here aſcribed to Saul, becauſe uſually that which a kings Generalls do, that the king himſelf is ſaid to do; and beſides it is probable, that it was expreſſely made known to the people, that Jonathan had not done this without Sauls approbation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.]</hi> Becauſe Samuel, chap. 10.8. had appointed Saul that he ſhould go down to Gilgal (to wit, if he came to be in any danger, or took occaſion to attempt any thing againſt the Philiſtines) and ſhould there wait for him ſeven dayes, till he came and adviſed him what he ſhould do, and offered ſacrifice both for him and for the people, therefore was Gilgal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the rendevouz for the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>When the men of Iſrael ſaw that they were in a ſtreight (for the people were diſtreſſed,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, their apprehenſion of the danger they were in was not without cauſe: for they were indeed in great diſtreſſe, the enemies being innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and withall ſtrong and well armed with horſes and chariots, and the Iſraelites on the other ſide but few in number, and thoſe either unarmed, or very poorely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to joyn in battel with that mighty army of the Philiſtines. And thus they that erewhile repoſed all their hope of ſafety in having a king, did now follow their
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42229:140"/>
king trembling as it follows verſ. 7. and were taught, that without Gods aſſiſtance all humane devices and counſell are nothing worth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And he tarried ſeven dayes, according to the ſet time that Samuel had appointed.]</hi> That is, he tarried untill the ſeventh day, and part of that; for that he tarried not till the ſeven dayes were out, as Samuel had appointed, chap. 10.8. is evident in the thirteenth verſe of this chapter, where Samuel reproves him, becauſe he had not herein kept the commandment of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And Saul ſaid, Bring hither a burnt-offering to me, and peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.]</hi> That is, the Preiſts for him. As Elkanah did, chap. 1.3. <hi>And this man went up out of his city yearly, to worſhip and to ſacrifice unto the Lord of hoſts in Shiloh:</hi> and Solomon, 1. Kings 3.4. <hi>And the king went to Gibeon to ſacrifice there, for that was the great high place: a thouſand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</hi> Some conceive that he did it himſelf, and that this was the ſinne for which Samuel afterward reproved him, to wit, that he intruded himſelf into the Prieſts office. But this is not probable: firſt, becauſe Samuel being a Levite not a Prieſt, might not offer ſacrifice by the ordinary rule of the Law, no more then Saul: and therefore Sauls ſtaying for Samuel ſeven dayes, was not enjoyned upon this ground, becauſe it was lawfull for him to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, not for Saul. And ſecondly, becauſe Saul afterward excuſeth himſelf, that what he had done contrary to the commandment of the Lord, he was conſtrained by neceſſity to do it: but for this ſacrificing himſelf without a Prieſt, he could pretend no neceſſity, Ahiah the high Prieſt the ſonne of Phinehas being then with him in the camp, chap. 14.3. Doubtleſſe therefore the ſinne of Saul was this, that having received a charge from the Lord by Samuel, chap. 10.8. that he ſhould ſtay for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel at Gilgal ſeven dayes, and not reſolve upon any thing till he came, when they were to offer up ſacrifices unto the Lord, and Samuel was to adviſe Saul what he ſhould do; Saul having ſtayed till the ſeventh day was almoſt expired, began to conclude that Samuel would not come, and fearing leaſt if he ſtaid any longer, his ſouldiers might all ſlink away, or that the Philiſtines might fall upon them on a ſuddain, before they had by ſacrifices ſought the Lords favour and help, he reſolved not to ſtay any longer for Samuel, for fear of the worſt, (which argued his diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſtruſt in God) and thereupon commanded ſacrifices to be offered, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending after that was done, to pitch upon ſome courſe or other for the defence of themſelves and their countrey againſt the Philiſtines. This I ſay was Sauls ſinne, not that he himſelf offered ſacrifices; for this Samuel never charged him with.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>As ſoon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold Samuel came.]</hi> And thus for want of ſtaying an houre or two longer then he did, perhaps leſſe, he brake the commandment of God and forfeited his kingdome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And went out to meet him that he might ſalute him.]</hi> The rather happely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe out of a guilty conſcience he feared Samuels diſpleaſure, and by this externall reverence, therefore ſought to prevent it, and to let him ſee, that what he had done was not done out of any contempt of the directions which he had given him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Samuel ſaid, What haſt thou done?]</hi> He ſaw well enough what he had done: But by theſe words of diſcontent, <hi>What haſt thou done?</hi> he expreſſeth his diſpleaſure againſt him, and withall the danger that Saul was in, becauſe of this his diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:42229:140"/>
                     <hi>And Saul ſaid, Becauſe I ſaw that the people were ſcattered from me, and that thou cameſt not within the dayes appointed,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe words Saul intimates, that becauſe a great part of the ſeventh day was paſt, he conceived that Samuel would not have come within the appointed time; and ſo he ſeeks to caſt the blame upon Samuel, rather then he would acknowledge himſelf in a fault.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>I forced my ſelf therefore, and offered a burnt offering.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, It went againſt me to ſacrifice before thou wert come, but I was conſtrained by neceſſity, I could ſtay no longer unleſſe I would have ſuffered the enemy to come upon this weak unarmed company, before we had made ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord; and what a diſadvantage would that have been?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Samuel ſaid to Saul, Thou haſt done fooliſhly; thou haſt not kept the commandment of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe he waited not for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel all the ſeven dayes, as Samuel had appointed him, chap. 10.8. See the note above, verſ. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For now would the Lord have eſtabliſhed thy kingdome upon Iſrael for ever.]</hi> This may ſeem to contradict that prophecy of the eſtabliſhing the kingdome in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahs tribe, Gen. 49.10. <hi>The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, untill Shiloh come: and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be.</hi> But we muſt know that God ſpeaks here to the capacity and according to the ſight and judgement of man, and therefore without reſpect to Gods decree which is ſecret to man, teacheth us to judge of Sauls rejection as a fruit of ſinne, and his ſuppoſed obedience as that which might have been a means to confirm the kingdome to him and his. For whereas ſome underſtand theſe words thus, <hi>The Lord would have eſtabliſhed thy kingdome upon Iſrael for ever,</hi> that is, all thy dayes; that cannot I conceive be the meaning, becauſe Saul did enjoy the kingdome all his life; whereas Samuel ſpeaks here of ſomething God would have done for him, if he had obeyed the commandment of the Lord which now by his ſinne he had forfeited and loſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>But now thy kingdome ſhall not continue; the Lord hath ſought him a man after his own heart,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the kingdome ſhall not now be ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee and thy poſterity, as it ſhould have been, but God hath provided himſelf of another man to ſucceed thee in the throne; and this was David, a man after Gods own heart, whoſe heart was ſincerely bent to do all the will of God, even according to Gods own heart, which could not be ſaid of Saul that alwayes had an hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall heart; <hi>and the Lord,</hi> ſaith Samuel, <hi>hath commanded him to be captain over his people,</hi> &amp;c. that is, he hath decreed to give him the charge of governing his people. It was ſome time after this ere Samuel was ſent to anoint David; onely becauſe God had firmly decreed that it ſhould ſo be, therefore Samuel ſpeaks of it, as if it were done already; <hi>The Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people;</hi> and ſo we ſee elſewhere, the Lord expreſſeth his decree concerning the ravens feeding Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, <hi>I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there,</hi> 1. Kings 17.4. It may ſeem ſtrange indeed that the kingdome ſhould be removed from Sauls family for ſo ſmall an offence as one would judge this of Sauls to have been; for what great matter was there in it, that Saul ſhould offer a ſacrifice perhaps an houre or two before it ſhould have been done? for, firſt, there was no hurt in the thing it ſelf, it
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42229:141"/>
was a part of Gods worſhip in the Law enjoyned: and ſecondly, it was done but a very little while before it ſhould have been done; Samuel had appointed Saul to wait for him ſeven dayes and he had waited till the ſeventh day was almoſt ended: thirdly, conſidering what a mighty army the Philiſtines had, not farre from him, and how many of his own people were runne away from him, and how full of fears the reſt were that remained with him, it might argue a great deal of courage and confidence in God, that he durſt ſtay there ſo long as he did: and fourthly, it was out of a good intention that he did not ſtay any longer, but offered a ſacrifice before Samuel came; namely, that he might not be ſet upon by the Philiſtines before he had made ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Lord, and that he might by this means encourage his fainthearted ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and prevent their running away after their fellows; and therefore I ſay it may perhaps ſeem ſtrange, that by this offence he ſhould looſe the kingdome. But for this we muſt conſider: firſt, that there may be much wickedneſſe of heart in doing that which may ſeem outwardly a ſmall offence: ſecondly, it cannot be a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſobey any commandment of God; the excellency of the perſon makes the diſobedience great, in whatever the offence is committed: and thirdly, Saul being the firſt king of Iſrael, God was pleaſed by this ſeverity againſt Saul for his firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt Gods command to make him an example to all that ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſucceed in that throne, that they might fear to tranſgreſſe the commandment of the Lord as he had done. As the Lord did with great ſeverity puniſh the firſt ſinne of the Prieſts, to wit, that of Nadab and Abihu, Levit. 10.1. that all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding poſterity of Aaron, might be rendred thereby the more warie how they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves in their preiſtly office; ſo likewiſe he did here ſharply puniſh the firſt ſinne of the firſt king of Iſrael, that all that ſhould afterwards ſit in that throne, might learn to be very ſtrict in obſerving whatever God ſhould give them in charge.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Samuel aroſe, and gat him up from Gilgal, unto Gibeah of Benjamin.]</hi> And Saul with him, or immediately after him, as is evident in the 16. verſe, <hi>And Saul and Jonathan his ſonne—abode in Gibeah of Benjamin:</hi> and indeed it is not likely that he would have gone nearer to the enemy (for Gibeah was farre nearer to Michmaſh where the Philiſtines were, then Gilgal) if he had not been encouraged by Samuel, eſpecially conſidering, that of his three thouſand ſouldiers mentioned verſ. 2. and the people that were afterward called to Gilgal, verſ. 4. there were now but ſix hundred left, and thoſe unarmed, and in great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour becauſe of the Philiſtines: unleſſe happely he went thither, becauſe it was his own city, a place of greater ſtrength, and better aſſured unto him then Gilgal was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philiſtines in thru companies,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe were ſent out to ſpoil the countrey, and to fetch in booty to the camp, and therefore they went out three ſeverall wayes, one to Ophrah a city of Benjamin, Joſh. 18.23. that lay ſouthweſt from Michmaſh; the other to Bethoron a city of Ephraim, Joſh. 16.3. that lay northweſt; and the third toward the valley of Zeboim, that is, the deſert of Jordan, which was eaſtward.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Now there was no ſmith found throughout all the land of Iſrael: (for the Philistines ſaid, Leſt the Hebrews make them ſwords or spears.]</hi> This they did after they had diſarmed them; and for the ſame cauſe it may well be that Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar carried away all the craftsmen and ſmiths out of the land of Iſrael, 2.

24.14. <hi>And he carried away all Jeruſalem, and all the Princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thouſand captives, and all the craftsmen and ſmiths:</hi> and Jer. 24.1. <hi>Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the ſon of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the Princes of Judah, with the carpenters and ſmiths from Jeruſalem, &amp; had brought them to Babylon.</hi> Now it is probable that the Philiſtines diſarmed the Iſraelites in thoſe dayes when the Ark was taken, and that ever ſince that time they had uſed this policy of keeping them from having any ſmith in Iſrael: for firſt, after that ſolemn repentance of the Iſraelites in the dayes of Samuel, chap. 7.3, 4. we reade not of any memorable victory which the Philiſtines obtained againſt the Iſraelites; but rather the contrary, chap. 7.13, 14. <hi>So the Philiſtines were ſubdued, and they came no more into the coaſt of Iſrael: and the hand of the Lord was against the Philiſtines all the dayes of Samuel. And the cities which the Philiſtines had taken from Iſrael, were reſtored to Iſrael, from Ekron even unto Gath, and the coaſt thereof did Iſrael deliver out of the hands of the Philistines:</hi> and ſecondly, though the Iſraelites prevailed often againſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, yet all this time they might have few other weapons but ſuch as in ancient times they moſt uſed, to wit, clubs, and bows, and ſlings, &amp;c. The chief victory they got was we ſee miraculous, not gotten with ſword or ſpeare, but with thunder from heaven, 1. Sam. 7.10. and thirdly, theſe craftsmen being once rooted out, in a ſhort peace under Samuel they could not eaſily be replanted again, the Philiſtines eſpecially keeping garriſons ſtill for this purpoſe in their land.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>But all the Iſraelites went down to the Philiſtines to ſharpen every man his ſhare and his coulter,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, either into the land of the Philiſtines, or rather to the garriſons of the Philiſtines that were in the land of Iſrael, where it ſeems they kept ſmiths for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>There was neither ſword nor speare found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan.]</hi> But how then a little before this did Jonathan ſmite the garriſon of the Philiſtines in Geba, verſ. 3. I anſwer, firſt, they might have clubs, and bows, and ſlings, and theſe were the moſt uſuall weapons in thoſe times, ſee 1. Chron. 12.1, 2. <hi>Now theſe are they that came to David to Zik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag, while he kept himſelf cloſe, becauſe of Saul the ſonne of Kiſh: and they were among the mighty men helpers of the warre. They were armed with bows, and could uſe both the right hand and the left in hurling stones, and ſhooting arrows out of a bow:</hi> Judg. 20.16. <hi>Among all this people there were ſeven hundred choſen men left-handed, every one could ſling ſtones at an hair breath, and not miſſe:</hi> ſecondly, ſome iron arms they might hide and keep ſecret from the Philiſtines: and thirdly, thoſe happely that were better armed of the three thouſand mentioned verſ. 2. were thoſe that fled from Saul, and the ſix hundred that ſtayed with him, were of the people that were come up to him unfurniſhed of ſuch arms: for it is very improbable which ſome ſay, that thoſe that ranne not away from Saul, but <hi>followed him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> as it is ſaid verſ. 7. did in their fear caſt away their arms, or leave them in the camp behind them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Ahiah the ſonne of Ahitub, Ichabodi brother,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he alſo was with Saul in Migron; and it ſeems becauſe of the ſtraits the people were in, he was come to bring the Ark thither, for the peoples encouragement, as they had been wont formerly to do in the like caſe; for in the 18. verſe it is expreſſely ſaid, that the Ark was there. It is evident that Ahimelech, who gave the ſhewbread and Goliahs ſword to David when he fled from Saul, and who was thereupon ſlain by Sauls command, was <hi>the ſonne of Ahitub,</hi> chap. 22.9. and it is generally held, that he was then high-prieſt; either therefore this Ahiah was the elder ſonne of Ahitub, and when he was dead then Ahimelech his brother ſucceeded him in the high-preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; or elſe this Ahiah, who was come with the Ark and the ephod to Saul, was the ſame that is there called Ahimelech, which indeed moſt Interpreters do hold. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of Eli (his ſonne Phinehas being before ſlain in the battell) Ahitub his grandchild, the ſonne of Phinehas ſucceeded him in the preiſthood, who it ſeems long enjoyed not that dignity, but dyed; (for God had threatned Eli that his children ſhould die in the flower of their age, chap. 2.23.) and ſo Ahiah his ſonne was now high-preiſt in his room.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And between the paſſages by which Jonathan ſought to go over unto the Philiſtines garriſon,</hi> &amp;c.] The diſcription of this place, through or over which Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan and his armour-bearer were to go, that they might come to the garriſon of the Philiſtines, is doubtleſſe here inſerted purpoſely to ſhew how hard an adventure it was that they undertook; but ſo exceeding intricate and obſcure it is, that it is very hard to conceive thereby, how theſe rocks and paſſages lay; which may be the reaſon, that the moſt Expoſitours do not ſo much as undertake to explain the many difficulties that are in the Text; and indeed all that can be ſaid herein, I conceive is this: It is evident that Michmaſh where the Philiſtines camp was, and Gibeah where Saul and Jonathan, and the forces of the Iſraelites were, chap. 13.16. lay North and South the one from the other; and that theſe two rocks here mentioned,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42229:142"/>
Bozez and Seneh lay together in the midſt, the one Northward, the other South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for how elſe could it be ſaid in the following verſe, that <hi>the forefront of the one was ſituate Northward over againſt Michmaſh, and the other Southward over againſt Gibeah?</hi> But now the difficulty is, how therefore it can be here ſaid, that theſe rocks were <hi>between the paſſages by which Jonathan ſought to go over,</hi> and yet withall, that <hi>there was a ſharp rock on the one ſide, and a ſharp rock on the other ſide,</hi> which ſeem to be contrary the one to the other. But for the reſolving of this, I know no other probable anſwer that can be given but this, to wit, firſt, that the paſſages between which the rocks are ſaid to be, were the two ſeverall ſtreights or inlets, whereat there was a paſſable way, though craggy through theſe rocks, the one as they came from Michmaſh to go to Gibeah, the other as they went from Gibeah to go to Michmaſh; ſo that indeed there was but one paſſage through theſe rocks (and that was ſurely the paſſage mentioned in the laſt verſe of the foregoing chapter, which the Philiſtines had ſurprized) onely the two inlets into this are the paſſages here intended, the one called the paſſage of Michmaſh, as we ſee chap. 13.23. the other the paſſage of Gibeah. And ſecondly, that whereas it is ſaid there was <hi>a ſharp rock on the one ſide, &amp; a ſharp rock on the other,</hi> the meaning is, not that as men went along in this paſſage there was a ſharp rock on each ſide, to wit, on the right hand and on the left (for the rocks ſtanding the one with the forefront Northward, and the other with the forefront Southward, that could not be. He that went through this paſſage from Gibeah to Michmaſh, muſt go over both rocks, one after another, and could not have one on his right hand, and the other on his left) but that there was a ſharp rock on the one ſide toward Michmaſh, and a ſharp rock on the other ſide toward Gibeah, which is mentioned to ſhew that unleſſe it were by that paſſage which the Philiſtines kept, there was no going over; a ſharp ſteep crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie rock making the way unpaſſeable in all other places; all which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Jonathan with his armour-bearer clambered over this rock on his hands and feet, and ſo got to the garriſon of the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Come, and let us go over unto the garriſon of theſe uncircumciſed.]</hi> This calling the Philiſtines uncircumciſed, was to intimate that Jonathan relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the covenant which God had made with his people, and conſequently upon the promiſes which the Lord had given them that they ſhould vanquiſh their enemies, and happely more particularly, upon that which the Lord had ſaid concerning Saul, that he ſhould ſave his people out of the hand of the Philiſtines, chap. 9.16. Yet he addes, <hi>It may be that the Lord will work for us;</hi> for though he were carried to this attempt by a powerfull inſtinct of Gods ſpirit, and a ſtrong faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, yet becauſe he had not a ſpeciall promiſe of victory at this time, he is not confident of the ſucceſſe, but leaveth that to God. <hi>It may be,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.]</hi> That is, as willing and ready to follow thee in this enterpriſe, as thine own ſoul can deſire.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>If they ſay thus unto us, Tarty untill we come to you; then we will ſtand ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c.] By the ſecret guidance of Gods holy ſpirit, he pitcheth no doubt upon this, as a ſigne whereby he ſhould know whether they might with hope of ſucceſſe undertake this attempt, and no doubt prayed that it might prove a true to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as Abrahams ſervant did in alike caſe, Gen. 24.13. (concerning which ſee the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42229:143"/>
note there.) Yet was not this choſen without ſome ground of naturall reaſon; for if they ſaid, <hi>Tarry untill we come to you,</hi> it might argue courage and boldneſſe: but if they ſaid, <hi>Come up to us,</hi> that might bewray ſome fearfulneſſe in them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And both of them diſcovered themſelves unto the garriſon of the Philiſtines,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in the way that led to the ordinary paſſage, which was now kept by the Philiſtines. As for that ſcoff of the Philiſtines when they eſpied them, <hi>Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes,</hi> ſee the note above, verſ. 2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the men of the garriſon anſwered Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and ſaid, Come up to us, and we will ſhew you a thing.]</hi> This they ſay by way of deriſion, as implying that they durſt not come up, or that if they did, they would give them their payment; but God intended it as a token adviſing Jonathan what he ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe the way where they went was ſo ſteep, that otherwiſe they could not have clambered up, and becauſe by this means they might the better ſhelter themſelves under the rocks, and ſo get up uneſpyed; for we muſt know that they went not up in the ordinary paſſage which was kept by the Philiſtines, but when they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered themſelves to the Philiſtines in that way, and the Philiſtines had in a ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing manner challenged them to come up, as is before noted, verſ. 11, 12. then they turned aſide and crept up on the ſharp rock above mentioned, verſ. 4. where the Philiſtines never dreamt of an enemies coming upon them, and ſo came upon them unawares. Had they climbed up in any place where the Philiſtines could have ſeen them, we may well think that they might eaſily have beaten them down; but they therefore wound about ſome other way, and clambering up on all foure (as we uſe to ſay) did ſhelter themſelves under the covert of thoſe craggy rocks, till they were gotten up in a place where the Philiſtines looked not for them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And there was trembling in the hoſt,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe words is ſhewn, whence it was that Jonathan and his armour-bearer ſhould ſo ſtrangely beat down the garriſon of the Philiſtines before them, and that preſently upon this, the whole army of the Philiſtines ſhould ſo eaſily be put to diſorder and flight; it was becauſe the Lord had ſtricken them all with a mighty terrour, <hi>there was trembling in the hoſt,</hi> &amp;c. not onely the garriſon was thus affrighted whom Jonathan at firſt aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but thoſe alſo in the camp, <hi>and the ſpoilers,</hi> to wit, thoſe mentioned before, chap. 13.17. <hi>they alſo trembled;</hi> all which too was helped forward with a terrible earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake that was ſent at the ſame time; <hi>the earth quaked,</hi> that is, that alſo was moved under them, and ſeemed as it were to quake for fear; which, I ſay, no doubt the Lord ſent, the more to terrifie and affright the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Saul ſaid unto Ahiah, Bring hither the Ark of God,</hi> &amp;c.] This he enjoyned, that Ahiah having put on the Ephod, might enquire of God what was the cauſe of that tumult in the camp of the Philiſtines, and what he ſhould do. Saul had already been a long time in great ſtraits; for all his ſouldiers except ſix hundred were gone away from him, the Philiſtines lay cloſe upon him with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty army, inſomuch that he durſt not ſtirre out of his trenches in Gibeah; and the enemy taking the advantage thereof, had ſent out three companies of ſpoilers to waſt and ſpoil the countrey round about; and yet all this while we reade no that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42229:143"/>
of God, though he had the Ark all this while with him. But now when his watchman had deſcried a tumult in the camp of the Philiſtines, and that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the abſence of his ſonne and his armour-bearer, that they were engaged amongſt them, and that it was probable by the relation of his watchman, that the Philiſtines were diſordered; now on a ſudden not knowing what he ſhould do, the Prieſt was called to enquire of God; and yet it was but a ſudden fit of devotion to which he was forced by his preſent diſtreſſe, as is evident by that which follows immediately in the next verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>The noiſe that was in the hoſt of the Philistines went on and increaſed; and Saul ſaid unto the Prieſt, Withdraw thine hand.]</hi> This did notably diſcover Sauls profaneneſſe; being at firſt perplexed and not knowing what to do, he called for the Ark to enquire of God; but preſently again perceiving by the increaſing noiſe and tumult in the camp of the Philiſtines, that ſome greivous diſaſter had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed befallen them, then away with the Ark, away with the Prieſt and his Ephod; Ahiah, ſaith he, <hi>withdraw thine hand,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Give over, it is no time now to ſtand conſulting and enquiring of God; the increaſing of the tumult ſheweth evidently enough what we have to do; we ſhall loſe an opportunity of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, which afterwards we may wiſh for when it is too late, and therefore muſt not now loſe time to ask counſel of God. And indeed, by the many ſad effects that accompanied the following victory, we may ſee how much God was diſpleaſed with this his profane contempt of the ordinance of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Moreover, the Hebrews that were with the Philiſtines, even they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo turned to be with the Iſraelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.]</hi> That is, their bondmen and ſervants; yea, and thoſe alſo that for fear were forced to come up with their carriages and proviſion, &amp;c. to the camp of the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the men of Iſrael were diſtreſſed that day.]</hi> Being weary through labour and toil, and ready to faint, they durſt not eat any thing becauſe of Sauls oath; and herein they were diſtreſſed. But if beſides they were hunger-bitten before, by reaſon of the ſpoiling bands of the Philiſtines, that kept all proviſions from them, this muſt needs make their miſery the greater.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Saul had adjured the people, ſaying, Curſed be the man that eateth any food untill evening.]</hi> That is, he had with an oath pronounced concerning the people, that he ſhould be accurſed, and as an accurſed thing ſhould be put to death, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was amongſt them that ſhould eat any thing untill the evening, as is evident by that ſentence pronounced againſt Jonathan, when he had onely taſted of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the wood, verſ. 44. <hi>And Saul anſwered, God do ſo, and more alſo; for thou ſhalt ſurely die Jonathan.</hi> The reaſon why Saul did this, was that the people might not looſe any time from purſuing the enemy. But the oath was raſh and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and like enough to have proceeded from a proud deſire to ſeem very zealous in the purſuing of theſe enemies, againſt whom erewhile he durſt not ſhew his head.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>He put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipt it in an hony-combe, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.]</hi> Being enfeebled with extreme labour and emptineſſe, his eyes waxed dimme, which now by this little refreſhing were enlightened again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>Then anſwered one of the people, and ſaid, Thy father ſtraitly charged
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42229:144"/>
the people with an oath,</hi> &amp;c.] That which is ſpoken with reference to any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done by another man, is called an anſwer in the Scripture phraſe, as well as that which is ſpoken with reference to ſomething before ſaid by another; ſo when Chriſt had whipped out thoſe that profaned the Temple, it is ſaid, Joh. 2.18 <hi>Then anſwered the Jews and ſaid unto him, What ſigne,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo it is here. Yet it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Jonathan encouraging the people in the purſuit of the enemy, one of the company returned him this anſwer, to ſhew the reaſon why the ſouldiers were faint and could not follow on.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And they ſmote the Philiſtines that day, from Michmaſh to Aijalon.]</hi> Which was in the tribe of Dan, Joſh. 19.42. and therefore not farre from the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines countrey: yet ſome hold that it was anothet Ajalon in the tribe of Judah, 2. Chron. 11.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>And the people flew upon the ſpoil, and took ſheep and oxen,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, when the evening was come, and the time prefixed by Saul expired; being then preſſed with extreme hunger through long faſting and labour, they greedily flew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpoyl, dreſſed and eat it, not ſtaying till it could be throughly cleanſed of the bloud, the life as it were yet panting in the fleſh, which was contrary to the Law, Deut. 12.16. <hi>Onely ye ſhall not eat the bloud, ye ſhall poure it upon the earth as water;</hi> and thus they that were ſo very carefull to obſerve the kings edict, never regarded the breach of Gods commandment.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And he ſaid, Ye have tranſgreſſed.]</hi> Or, <hi>Ye have dealt treacherouſly;</hi> Thus he was eager againſt the people for eating with the bloud, but never charged himſelf, who by a raſh vow had thus cauſed the people to ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roll a great ſtone unto me this day.]</hi> To wit, either that thereon in Sauls ſight they might kill and eat, to the end he might ſee them let the bloud run clearly out from the cattell they killed: or elſe, for the building of the Altar mentioned, verſ. 35. that they might kill and eat as it were in the preſence both of God and their king, that ſo he might be ſure to prevent their eating with the bloud any more.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And Saul built an altar unto the Lord.]</hi> To wit, either as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this his late victory, or rather that he might offer thereon gratulatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for that glorious victory which God had given them. And this is ſaid to be <hi>the firſt altar that he built unto the Lord;</hi> either becauſe thoſe altars in Gilgal and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, whereon he had formerly ſacrificed, were built by others before, and this was the firſt which he built himſelf, or elſe becauſe thoſe altars were onely ſet up for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent uſe, and then demoliſhed again; but this was the firſt which he built for a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continuing altar; which then is noted, becauſe it was directly againſt the law of God, as we may ſee in the notes, Exod. 20.24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>Then ſaid the Priests, Let us draw near hither unto God.]</hi> That is, let us enquire of God before the Ark: becauſe the proſecuting of the enemies by night, which Saul had motioned to the people, was an act of ſome danger, and the people were very forward to do what he adviſed, therefore the Prieſt interpoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and wiſhed them by all means to enquire firſt of the Lord; and this perhaps he did the rather, becauſe he ſaw what ill effects had followed upon Sauls neglecting to do this before, ver. 19. to wit, that Saul by a raſh and unadviſed oath had weakened the hands of the people in the purſuance of their victory, and had been withall the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42229:144"/>
occaſion of a grievous ſinne amongſt the people, which was their eating of the ſpoil with the bloud, verſ. 32.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>But he anſwered him not that day.]</hi> When Saul had enquired of the Lord by the judgement of Urim and Thummim, the Lord anſwered him not: but whence was this? doubtleſſe the Lords diſpleaſure was againſt Saul, not againſt Jonathan, who though he had done what his father had forbidden, and that with an oath, that whoſoever ſhould offend therein ſhould be accurſed, and ſo put to death; yet he did it ignorantly, not knowing that his father had made ſuch a vow, and was compelled too by neceſſity, being ready to faint when he reached out his rod, and ſo by taſting a little honey refreſhed himſelf: yet it is evident too, that the Lords refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to anſwer Saul tended to this, that it might be diſcovered that Jonathan had tranſgreſſed the command and vow of his father; but why? not ſo much to diſcover Jonathan to be the party with whom the Lord was offended; as firſt, to diſcover to Saul his hypocriſie, and the raſhneſſe of his unadviſed oath, who had hereby hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the victory, cauſed the people to ſinne, and now brought his own ſonne under the danger of being accurſed and put to death: and ſecondly, to ſhew the religious reſpect that was due to an oath.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>And Saul ſaid, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people; and know and ſee wherein this ſinne hath been this day.]</hi> Saul concluded that God was offended, when he had enquired of him by the Prieſt, and he would not anſwer him: and therefore preſently commanded <hi>all the chief of the people,</hi> that is, all the heads of the Tribes and families to draw near unto him, to wit, that by drawing lots it might be diſcovered who it was that had ſinned and offended God amongſt them: for though himſelf had ſinned in that raſh and unadviſed oath that he took, ver. 24. and and that he knew the people had ſinned grievouſly in eating with the bloud, verſ. 32. yet like a true hypocrite, he never minded theſe things, but concluded that the breach of his vow and command, muſt needs be the great offence which cauſed the Lord to be ſilent; and therefore for the finding out of this, he would have them draw lots.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>I did but taſt a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and lo I muſt die.]</hi> As if he had ſaid, That which I did was a very ſmall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if any, eſpecially conſidering that I knew not of the oath, and yet it ſeems I muſt die for it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 44. <hi>And Saul anſwered, God do ſo, and more alſo.]</hi> See the note Ruth. 1.17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 45. <hi>As the Lord liveth, there ſhall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.]</hi> That is, through Gods bleſſing and aſſiſtance, he hath been the means of procuring a moſt glorious victory to the children of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 47. <hi>So Saul took the kingdome over Iſrael, and fought againſt all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, being confirmed in his kingdome by this glorious victory over the Philiſtines, he again undertook the managing and adminiſtration of it; or elſe this may be ſpoken with reference to that which went before, to wit, that thus as we have heard he took upon him the kingdome, being choſen thereto of God, and in defence of the people fought againſt all their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 49. <hi>Now the ſonnes of Saul were Jonathan, and Iſhui,</hi> &amp;c.] This Iſhui is

                  <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>SAmuel alſo ſaid unto Saul, The Lord ſent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Iſrael.]</hi> That is, the Lord gave me commiſſion to anoint thee king (for Samuel went not to Saul, but Saul came to Samuel) and this Samuel premiſed, before he gave him the following charge from the Lord, that he ſhould go and deſtroy the Amalekites, that the remembrance of this honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God had exalted him, might make him the more carefull exactly to do what God had enjoyned him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now therefore hearken thou unto the voyce of the words of the Lord.]</hi> In this word <hi>(now)</hi> Samuel covertly puts him in mind of his former tranſgreſſion, chap. 13.8.9. As if he had ſaid, though thou didſt formerly neglect to do what the Lord enjoyned thee, yet now remember what God hath done for thee, and be ſure ſtrictly to obſerve this which God hath given thee in charge.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>I remember that which Amalek did to Iſrael, how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from Egypt.]</hi> Three ſeverall times God had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that he would deſtroy the Amalekites, and that for the violence which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Iſraelites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, Exod. 17.14. Numb. 24.20. and Deut. 25.19. And now Saul is ſent to execute that vengeance upon them, which the Lord had ſo long time ſince at ſeverall times threatned: for though the preſent king and people of Amalek had been cruell and bloudy adverſaries to the people of God, as Samuels ſpeech to Agag ſeems to imply, verſ. 33. <hi>As thy ſword hath made women childleſſe, ſo ſhall thy mother be childleſſe among women;</hi> and ſo had deſerved to be deſtroyed for their own ſinnes; yet becauſe the Lord would have his people know that he had not forgot that former injurie of their Anceſtours towards his people, though it were now above foure hundred years ſince; but intended now principally to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on them for that, in the commiſſion that he ſent now to Saul for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of the Amalekites, he mentions no other cauſe but that wrong which of old their fathers had done to his people, expreſſing one circumſtance as a great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their crueltie; namely, that when his poore people had been ſo long under a miſerable bondage in Egypt, and were now newly eſcaped thence, then they came preſently out againſt them, and ſought to deſtroy them. <hi>I remember,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>that which Amalek did to Iſrael when he came up from Egypt.</hi> Nor need it ſeem ſtrange that the preſent Amalekites ſhould be utterly deſtroyed, for that which their Anceſtours had done ſo many years ago; for though God deſtroyes none everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but for their own ſinnes, yet with temporall puniſhments he doth uſually puniſh the children for the ſinnes of their Anceſtours; eſpecially when the children go in their fathers ſteps, as by that which is ſaid of Agag verſ. 33. it ſeems theſe did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Now go, and ſmite Amalek, and utterly deſtroy all that they have.]</hi>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:42229:145"/>
That is, not the men and cattell onely, as is afterward expreſſed, but their cities alſo, and all the wealth therein, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 4. <hi>And Saul gathered the people together, and numbred them in Telaim.]</hi> Which moſt Expoſitours conceive to be the city of Judah called Telem, Joſh. 15.24. As for the following clauſe wherein thoſe of Judah are numbred apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>two hundred thouſand footmen, and ten thouſand men of Judah,</hi> ſee the note upon chap. 11.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.]</hi> The inſerting of this here ſeems to imply, that either it was the firſt city he came to, or that it was the city where their king was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And Saul ſaid unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get ye down from among the Amalekites,</hi> &amp;c.] This muſt be meant either of the poſterity of Jethro the Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, who though they had planted themſelves in the tribe of Judah, Judg. 1.16. yet now happely they were removed further, becauſe of the Iſraelites warres, into the land of the Amalekites (for they dwelt in Tents, Judg. 4.17. and therefore might eaſily remove from one place to another:) or elſe it is meant of a people ſo called of whom Jethro was, Numb. 24.21. who are now ſpared for Jethro's ſake. Yet his redoubling the charge that they ſhould get them away, in thoſe ſeverall terms, <hi>Go, depart,</hi> was to imply, that if they loved their lives they ſhould make haſte away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For ye ſhewed kindneſſe to all the children of Iſrael, when they came up out of Egypt.]</hi> This is queſtionleſſe meant of the kindneſſe which Jethro the Kenite and his family ſhewed to the Iſraelites. He came out with much joy to meet Moſes, and to congratulate all the goodneſſe which God had ſhewn to the Iſraelites: he gave him counſell for the well-ordering of the government of Iſrael; and doubtleſſe, he and his were eyes unto the Iſraelites in their going through the wilderneſſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Moſes deſire, Numb. 10.31. And therefore now Saul gave them warning to remove away, that they might not ſuffer together with the Amalekites. As the Lord puniſhed the Amalekites for the wrong their Progenitours did to his people, ſo he ſpared the Kenites for the kindneſſe their Anceſtours had ſhown them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And Saul ſmote the Amalekites, from Havilah, untill thou comeſt to Shur, that is over against Egypt.]</hi> That Saul deſtroyed not all the whole nation of the Amalekites, is evident, chap. 27.8. <hi>And David and his men went up, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Geſhurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites.</hi> And chap. 30.1. <hi>And it came to paſſe, when David was come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded Ziklag,</hi> &amp;c. Either therefore this muſt be meant of ſome one part of their countrey; or that Saul ſlew throughout the land all that he could get into his power; for Shur is the furtheſt border of their land towards Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all the people,</hi> &amp;c.] Agag was the common name of the kings of that land, Numb. 24.7. <hi>And his king ſhall be higher then Agag,</hi> &amp;c. Now this Agag whom above the reſt he ſhould have ſlain, Saul ſpared, either to make his triumph more glorious, which he might think would be moſt for Gods glory; or out of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to get a great ranſome for him: or rather out of a fooliſh pitty, becauſe he was a king: and indeed the confidence of Saul in his anſwer to Samuel, verſ. 20.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42229:146"/>
                     <hi>Yea, I have obeyed the voyce of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord ſent me. And have brought Agag the king of Amalek,</hi> &amp;c. makes it not very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that in ſparing Agag, he thought he had done well.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the beſt of the ſheep, and of the oxen,</hi> &amp;c.] In ſparing theſe cattell, they pretended a reſpect they had to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; namely, that they ſpared them for ſacrifice, as Saul told Samuel after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, verſ. 15. <hi>The people ſpared the beſt of the ſheep, and of the oxen, to ſacrifice unto the Lord.</hi> Whereas indeed it is moſt probable, that ſecretly they had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to retain many of them for their own uſe; as thoſe words of Samuel ſeem to imply, verſ. 19. <hi>Wherefore didst thou not obey the voyce of the Lord, but didſt fly upon the ſpoyl?</hi> However, when God had injoyned them to deſtroy all the cattell, and not to ſpare any, for them to <hi>ſpare all that was good,</hi> and to deſtroy thoſe onely that were <hi>vile and refuſe,</hi> as it follows in this verſe, was all one in effect as if they had reſolved, that in thoſe that were worth nothing God ſhould have his deſire, but that thoſe that were fat and good, they knew how to reſerve for a better uſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>It repenteth me, that I have ſet up Saul to be king.]</hi> See the note up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gen. 6.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Saul came to Carmel, and Behold, he ſet him up a place, and is gone about,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he pitched their Tents in Carmell, and ſo ſtayed there a while to refreſh his army, and divide the ſpoil, and then went away to Gilgal: or elſe the meaning may be this, he ſet him up a place in Carmel, that is, ſome Pillar or Piramides, as a triumphant monument of his victory, and ſo went thence away to Gilgal.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Saul ſaid unto him, Bleſſed be thou of the Lord; I have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the commandment of the Lord.]</hi> This confident boaſting of Saul may ſeem to imply, that he did think indeed that he had performed what God injoyned him, as not thinking that his ſparing of Agag, and ſome of the cattell for ſacrifices, would have been judged a tranſgreſſion of Gods command; but yet others conceive, that his own conſcience told him that he had not done well; and that thence it was, that now at his meeting with Samuel, he ſaluted him in ſuch a fawning manner, as by way of colloging with him; <hi>Bleſſed be thou of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>For the people ſpared the best of the ſheep, and of the oxen to ſacrifice to the Lord thy God.]</hi> It is evident that he conſented at leaſt, to the ſparing of thoſe cattell they had brought from the Amalekites; for ſo it is expreſſely ſaid before, verſ. 9. <hi>But Saul and the people ſpared Agag, and the beſt of the ſheep,</hi> &amp;c. And yet now to excuſe himſelf, he would make Samuel believe, that if this were a fault, it was not he but the people that had herein tranſgreſſed; onely withall he alledgeth in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the people, that they had ſpared them onely for ſacrifices, which he hoped Samuel could not but approve; and to make this take the better with Samuel, he ſaith not onely that they were to be ſacrificed to the Lord, but <hi>to the Lord thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Then Samuel ſaid unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath ſaid to me this night. And he ſaid, Say on.]</hi> As happely expecting ſome good meſſage: ſo farre doth hypocriſie blind men, even when they have done that which is notoriouſly evil.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Go and utterly deſtroy the ſinners the Amalekites.]</hi> That is, thoſe
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42229:146"/>
wicked wretches the Amalekites ſinners, above others; ſo the word <hi>ſinners</hi> is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where uſed, Gen. 13.13. and Matth. 19.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>For rebellion is as the ſinne of witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſſe is as ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and idolatry.]</hi> All unrighteouſneſſe and ſinne is in the Scripture termed <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> as Gen. 15.16. <hi>For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</hi> And Rom. 4.7. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven,</hi> &amp;c. But in this ſenſe how ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe may be ſaid to be <hi>as iniquity,</hi> is not eaſie to conceive. And therefore here by <hi>iniquity</hi> many Expoſitours underſtand the aberration of men from the right rule of Gods worſhip (and therefore it is joyned here with idolatry) and is by many tranſlated ſuperſtition, <hi>ſtubbornneſſe is as ſuperſtition and idolatry.</hi> But why doth Samuel ſay (and that doubtleſſe in relation to Sauls ſinne) that <hi>Rebellion is as the ſinne of witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſſe is as iniquity and idolatry?</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, ſome take it to be ſpoken onely comparatively, that rebellion and ſtubbornneſſe are as great ſinnes, and as hatefull to God as witchcraft and idolatry. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, others ſay, that the drift of theſe words is to ſhew, that rebellion and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are ſinnes much of the ſame nature as are witchcraft and Idolatry. Becauſe as witches and idolatours do give away the glory of God to a poore creature, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the creature above God; ſo they that have an expreſſe command from God for doing of any thing, &amp; will then conſult with their own reaſon, whether they ſhall do it or no, and will ſtubbornly and rebelliouſly do contrary to what God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, merely out of a conceit that they judge it better to do otherwiſe; then they do as manifeſtly give away the glory of God to a baſe creature, exalt the creature above God, as witches and idolatours do. But thirdly, others (and I think upon the beſt grounds) do conceive the intention of theſe words to be onely this, That an act of rebellion againſt any command of God (though had it not been for that command of God, it would not have been otherwiſe unlawfull,) is as manifeſtly a ſinne, and may be in its degree as hatefull to God, as thoſe ſinnes are that are againſt the law and light of nature, and contrary to the truth and glory of Gods nature and eſſence, ſuch as witchcraft and idolatry are: Such was this act of Sauls in ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Agag, and the beſt of the cattell. There would have been no evil in it, had not God commanded them to be deſtroyed: But being done ſo expreſſely againſt the command of God, it was no leſſe then rebellion, and in that regard hatefull to God as well as witchcraft and idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And Saul ſaid unto Samuel, I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus Saul at laſt confeſſed his ſinne, but hypocritically, not ſincerely; not becauſe he was at all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for what he had done, but onely becauſe he deſired by this means to pacifie Samuel, and to ſee if he might revoke the ſentence pronounced againſt him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the loſſe of his kingdome: All which is evident in the following clauſe, wherein he ſeeks to excuſe, or at leaſt to extenuate his offence, by pretending that he did it for fear of the people, which true penitents are not wont to do, <hi>I have tranſgreſſed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the commandment of the Lord, and thy words, becauſe I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my ſinne, and turn again with me, that I may worſhip the Lord.] Pardon my ſinne,</hi> that is, do thou forgive the ſinne I have committed, and effect my reconciliation with God, <hi>And turn again with me,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42229:147"/>
that I may worſhip the Lord,</hi> to wit, both by way of thankfulneſſe for the Lords fighting for them againſt the Amalekites, and alſo to ſeek to God for the pardon of this ſinne they had runne into.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And Samuel ſaid unto Saul, I will not return with thee.]</hi> To wit, for fear he ſhould ſeem any way to allow or approve of that which he had done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.]</hi> He catched hold of the skirt of his mantle, as being wondrous loth to have the people take any notice of Samuels and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Lords diſpleaſure againſt him. But the rending of the skirt of his mantle, was of God as a ſigne that the kingdome ſhould be rent away from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſ. 28. <hi>And Samuel ſaid unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdome from thee this day.</hi> And the Hebrews adde, that it was alſo to ſhew, that the man that ſhould hereafter tear off the skirt of his garment, ſhould be the man that ſhould ſucceed him in the throne, and that hence was that which Saul ſaid then, chap. 24.20. <hi>And now behold, I know well that thou ſhalt ſurely be king, and that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael ſhall be eſtabliſhed in thine hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And alſo the ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie nor repent, for he is not a man that he ſhould repent.]</hi> This laſt clauſe is added, becauſe men are ſo prone naturally to meaſure God by themſelves. The greateſt difficulty in theſe words is, why Samuel affirming this of God, terms him <hi>the ſtrength of Iſrael;</hi> of which theſe reaſons may be given, to wit, firſt, That it was to imply the immutabilitie of God; for as the mutabilitie of man proceeds from mans weakneſſe, whence it is that the weaker men are, the more irreſolute and changeable they are; ſo the immutability of God argues Gods ſtrength. Secondly, It was to imply how unreſiſtably able God was to effect what he had ſaid concerning the removing of the kingdome from Saul to David: Saul might hope to ſettle the kingdome upon his poſterity, but the ſtrength of Iſrael had decreed otherwiſe, and he would not lie nor repent, as being almighty and therefore able to do whatever he pleaſed: in deſpite of all that Saul ſhould do againſt David, the kingdome ſhould be taken from him and given to David. And thirdly, It might be to anſwer an objection that might ariſe in Sauls mind: Saul might think that ſurely the Lord would not indeed take away the kingdome from him, becauſe the Lord himſelf had ſaid, that he ſhould ſave Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael out of the hands of the Philiſtines, chap. 9.16. To beat him from this refuge, Samuel puts him in mind that God was the ſtrength of his people, and ſo could ſave and deliver them, and yet make good his word in removing him from being king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>Then he ſaid, I have ſinned.]</hi> See the note, verſ. 24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>So Samuel turned again after Saul,</hi> &amp;c.] Though he had formerly refuſed to go with Saul, to wit, at that time, and that upon this ground, that he might not ſeem to allow of Sauls ſinne; yet now upon another ground he yields to go, to wit, that the people might not take any occaſion of not yielding to Saul that honour which was yet due to him as the anointed of the Lord; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he intended to take away the offence of ſeeming to allow Sauls ſinne, by executing Gods ſentence upon Agag whom Saul had ſpared.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>And Agag came unto him delicately.]</hi> That is, in the attire, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42229:147"/>
with the geſture and gate of a king, as one that thought not of death, but onely took care that both his apparell and every thing elſe about him, yea his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and carriage of himſelf ſhould be Prince-like, and ſuch as beſeemed the dignity of his perſon though now a captive. Becauſe he was brought not to Saul the king that had taken him priſoner, but to Samuel an aged prophet, this it may be made him ſo confident, that now the danger of death was over; now (thinks he with himſelf) <hi>Surely the bitterneſſe of death is paſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.]</hi> Whether Samuel did this by himſelf or by others, he did it doubtleſſe by the ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And Samuel came to ſee Saul no more untill the day of his death.]</hi> That is, he never went after this to viſit him, as formerly to give him inſtruction and direction in his affairs. For that Samuel did before his death ſee Saul after this, is evident chap. 19.24. <hi>And he ſtript off his clothes alſo, and propheſied before Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel in like manner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the Lord ſaid unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, ſeeing I have rejected him from reigning over Iſrael?]</hi> That it was a ſinne in Samuel to mourn for Saul, when God had rejected him from being king, we cannot ſay; for it is a work of charity well-pleaſing to God, to mourn for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men that lie under Gods wrath, and yet mourn not for themſelves; eſpecially in Gods Prophets and Meſſengers, whoſe duty it is to interpoſe themſelves when God is angry with his people, &amp; by their prayers and tears to ſue for mercy for them. And therefore we ſee the Lord complains of theſe prophets, Ezek. 13.5. that had not <hi>gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the houſe of Iſrael, to ſtand in the battell in the day of the Lord.</hi> And beſides, Samuel might well fear, that if Saul were cut off, a great deal of trouble and confuſion might happen amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In which caſe he had juſt cauſe to mourn in their behalf. And why then did the Lord expoſtulate with Samuel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>How long wilt thou mourn for Saul?</hi> &amp;c. Surely, to make known to Samuel, that all his mourning for Saul was in vain, partly becauſe he continued ſtill obſtinate and impenitent, and partly becauſe God had abſolutely rejected him from being king. In which caſe though Samuel might bewail Sauls condition (for all mourning for that which we know God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed is not unlawfull; when we looſe deare friends, we know it is Gods will, and yet may mourn for their death) yet he might not bewail it ſo as might imply an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to ſubmit to the will of God; and therefore we ſee it is not for his mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but for his mourning ſo long, that God expoſtulates with him, <hi>How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, ſeeing I have rejected him from being king.</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42229:148"/>
he would have him anointed before-hand that was to ſucceed Saul. 1. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Samuel and others, that knew the Lord had forſaken and caſt off Saul; who by this might be aſſured, that for all this God intended not to caſt off the care of his people. 2. That David being anointed, when he was in the eye of reaſon ſo unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come to the Crown, it might be the more evident when it came to paſſe, that it was of God. 3. That hereby David might be ſupported in his many following troubles. And 4. That the ſame hand that had anointed Saul, might teſtifie Gods rejecting Sauls poſterity, by anointing one of another family, to ſucceed him in the throne: for Samuel drawing now to his end, had therefore this buſineſſe now impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon him, and was ſent to <hi>Jeſſe the Bethlehemite,</hi> who was the ſonne of Obed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and grandchild of Boaz and Ruth, the Lord making known to him, that one of his ſonnes was to be anointed king. The expreſſion the Lord uſeth in making this known to Samuel, is very obſervable, becauſe it implies that the king that was now to be anointed, was in a peculiar manner the Lords king: <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided me a king among his ſonnes.</hi> Saul was choſen by the Lord to be the king of Iſrael, but it was upon the importunity of the people, who would needs have it ſo, and could not be beaten off from it; ſo that Saul was the peoples king rather then Gods, given them becauſe of the peoples prepoſterous and unruly deſires, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his government being abortive, continued not, nor thrived well for the beſt things whileſt it did continue: but how when David was anointed king, there was no ſuch matter, but he was merely choſen of God, there was no body deſired, or ſpake the leaſt word for the erecting of his government; yea, even Samuel himſelf by his deſire after Saul, and mourning for him, did unwittingly what he could to oppoſe the advancing of David; onely God did then of his own freewill, when no body thought any thing of it, ſend Samuel to anoint David; and ſo he was a king of Gods own providing, the king in whoſe ſeed the kingdome was to be eſtabliſhed, Gen. 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his feet, untill Shiloh come;</hi> and who would in his government carefully perform the will of God, chap. 13.14. <hi>The Lord hath ſought him a man after his own heart.</hi> And indeed in all theſe things David was a notable type of Chriſt: for firſt, he was the <hi>Sonne of David,</hi> Matth. 1.1. and <hi>the king of Iſrael,</hi> Joh. 1.49. upon whom the kingdome was ſettled for ever, Luke 1.33. <hi>And he ſhall reigne over the houſe of Iſrael for ever, and of his kingdome there ſhall be no end:</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was given of God to be the king of his Church, that he might ſave them out of the hands of their enemies when no man deſired it; when we thought not of any ſuch mercy, nor begged it of God, he of his own free grace gave us his ſonne to be our king. <hi>I have ſet my king upon my holy hill of Sion,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Pſal. 2.6. <hi>Thou hast loved righteouſneſſe and hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſſe above thy fellows,</hi> Heb. 1.9. and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he doth adminiſter this kingdome according to Gods own heart: Pſal 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7 8. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy Law is within my heart:</hi> which the Apoſtle doth plainly apply to Chriſt, Heb. 10.6, 7. So that beſides the reaſons formerly given, why the Lord appointed the kings of Iſrael to be anointed with oyl, chap. 10.1. this alſo may be added concerning David and his poſterity, to wit, that they were
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42229:148"/>
anointed to ſhadow forth that there was a Meſſiah to come, whom God had anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be king over his Church, even the Lord Chriſt, upon whom the Spirit of God, and the true oyl of anointing, was poured forth without meaſure; whence it was that Chriſt did apply to himſelf that propheſie, Iſa. 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 14.18. It is much argued amongſt expoſitours, whether David and ſo his poſterity alſo, if not all the kings of Iſrael too, were not anointed with the holy oyl of the Tabernacle wherewith the Preiſts were anointed: and there are many, who though they think it altogether improbable, that the Prophets would uſe the ſacred oyl of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle in anointing the idolatrous kings of Iſrael, yet they hold that David and his ſucceſſours were anointed with that oyl: firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it is ſaid, that David was anointed with <hi>holy oyle,</hi> Pſal. 89.20. <hi>I have found David my ſervant, with my holy oyl have I anointed him.</hi> And ſecondly, becauſe it is expreſſely ſaid of Solomon, 1. King. 1.39. that <hi>Zadok took an horn of oyl out of the Tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.</hi> But now on the other ſide, firſt, becauſe that Law of the Preiſts oyl, Exod. 30.32. ſeems to imply, that it was not to be uſed for any other but the Prieſts onely: ſecondly, becauſe we find no command that this ſervice ſhould be performed with that ſacred oyl; and thirdly, becauſe when David was anointed the ſecond time by the men of Judah, 2. Sam. 2.4. the Tabernacle was then at Gibeon, &amp; that was under the power of Iſhboſheth the ſonne of Saul, and ſo David could not then be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed with that oyl of the Tabernacle; therefore it is judged moſt probable by many other Expoſitours, that neither David nor Solomon were anointed with that oyl; but, ſay they, becauſe the office and imployment of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, who ſits in Gods ſeat, and executes Gods judgements, may be called holy, as the Seat of Juſtice is called <hi>the holy place,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.10. therefore it is ſaid that David was anointed with holy oyl. And for that place 1. Kings 1.39. they anſwer, that it may well be that this horn of oyl wherewith Samuel was now ſent to anoint David, was afterwards laid up in the Tabernacle, and ſo Solomon was anointed therewith. But however, there was much oyl in the Tabernacle, beſides that which was made for the Prieſts anointing, which Zadok might take thence for the anointing of Solomon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And Samuel ſaid, How can I go? If Saul heare it, he will kill me.]</hi> This queſtion might well proceed both from a fearfull apprehenſion of the danger of this act, &amp; a deſire to be inſtructed, how with leaſt danger this buſineſſe might be carried.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Take an heifer with thee, and ſay, I am come to ſacrifice unto the Lord.]</hi> Thus the Lord adviſed him to conceal the principall cauſe of his coming, and to alledge onely that buſineſſe which he had to do there, that might be ſafely made known; which was not unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And call Jeſſe to the ſacrifice,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, invite him to the feaſt thou makeſt with thy peace-offerings.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the Elders of the town trembled at his coming,</hi> &amp;c.] Bethlehem was but a little obſcure town, Micah 5.2. <hi>And thou Bethlehem-Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah,</hi> &amp;c. Either therefore becauſe it was ſuch news to ſee Samuel there, they feared he came, as a Prophet, with ſome heavy meſſage of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them; or elſe, becauſe he came ſo unexpectedly,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42229:149"/>
and withall ſo privately, and without attendance; they feared he had fled from Saul (as having happely heard of that which had paſſed betwixt him and the king, related in the former chapter) and ſo were troubled for him: and withall perhaps afraid, leſt Saul ſhould be enraged againſt them for entertaining him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And he ſanctified Jeſſe and his ſonnes, and called them to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.]</hi> That is, he appointed them to prepare and ſanctifie themſelves both legally and ſpiritually, that they might eat of the ſacrifices. See the note on Joſh. 3.5.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And it came to paſſe when they were come, that he looked on Eliab,</hi> &amp;c.] Somewhat is here left to be ſuppoſed, as neceſſarily following upon that which is expreſſed, to wit, that Samuel had acquainted Jeſſe with the cauſe of his coming: and that hereupon Jeſſe brought in his ſonnes one by one into ſome private place, whither before they ſat down to eat of the ſacrifice, they had retired themſelves for that purpoſe, that he might be anointed whom God had choſen: and ſo when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel beheld Eliab the firſt-born, he ſaid to himſelf, Surely this is the man: The comelineſſe of his perſon made him think, this was he whom God had choſen: but herein he was led by his own ſpirit: as Nathan in a like caſe was, when he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged David to build a Temple, 2. Sam. 7.3. <hi>And Nathan ſaid to the King, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for the Lord is with thee:</hi> and hereby it was the more manifeſt, that it was not Samuel, but God that choſe David to be King.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then Jeſſe made Shammah to paſſe by.]</hi> Called alſo Shumma, 1. Chron. 2.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Again Jeſſe made ſeven of his ſonnes, to paſſe before Samuel.]</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is manifeſt that Jeſſe had eight ſonnes, as it is alſo expreſſed chap. 17.12. <hi>Now David was the ſonne of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem-Judah, whoſe name was Jeſſe, and he had eight ſonnes,</hi> &amp;c. though there be but ſeven mentioned, 1. Chron. 2.13, 14, 15. becauſe happely one of theſe died immediately after this; and onely thoſe are mentioned there, that were men of fame in after-times: for it hath no probability in it which ſome ſay, that he had amongſt theſe brought one of his grandchildren to Samuel, ſince we ſee that as yet he had not brought David his youngeſt ſonne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Samuel ſaid unto Jeſſe, Are here all thy children?]</hi> Jeſſe had omitted to bring his youngeſt ſonne, as concluding that it could not be he of all the reſt whom God had choſen; which was doubtleſſe ſo ordered by the ſpeciall providence of God, that Samuel being brought to this demurre, it might be the more evident that David was truely choſen of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Then Samuel took the horn of oyl, and anointed him in the midſt of his brethren.]</hi> That is, amongſt all the ſonnes of Jeſſe, Samuel by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anointed David, from amongſt the reſt of his brethren he was taken and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed to ſucceed Saul in the kingdome. The phraſe is not unlike that, Deut. 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning is not therefore, that his brethren ſtood about him
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42229:149"/>
when he was anointed: For though it be evident that Samuel acquainted Jeſſe with that which God had commanded him to do, and that he was an eye-witneſſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids anointing; yet it is not likely that his brethren ſtood by, and looked on when this was done, and heard what Samuel ſaid unto him; who no doubt made it known to David why he anointed him, as may ſeem to be implyed in that place, 2. Sam, 5.2. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to thee, Thou ſhalt feed my people Iſrael, and ſhalt be a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over Iſrael:</hi> For firſt, though Jeſſe might be enjoyned ſecreſie, yet it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that his envious brethren, ſeeing him anointed by Samuel that famous Prophet, ſhould either not ſuſpect any thing thereby, or not blazon it abroad. And to what end was Samuel ſent ſo ſecretly, under the colour of a ſolemne ſacrifice, if David were to be anointed ſo openly, amongſt ſo many witneſſes that might publiſh it wheree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they came? &amp; ſecondly, how can we think that Davids brethren (had they known of Samuels anointing him) would have uſed him ſo ſcornfully as after this they did; chap. 17.28. <hi>And Eliab his eldeſt brother heard when he ſpake unto the men, and Eliabs anger was kindled against David, and he ſaid, Why cameſt thou down hither? and with whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep in the wilderneſſe? I know thy pride and the naughtineſſe of thine heart, &amp;c.</hi> Surely they would never have uſed him with ſuch ſcorn, had they known he was anointed by Samuel, yea though we ſhould ſuppoſe what ſome affirm, that they imagined that he was anointed to be a Prophet, not a King: Many Expoſitours indeed anſwer, that either they underſtood not, or believed not Gods purpoſe in the anointing of David: But Samuel was a prophet of ſuch fame in thoſe dayes, that me thinks ſuch a ſolemne action of his ſhould not ſo be ſleighted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.]</hi> That is, the Lord gave him an extraordinary meaſure of the gifts and graces of his holy ſpirit, whereof his anointing was an outward ſigne: and ſo he was moved and led on by the ſpirit of God, to undertake great and noble enterpriſes, ſuch as was that of his killing the lion and the bear, mentioned in the following chapter, verſ. 34, 35, 36. Whence it was that he became ſo famous, that Sauls Courtiers could ſay of him, verſ. 18. that he was <hi>a mighty valiant man, and a man of warre, and prudent in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Yea, and beſides it may well be, that from that time forward he had alſo a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prophecy, and the gift of Poetry and Muſick conferred upon him, wherein he became afterward exceeding eminent.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil ſpirit from the Lord troubled him.]</hi> That is, the Lord bereaved him of thoſe gifts he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly beſtowed upon him, and then by degrees he began to be troubled with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly and frantick fits, as is evident, chap. 28.10.11. And that by means of an evil ſpirit ſent from God (for even the devils ſtirre not without Gods allowance.) Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he was tormented with the terrours of an evil and guilty conſcience; &amp; oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with grief and ſadneſſe of heart for the loſſe of his kingdome; and then Sathan making uſe of this diſtemper both of body and mind, drove him into fits of phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and rage, that he was for the time as one poſſeſſed with a devil. He had preferred his own reaſon before Gods directions in the buſineſſe of the Amalekites, and ſo made an idole of his own wiſdom and reaſon; and now God deprives him of the uſe of his reaſon, and brake (as it were) this his idole in pieces.</p>

And indeed, ſo as they ſaid it fell out, verſ. 23. <hi>And it came to paſſe, when the evil ſpirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand; ſo Saul was refreſhed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him:</hi> yet not ſo much I conceive through the virtue or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power of muſick, as by the ſpeciall hand of God, who was pleaſed extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to cauſe it thus to work upon Saul: however, herein we may well look upon David as a type of Chriſt who caſt out many devils out of men poſſeſſed; and now by the glad tidings of the Goſpel, doth daily caſt them out of the hearts of naturall men, and quiets thoſe ſouls that are diſtempered with greif or fear: working peace unſpeakable in thoſe that lie under the greateſt terrours of conſcience by reaſon of ſinne.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>NOw the Philistines gathered together their armies to battell, and were gathered together at Shochoh,</hi> &amp;c.] Shochoh was a city of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, as we ſee Joſh. 15.35. where alſo, as here, Azekah is mentioned as a town not farre from Shochoh: it is not expreſſed what moved the Philiſtines again to invade the land of Iſrael; but by other paſſages of the ſtory of theſe times, we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conceive that it was, firſt, a deſire to revenge their former ſhamefull loſſe, when Jonathan and his armour-bearer put their whole army to flight, chap 14. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a jealouſie of their increaſing power, through many victories by Saul ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt his other neighbours, chap. 14.47. <hi>So Saul took the kingdome over
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42229:150"/>
Iſrael, and fought againſt all his enemies on every ſide; againſt Moab, and againſt the children of Ammon, and againſt Edom, and againſt the king of Zobah, and againſt the Philiſtines, and whither ſoever he turned himſelf he vexed them:</hi> and thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some intelligence that might be given them of Sauls diſtemper and frantick fits, which they hoped would be no little advantage to them. But indeed the chief reaſon was, becauſe that God ſtirred them up to accompliſh that which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the Philiſtines ſtood on a mountain on the one ſide, and Iſrael on a mountain on the other ſide.]</hi> Thus each part kept their ground of advantage for a time, not joyning in groſſe, but maintaining ſome skirmiſhes onely, as appeareth, verſ. 20.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philiſtines, named Goliath of Gath.]</hi> See Joſh. 11.22. We reade alſo of a brother of his that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a mighty Gyant, 1. Chron. 20 5. <hi>And Elhanan the ſonne of Jair ſlew Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Hittite, whoſe ſpear-staffe was like a Weavers beam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the weight of the coat was five thouſand ſhekels of braſſe.]</hi> To wit an hundred fifty ſix pound foure ounces or thereabout.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And one bearing a ſhield went before him.]</hi> This ſhield Goliath was to uſe when he came to fight, but in the mean ſeaſon for the greater ſtate, he had his Armour-bearer to carry it before him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Why are you come out to ſet your battell in array.]</hi> That is, what need we bring a whole Army on each ſide to fight it out? Let us caſt all upon a ſingle combat. It is like enough the remembrance of their former loſſe, chap. 14. made them ſomewhat backward to put it to a battle, and their confidence in this Goliath, made them willing to decide all by a ſingle fight. I (ſaith he) am a Philiſtine, <hi>and you ſervants to Saul.</hi> (The expreſſion is obſervable, not Iſraelites, but <hi>ſervants to Saul</hi> by way of contempt) And therefore do you chooſe out a man from amongſt you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let us two decide the controverſie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>When Saul and all Iſrael heard th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe words of the Philiſtine, they were diſmaid, and greatly afraid.]</hi> They could not but know that God was able to lay the huge bulk of this Gyant under the feet of the meaneſt of them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides as they had a promiſe from God, that one of them ſhould chaſe a thouſand of their enemies; ſo likewiſe God had lately made good his promiſe in the late routing of the whole Army of the Philiſtines, by Jonathan and his Armour-bearer, chap. 14. And therefore it may ſeem ſtrange that all their hearts ſhould tremble thus, and be ſo out-braved by this Infidell monſter: eſpecially if we conſider that Jonathan was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as it is evident he was, becauſe after that David had ſlain Goliath, it is ſaid that Jonathan ſtood by, and heard his father talking with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chap. 18.1.) For that he alſo ſhould be afraid to enter the liſts with Goliath, who had ſo often fought the Lords battell with great courage, and had of late ſo miraculouſly put the whole Army of the Philiſtines to flight, is indeed a matter of much wonder. But for this we muſt conſider, that both faith and courage are the gifts of God, which when he with-holdeth, the beſt, even thoſe that are at other times as bold as a Lion, may ſhrink for fear. God meant now to magnifie David, and therefore he left even Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan himſelf to the feebleneſſe of his own ſpirit, that David might undertake what
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42229:151"/>
none durſt venture upon, and ſo might become famous amongſt the Iſrael of God, not a man was found that durſt accept of Goliaths challenge which he propounded twice a day, morning and evening, verſ. 16. For forty dayes together, no not after Saul had proclaimed in the camp great rewards, yea even his own daughter in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to him that would undertake it; all which rendred Davids courage and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the more glorious.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Now David was the ſonne of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whoſe name was Jeſſe, and he had eight ſonnes.]</hi> See the note upon chap. 16.10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the man went among men for an old man in the dayes of Saul.]</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though his ſonnes followed Saul to the warre, yet he ſtayed at home.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>But David went and returned from Saul to feed his fathers ſheep at Bethlehem.]</hi> That we may not wonder how David was ſent to the camp by his father Jeſſe, when it was ſaid in the former chapter, that he was in Sauls Court, and made his Armour bearer: here we are told that he had before this time left the Court, and was returned to keep his fathers ſheep; the reaſon whereof might be either, firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the alienation of Sauls affection that he began little to regard him, and ſo Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was deſirous to return to his own home, (we know brain-ſick men are uſually unconſtant, and ſeldome continue long in one mind) or ſecondly becauſe Saul being for a time recovered of his frantick fits, he had no more need of Davids muſick, and thereupon diſmiſſed him (and happely indeed his mind being wholly taken up with this war with the Philiſtines, he was not ſo much diſquieted with thoſe corroding jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and fears, that had formerly vexed and troubled his ſpirit) or thirdly, becauſe Jeſſe having ſent his three eldeſt ſonnes to the warre; Saul was pleaſed to ſend David home, that he might be a comfort to his aged father. But however this diſpenſation of Gods providence in thus diſpoſing of David is very obſervable: for firſt, by this means David even after he was anointed to be king of Iſrael, continued a while in a mean and obſcure condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> keeping his fathers ſheep in Bethlehem, <hi>and following the ewes great with young,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, Pſal. 78.71. And herein was he a notable type of Chriſt, who at firſt lived in the form of a ſervant, and became of no reputation, being eſteemed the ſonne of a carpenter, born in a ſtable, deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected amongſt thoſe with whom he converſed, though God had even then given him the Throne of his father David, Luk 1.32. Secondly, hereby was the faith of David concerning Samuels anointing him notably tried; when David was called to the Court to play upon his harp before Saul, and was made his Armour bearer, there ſeemed to be ſome little ground of hope, that God was then making way to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed exaltation. But when afterwards he was ſent back again to keep his fathers ſheep, then that little ſpark of hope that appeared before, was ſuddenly quenched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: To which David notwithſtanding did willingly ſtoop, and was contented to wait upon God for the accompliſhment of that which he had promiſed. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hereby the Lords effecting that which he had purpoſed without the help of man, was the more wonderfully manifeſted. One would have thought that Jeſſe, who knew of Davids anointing, ſhould have ſent David to the warre above all the reſt of his ſonnes, in hope that thereby ſome paſſage might have been opened to him for his expected exaltation: But Jeſſe never minding any ſuch thing, but keeping him at home with his ſheep, and onely caſually as it were, ſending him to enquire of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42229:151"/>
welfare of his brethren; the Lords turning this to be the occaſion of Davids exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did the more admirably diſcover that there was a ſpeciall hand of God in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this about, no man at all contributing any help thereto.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.]</hi> That is, if they have laid any thing to gage for their neceſſity, redeem it out; or bring me ſome pledge or other from them, whereby I may be ſatisfied concerning their welfare.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Now Saul and they, and all the men of Iſrael were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philiſtines.]</hi> To wit, In a mountain that lay cloſe upon the valley of Elah. The body of the Iſraelites Army, lay encamped againſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines on a mountain, verſe 3. <hi>And the Philiſtines ſtood on a mountain on the one ſide, and Iſrael ſtood on a mountain on the other ſide, and there was a valley between them.</hi> But from thence happily now and then they maintaind ſome skirmiſhes with the Philiſtines; and thence it is ſaid here, that <hi>they were in the valley of Elah, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Philistines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to fight.]</hi> That is, to skirmiſh with the enemy, or to ſtand in battell ray ready to fight, if they could get any advantage againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>The man who killeth him, the king will enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his fathers houſe free in Iſrael.]</hi> That is, free from taxes, and other impoſitions, and ſo ennoble his family. With theſe words the Iſraelites did as it were encourage one another in the hearing of David to undertake the challenge of this daring Philiſtine, and by propounding the great rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him that ſhould undertake this ſervice; they did as it were covertly intimate that it ſeemed ſtrange to them, that no body ſhould be wonne hereby to hazard their lives in ſuch a noble exploit: But in the mean ſeaſon, even they that talked thus would not venture their own perſons, but hung off for fear no leſſe then others; but thus indeed it is uſuall with men to encourage others to undertake works of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and danger, which themſelves will not come nigh in any degree.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And David ſpake to the men that ſtood by him, ſaying, What ſhall be done to the man that killeth this Philiſtine,</hi> &amp;c.] Having heard what rewards were promiſed to the man that ſhould kill this champion of the Philiſtines, he asketh them again concerning that, not becauſe it was the great rewards propoſed that drew him on, but that by this inquiry they might perceive his inclination to undertake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Doubtleſſe, that which moved David to think of undertaking the combat, was his zeal for the glory of God, and the honour of his people. It tended exceedingly to their reproach and diſhonour, that a proud uncircumciſed cai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iffe ſhould come and out-brave the whole Army of Gods people, and not a man amongſt them ſhould dare to grapple with him: And this it was that made him think of entring the liſts with him: though therefore he enquired after the rewards promiſed; yet that was onely to let the ſtanders by perceive that he had ſome thoughts of underſtanding the combat: for it was to vindicate the honour of God and his people, that he heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the motion of fighting; and ſo much his words do indeed plainly import, <hi>what ſhall be done unto the man that taketh away the reproach from Iſrael? For who is this uncircumciſed Philistine, that he ſhould defie the Armies of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:42229:152"/>Verſ. 28. <hi>Why camest thou down hither, and with whom hast thou left thoſe few ſheep in the wilderneſſe?]</hi> Eliab Davids elder brother, being filled with envy againſt him, as diſdaining that he ſhould think of fighting with that Giant, with whom, neither himſelf nor any other in the army durſt encounter; brake out into theſe words of reproch and ſcorn, twitting him with his ſheep that he had left in the wilderneſſe; <hi>with whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep in the wilderneſſe?</hi> As intimat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng that he was fitter to return to his ſheep-hook, and his harp again, then to intermeddle with martiall affairs, and upbraiding him with arrogance and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I know thy pride, and the naughtineſſe of thine heart; for thou art come down, that thou mighteſt ſee the battell:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, ſcorning to follow that imployment which belongs to thee, to wit, the keeping of our fathers ſheep, nothing will ſerve thy turn but to be a ſouldier, and therefore art thou come hither, to ſee if by any means thou canſt wind in thy ſelf, to ſerve here in the army.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And David ſaid, What have I now done? Is there not a cauſe?]</hi> That is, was there not a juſt cauſe for my coming hither? Did not my father ſend me? And is there not juſt cauſe of ſpeaking that which I have ſpoken? Is it not a ſhame that this wretch ſhould thus out-face the armies of Iſrael, and no body ſhould dare to undertake him?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>And there came a Lion, and a Beare,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, there came a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at one time, and a Beare at another time; for it cannot be meant that they came both together, and together took one kid out of the flock: and therefore alſo in the next words he ſpeaks of his killing them ſeverally; <hi>I went out after him, and ſmote him,</hi> &amp;c. To wit, the Lion at one time, and the Beare at another.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And when he aroſe, I took him by the beard,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, by his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther jaw, or the hair about his jaw. Had he killed him caſually, by ſhooting, or caſting any thing at him it had not been ſo great a matter; but thus to kill him was an act indeed of admirable courage.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>And Saul ſaid unto David, Go, and the Lord be with thee.]</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange that Saul ſhould yield to let David enter the liſts with Goliath, conſidering how unequall the match was in the eye of reaſon, and that Goliath had propounded this as a condition in his challenge, that if he vanquiſhed the man that fought with him, then the Iſraelites ſhould be for ever ſervants to the Philiſtines: but doubtleſſe however at firſt he ſleighted Davids proffer, and told him that he was every way unfit to grapple with ſuch an adverſary, verſ. 33. Yet when he had heard Davids courage and reſolution, and confidence in Gods help, and the relation of theſe two miraculous exploits of his, againſt the Lion and the Beare, this wrought in him ſome kind of faint hope; yea perhaps ſome temporary faith, that God would miraculouſly aſſiſt him, and ſo he gave him liberty, and wiſhed him good ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>And Saul armed David with his armour,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour out of his own armoury; for it is not likely that the armour which Saul uſed to wear could fit David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And David ſaid unto Saul, I cannot go with theſe; for I have not proved them.]</hi> That is, I have not been uſed to wear ſuch arms, and ſo they are a burden to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:42229:152"/>Verſ. 40. <hi>And he took his ſtaffe in his hand, and choſe him five ſmooth ſtones out of the brook,</hi> &amp;c.] The ſleighter the means were, whereby David overcame this Giant, the more evident it was, that the victory was of God. And thus too the means whereby Chriſt overcame Sathan, were not likely in the eye of reaſon to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh ſuch an adverſary; for he overcame him by the croſſe, death, &amp;c. Yea, this was indeed to kill that Goliath with his own ſword: Heb. 2.14. <hi>That through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>And when the Philistine looked about and ſaw David, he diſdained him: For he was but a youth, and ruddy,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he had not the countenance of a ſouldier, it was rather amiable then terrible.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>And the Philiſtine curſed David, by his Gods.]</hi> That is, he wiſhed ſome miſchief or evil might be inflicted on him by his idol-god, to wit, that Dagon might deſtroy him, or ſome other ſuch like imprecation.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 45. <hi>But I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Iſrael, whom thou haſt defied.]</hi> He tells him that he had defied the Lord of hoſts, becauſe he had defied the Iſraelites his people: for God alwayes takes any wrong done to them, as done to himſelf; and by ſaying that he came againſt Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath, <hi>in the name of the Lord of hoſts,</hi> he meant that he came againſt him to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the diſhonour that he had done to the Lord, and that by warrant from God, and in the aſſured confidence of his aid and aſſiſtance, whence is that which he addes, verſ. 46. <hi>This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand, and I will ſmite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcaſes of the hoſt of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines this day, unto the fowls of the aire, and to the wild beaſts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a God in Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 47. <hi>And all this aſſembly ſhall know, that the Lord ſaveth not with ſword and ſpear.]</hi> That is, that he can ſave without theſe, and is not tied to ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 49. <hi>And ſmote the Philiſtine in his forehead, that the ſtone ſunk into his forehead,</hi> &amp;c.] Either therefore the ſtone which David ſlung was caſt with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary force, through the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of God, that it went through his helmet of braſſe, and ſo into his fore-head: or elſe the Philiſtine, as not fearing any thing which David could do, never pulled down his helmet over his face, but went with his face open to fight with David: however, the very guiding of the ſtone ſo directly to the forehead of this gyant, was doubtleſſe of God: for though it was uſuall with the Iſraelites to be able to ſling ſtones at an hairs breadth, Judg. 20.16. <hi>Among all theſe people, there were ſeven hundred choſen men left-handed, every one could ſling stones at an hairs breadth, and not miſſe:</hi> yet the mark was then fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Goliaths forehead, though it were a fairer mark, yet it was leſſe eaſie to be hit, becauſe he was ſtirring; onely God guided the ſtone, and ſo lodged it in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of this blaſpheming Miſcreant.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 51. <hi>And when the Philistines ſaw their champion was dead, they fled.]</hi> God ſtriking them with a ſecret terrour; for elſe little might they have regarded the loſſe of Goliath, being ſo ſtrong as they were; nor the promiſe which he had made verſ. 9. that the Philiſtines ſhould be ſervants to the Iſraelites, in caſe their Champion ſhould foil and kill him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:42229:153"/>Verſ. 52. <hi>And the wounded of the Philiſtines, fell down by the way to Shaara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im.]</hi> A town in the borders of Judah, Joſh. 15.36.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 54. <hi>And David took the head of the Philiſtine and brought it to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.]</hi> For though the ſtrong hold of Sion was as yet in the poſſeſſion of the Jebuſites, and ſo continued till David took it from them when he came to be king, 2. Sam. 5.7. Yet the city of Jeruſalem it ſelf was long before this in the poſſeſſion of the Iſraelites, Judges 1.8, <hi>The children of Judah had fought againſt Jeruſalem and had taken it.</hi> And therefore the Iſraelites returning now in triumph from the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Philiſtines, David carried the head of this Gyant in triumph with him, and at laſt laid it up in Jeruſalem as a monument of this glorious victory: The rather perhaps chooſing to carry it to Jeruſalem, that the Jebuſites that hitherto kept that ſtrong hold there might be terrified with this ſight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he put his Armour in his tent.]</hi> This is meant either of the tent which David afterwards provided for the Ark of God, 1. Chron. 15.1. and therefore called <hi>his tent.</hi> Or elſe, rather it is meant of his own private tent, where it ſeems, he kept all Goliahs armour for a time; though afterward it is evident that his ſword was laid up in the Tabernacle of the Lord at Nob, Chap. 21.9. <hi>And the Prieſt ſaid, The ſword of Goliath the Philiſtine whom thou ſleweſt in the valley of Elah, behold it is wrapt up in a cloth behind the Ephod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 55. <hi>He ſaid unto Abner captain of the hoſt, Abner, whoſe ſonne is this youth?]</hi> This may well ſeem ſtrange, conſidering what is ſaid before concerning Saul and David, chap. 16.21. <hi>And David came to Saul, and ſtood before him, and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour bearer.</hi> And indeed ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours do certainly hereupon conclude, that there is here a tranſpoſition of the hiſtory, and that theſe things related in this chapter were done before that which is related in the foregoing chapter, concerning Sauls ſending for David to play before him, &amp;c. But yet it is not ſafe to change the order of the hiſtory without neceſſary cauſe, and that, here I find not. For, notwithſtanding all that had formerly paſſed between Saul and David: how this might be that Saul ſhould not now know Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid we may well enough conceive, if we conſider, Firſt, That the countenance of young men when they grow toward ripeneſſe of years, and begin to have hair on their faces, many times doth much alter in a little while. Secondly, That great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages do take little notice of their meaner ſervants, and therefore eaſily forget them. Thirdly, That Saul was troubled with melancholly and frantick fits, and ſuch men will often forget thoſe that formerly they have ſeemed much to reſpect. For all this conſidered, it needs not ſeem impoſſible that Saul ſhould before this greatly love David, (to wit, according to the reſpect which muſitians or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants find with Princes) and appoint him to be one of thoſe that ſometimes carried his ſheild before him; and yet having afterwards ſent him home to his father, ſhould not know him when he came to the camp in other apparell and with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other countenance to viſit his brethren. And as for Abner being a martiall man and often abroad, he might in thoſe times take little notice of David.</p>

Secondly, The likeneſſe and ſuitableneſſe of their qualities and diſpoſitions: Jonathan was a ſtout couragious Prince, pious and faithfull, and therefore when David had manifeſted himſelf to be eminently ſuch likewiſe, <hi>the ſoul of Jonathan was knit with the ſoul of David.</hi> Thirdly, The glory that God had done him in giving him the victory over that proud Gyant that had both defied and terrified the whole army of Iſrael; this ſhewed plainly that he was highly eſteemed of God, and pretious in his eyes, and ſo he loved him as one that was dearly beloved of God. Fourthly, The gratious ſpeeches that came from David upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for that ſeems to be ſpecially aimed at in thoſe words, <hi>when he had made an end of ſpeaking unto Saul, the ſoul of Jonathan was knit with the ſoul of David,</hi> And Fifthly, There was doubtleſſe a ſpeciall hand of God in inclining the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Jonathan thus unto David; for by this means God provided David a freind in Sauls court to plead for him, to reveal Sauls plots and intendments againſt him, and to be by his true love a comfort and ſupport to David in all his approching troubles and ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant.]</hi> That is, a covenant of entire friendſhip and brotherly love.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And Jonathan ſtript himſelf of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David.]</hi> To wit, that hereby he might teſtifie that he eſteemed him as his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſelf, and that whatever he had, all his authority, and power, and wealth he ſhould be alwayes ready to beſtow and imploy it for Davids welfare and ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And Saul ſet him over the men of warre.]</hi> That is, he made him a Captain over ſome of his troops, and imployed him as a commander in his warres; For this is not meant of that dignity which Saul had formerly conferred upon Abner, chap. 14.50. who was the Captain of his hoſt, that is, the chief Generall of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: that place he ſtill retained as is evident in many places of the following ſtory.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>The women came out of all the cities of Iſrael ſinging and dauncing to meet king Saul,</hi> &amp;c.] It was it ſeems the uſuall cuſtome of theſe times amongſt the people of God, that when God had given them any great victory over their enemies, the women were wont with dances and ſongs of triumph to celebrate the praiſes of God: For ſo it was with the women of Iſrael when the Egyptians were drowned in the red ſea, Exod, 15.20. And with Jephthahs daughter and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when Jephthah had vanquiſhed the Ammonites, <hi>his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances,</hi> Judges 11.32. And therefore now from all the cities of Iſrael that Saul paſſed by with his army as he returned home from the valley of Elah, where he had vanquiſhed the Philiſtines, the women came out with ſongs and dances to congratulate his victory. As women have uſually the heavieſt ſhare in the calamities of a land that is overrun by an enemy, and that becauſe they are leaſt able to reſiſt, and ſo are frequently taken for ſlaves, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed and abuſed in the moſt ſavage manner; ſo have they likewiſe therefore the greateſt cauſe to rejoyce when the enemy is vanquiſhed; and hence it may be was
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42229:154"/>
this cuſtome of womens triumphing at every great victory. But however, in this triumphing of Gods people for the fall of Goliath, and the vanquiſhing of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, there was a kind of figure and ſhadow, of the triumphant joy of Gods elect people for Chriſts conqueſt over Sathan, and their prevailing over their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enemies through the merits and aſſiſtance of Chriſt, Rev. 12.10, 11. <hi>I heard a loud voice ſaying in heaven, now is come ſalvation and strength, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our God and the power of his Chriſt; for the accuſer of our brethren is caſt down,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they overcame him by the bloud of the Lambe and by the word of their testimony:</hi> ſuch was the rejoycing of the virgin Mary and Zachary, Luke 1.46. <hi>My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord,</hi> ſaith Mary, <hi>and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour. And bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> ſaith Zachary, <hi>for he hath viſited and redeemed his people, and hath raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for us in the houſe of his ſervant David,</hi> verſ. 68.69. Yea thus do all Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones triumph, becauſe Chriſt hath made them <hi>more then Conquerours</hi> over all their enemies, Rom. 8.33, 39.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Saul hath ſlain his thouſands, and David his ten thouſands,]</hi> To Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid they aſcribed ten times as much as to Saul, becauſe by his killing of Goliath he was the cauſe of the routing of the whole army. Now ſo ſolemn and glorious was the triumph of the Iſraelites, and ſuch generall notice was taken of this particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the womens ſong, that it came to be reported and known to the Philiſtines, as we may ſee, chap. 21.11. <hi>And the ſervants of Achiſh ſaid unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? Did not they ſing one to another of him in dances, ſaying, Saul hath ſlain his thouſands, and David his ten thouſands?</hi> And chap. 29.5. <hi>Is not this David, of whom they ſang one to another in dances, ſaying, Saul hath ſlain his thouſands, and David his ten thouſands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And he ſaid, They have aſcribed unto David ten thouſands, and to me they have aſcribed but thouſands: and what can he have more but the kingdome?]</hi> The meaning is, that from thenceforth he began to ſuſpect that David was the man of whom Samuel had told him, that ſhould be king in his room, chap. 13.14. <hi>The Lord hath ſought him out a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be captain over his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And Saul eyed David from that day forward.]</hi> That is, he looked upon him with an envious and malitious eye, and watched for an opportunity to make him away.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>The evil ſpirit from God came upon Saul, and he propheſied in the midſt of the houſe.]</hi> In his frantick fits it is ſaid that Saul propheſied, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſung ſongs, perhaps ſuch hymns and ſongs as were uſually ſung by the ſonnes of the Prophets, which is uſually called propheſying in the Scriptures, as we may ſee in a former note, chap. 10.5. And this he might do by the ſuggeſtion of Sathan: Or elſe, becauſe generally being beſides himſelf, and poſſeſſed with an evil ſpirit, both his behaviour and ſpeech in ſome regard, was outwardly ſuch as when the Prophets were ſtirred by the ſpirit of God, who in their extaſies and raptures had ſome uncompoſed kind of motions and actions, and were as men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves for the time; and therefore often termed mad men, 2. Kings 9.11. <hi>Wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?</hi> ſo Jer. 29.26. <hi>Every man that is mad
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42229:154"/>
and maketh himſelf a prophet,</hi> &amp;c. Men poſſeſſed do many times utter ſtrange languages and words, which they formerly never learned nor underſtood; yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they will divine of ſecret things, as no doubt that damſel did, that was <hi>poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of divination,</hi> Acts 16.16. As therefore thoſe idolatrous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of the people that were never ſent of God, were yet uſually called prophets; ſo here Saul, becauſe his ſpeech and carriage was in ſome particulars like that of Gods prophets, is here ſaid to have propheſied.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Saul cast the javelin, for he ſaid, I will ſmite David to the wall with it.]</hi> And this he did twice (perhaps in two ſeverall fits) as the follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words imply: <hi>and David avoided out of his preſence twice.</hi> Whileſt David ſought to cure Saul of his phrenſie, Saul ſought to take away his life. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whileſt our Saviour ſought the health of the Jews, and their recovery out of Sathans power, by preaching to them the glad tidings of the Goſpel, they often ſought to kill him, ſometimes openly, ſometimes ſecretly, that he was oft forced to withdraw himſelf from them; as there at Nazareth, Luke 4, 28, 29, 30. <hi>And they all in the Synagogue when they heard theſe things were filled with wrath, And they roſe up, and thruſt him out of the city, and lead him to the brow of the hill (whereon the city was built) that they might cast him down headlong. But he paſſing through the midst of them went his way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ, 13. <hi>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his Captain over a thouſand,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, a Colonel or a chief Commander in his army. Perceiving that David by his watchfulneſſe did ſtill decline the ſtroke of his jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and perhaps that he did forbear to come at him any more in his frantick fits, <hi>he removed him from him,</hi> that is, he reſolved to imploy him abroad, that he might not be vexed any more with the ſight of him, and ſo he made him one of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, hoping alſo, that he would ſome time or other be ſlain in the battel; and thence it is ſaid of David in the following words, that <hi>he went out and came in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people,</hi> that is, he led them out to battel, and brought them back again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Saul ſaid to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife.]</hi> And thus under a pretence of performing that promiſe formerly made to him that ſhould kill Goliath, chap. 17.25. he ſought to expoſe David to the ſword of the Philiſtines: For this renued promiſe of his daughter he hoped, would make him the more eagerly proſecute his warres againſt them, and then one time or other he thought the Philiſtines might ſlay him; but now all this while he never ſeriouſly intended ſhe ſhould be his wife, or elſe he ſoon changed his mind; for within a while after he gave her to another man; of which ſee the note upon verſ. 19.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>What is my life, or my fathers family in Iſrael, that I ſhould be ſonne in law to the king?]</hi> What is my parentage, education, condition of life, that I ſhould think my ſelf a fit husband for a kings daughter? And thus he modeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the honour that was tendered him, as knowing that as yet they underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his being anointed to ſucceed Saul.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>But it came to paſſe at the time when Merab Sauls daughter ſhould have been given to David that ſhe was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.]</hi> This Adriel the Meholathite was the ſonne of Barzillai, as is expreſſely noted,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42229:155"/>
2. Sam. 21.8. Where alſo it is recorded, that all the ſonnes that he had by this daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Saul, (that we may ſee how the curſe of God followed this unlawfull match) were hanged up, in ſatisfaction to the Gibeonites; for they are certainly Adriels ſonnes by Merab that are mentioned there, onely they were brought up by Michal; of which ſee the note there. It ſeems the promiſe of giving her to David to wife, carried on ſo farre, that the time was ſet for ſolemnizing the marriage, and yet then <hi>at the time when Merab ſhould have been given to David, ſhe was given to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driel:</hi> which is very obſervable in many regards. For firſt, we ſee that God having appointed Michal not Merab to be Davids wife, the match propounded with Merab did not ſucceed: ſecondly, hereby the malice and wickedneſſe of Saul was notably diſcovered; it being evident, that either he never meant this marriage, though he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to go on ſo farre: or elſe, that ſuddenly he changed his mind, hoping by this diſgrace to drive David to ſome diſcontent and violent courſe, that ſo he might take occaſion from thence to cut him off: and thirdly, the wonderfull wiſdome and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of David was hereby manifeſted, who bare all this quietly, and ſtirred not. It was a matter of great reproch and deriſion to David, that he ſhould be thus led on with hopes of a wife, and then in an inſtant another ſhould get her from him, and yet all this could not ſtirre David to do any thing that was not lawfull or ſeemly for him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And Michal Sauls daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleaſed him well.]</hi> Not that he was pleaſed to ſee David beloved, (for we ſee how highly he was diſpleaſed with Jonathan, becauſe he loved David) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hoped by that means to bring his purpoſe about, for the deſtroying of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid: and the very hope of doing hurt to a party hated, yields great content to a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And Saul ſaid, I will give him her that ſhe may be a ſnare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.]</hi> This was Sauls plot, but it proved contrary: for Michal proved a means to help him out of the ſnare which Saul had laid for him, chap. 19.11, 12. and Saul fell afterwards into the hands of the Philiſtines, but not David.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore Saul ſaid to David, Thou ſhalt this day be my ſonne in law, in one of the twain.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Though I failed before, yet I will make thee amends now; I have but two daughters, and one of the twain thou ſhalt have; And ſo being by this means my ſonne in law, it will be no great wrong though thou hadſt not the eldeſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Saul commanded his ſervants, ſaying, Commune with David ſecretly, and ſay, Behold, the king hath a delight in thee, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, as if it came from your ſelves, and not from me. Becauſe he had before twice promiſed his daughter, and had not kept his word, he was fain to imploy his Courtiers now to perſwade David to accept his offer, and to engage their credit, that the king did really intend what he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And David ſaid, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a kings ſonne in law, ſeeing that I am a poore man, and lightly eſteemed?]</hi> That is, not able to give a dowry fit for Sauls daughter, and therefore was ſleighted about his other daughter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:42229:155"/>Verſ. 25. <hi>Thus ſhall ye ſay to David, The king deſireth not any dowry, but an hundred fore-skinnes of the Philiſtines,</hi> &amp;c.] Why are the fore-skinnes required, rather then the heads of the Philiſtines? Firſt, to imply the ground why Saul deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this, to wit, becauſe they were enemies to God, and to his people. Secondly, to enrage the Philiſtines the more againſt David; for hatred to circumciſion would make them abhorre this act of David, of cutting off the fore-skinnes from the dead bodies of their brethren, more then any thing that could have been done to them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>It pleaſed David well to be the kings ſonne in law, and the dayes were not expired,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems that Michal was promiſed David, upon condition that he ſhould bring Saul <hi>an hundred fore-skinnes of the Philiſtines,</hi> within a certain time prefixed: Or elſe there was a time ſet for the marriage, before which he was to bring theſe fore-skinnes of the Philiſtines. And therefore it is here noted, that before this time was expired, he did what was impoſed; yea, to make ſure that Saul ſhould not cavill, he brought <hi>two hundred,</hi> v. 27. in ſtead of an hundred.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And Saul was yet more afraid of David.]</hi> To wit, as conſidering now that this marriage with his daughter, was a fair ſtep to the crown and kingdom,</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>Then the Princes of the Philistines went forth.]</hi> To wit, to make warre with the Iſraelites: And it may well be, that beſides their deſire to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the Iſraelites for the late defeat of their armies when Goliah was ſlain, even the late ſlaughter which David had made amongſt the Philiſtines, when he brought an hundred of their fore-skinnes to Saul, had mightily enraged them; and this was the occaſion of their preſent invading the land of Iſrael.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Saul ſpake to Jonathan his ſonne, and to all his ſervants, that they ſhould kill David.]</hi> Hitherto Saul had done all that he did againſt David ſecretly; but now he grew impudent and ſhameleſſe, <hi>Saul ſpake to Jonathan his ſonne, and to all his ſervants, that they ſhould kill David:</hi> For in theſe words there are two things that diſcover how violently Sauls paſſion and rage againſt Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, did at length break forth: The firſt, that he did not impart his deſire to have him ſlain, to ſome few of his truſtieſt ſervants, but generally to them all. The ſecond, that though he knew the great league that was betwixt David and Jonathan, yet he moued him alſo to joyn in this plot, hoping no doubt to prevail with him, by urging his fear of Davids getting the crown from him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And Jonathan told David, ſaying, Saul my father ſeeketh to kill thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Whileſt David was eſteemed Sauls favourite, all his Courtiers carried a fair ſhew towards him, chap. 18.5. <hi>He was accepted in the ſight of all the people, and and alſo in the ſight of Sauls ſervants:</hi> and who then could fawn upon him more then they? ver. 22. <hi>Behold, the king hath a delight in thee, and all his ſervants love thee, now therefore be the kings ſonne in law.</hi> But when Saul had once diſcovered the ill will he bare him, and openly enjoyned them to make him away, not a man amongſt them would open his mouth to Saul for him; or do any thing to prevent the danger he was in: onely Jonathan that did indeed truly love him, did then diſcover to David his fathers bloudy purpoſe, and afterwards ſpake to his father in his behalf, though he now forbare to ſay any thing for the preſent, becauſe he ſaw that now he
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42229:156"/>
was in a rage, and judged it therefore better to ſtay a while, till his fury was over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now therefore, I pray thee, take heed unto thy ſelf untill the morning, and abide in a ſecret place, and hide thy ſelf.]</hi> Jonathan here counſells David, firſt, that he ſhould be very carefull to look to himſelf, that no evil was done him the following night, before he could ſpeak to his father for him, <hi>take heed to thy ſelf untill the morning.</hi> And then ſecondly, that the next day he ſhould hide himſelf in ſome ſecret place, to wit, in the field where Saul was wont to walk out &amp; take the aire, (and no doubt they agreed about the very place) that ſo David might heare what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his father and him, when they talked together concerning David: for that this is the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>abide in a ſecret place, and hide thy ſelf,</hi> is evident by the words that follow, ver. 3. <hi>And I will go out and ſtand beſide my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father,</hi> &amp;c. Onely he addes, that if Saul ſpake ſo that David could not heare him, then he would afterwards tell Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid what he ſaid, which is added in the laſt clauſe, <hi>and what I ſee, that I will tell thee.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And Jonathan ſpake good of David unto Saul his father,</hi> &amp;c.] Though he knew that his father was troubled with frantick fits, and might in rage ſeek to kill him for ſpeaking in Davids behalf; yet he reſolved to hazard this rather then deſert David in a righteous cauſe. And obſervable it is, that venturing himſelf thus for David, God ſo awed the ſpirit of Saul, that Jonathan ſuffered no evil by it.</p>

By pleading the good ſervice that David had done to the Church and Common-wealth of Iſrael, in killing that formidable gyant Goliath, he ſought to convince Saul, what an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinne it would be to ſeek now to kill him. But moſt obſervable are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, wherein he preſſeth this further upon Saul, <hi>thou ſaweſt it, and didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce:</hi> for by putting Saul in mind what a wonderfull joy it was to him at that time when he ſtood by, and ſaw the Philiſtine fall by the hand of David, he intimates what an high degree of ingratitude it would be, ſo ill now to repay that noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit of his, which when time was did ſo exceedingly affect him, that he would then have thought no good he could have done him, a ſufficient requitall of his great merits.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Saul ſought to ſmite David,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note chap. 18.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Saul alſo ſent meſſengers unto Davids houſe, to watch him, and to ſlay him in the morning.]</hi> It is hard to ſay what the reaſons were that moved Saul to give theſe directions to the meſſengers that he ſent to ſlay David, not to break pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in upon him, and to ſlay him in the night, but to lie in wait about the houſe, &amp; then to <hi>ſlay him in the morning.</hi> Some conceive it was, becauſe when he came forth in the morning, they might happely kill him ſuddenly and ſecretly, no body taking notice who had done it; and that this Saul deſired for fear of the diſpleaſure and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries of the people againſt him: ſecondly again, others hold on the contrary, that this courſe was preſcribed, becauſe the more openly it was done, the more likely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be to think that it was done for ſome treachery of Davids, and juſtly done; whereas their doing it in the night would make them ſuſpect that they did it cauſeleſſely, and durſt not avow the doing of it: and thirdly, others ſay, (and that I
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42229:156"/>
think moſt probably) that this courſe was onely taken, to make ſure that David might not eſcape their hands; (for indeed when Saul had openly already commanded his ſervants and ſonne to ſlay David, there was no thinking to do it ſo, that Sauls malice againſt him ſhould be concealed.) Had they attempted the breaking in upon his houſe in the night, his wife, or ſervants, or friends might by ſome means in the dark convey him away; but in the morning he could not ſo eaſily ſlip away from them: and therefore they were ordered to lie in wait ſecretly about the houſe in the night, and then early in the morning to break in upon him. But however, there was doubtleſſe an hand of providence that did bend Sauls reſolutions to this courſe, whatever the reaſons were that moved him thereto, that ſo David might not be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurprized in his houſe, but might have the more time and leaſure to provide for his eſcape.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Michal Davids wife told him, ſaying, If thou ſave not thy life to night, to morrow thou ſhalt be ſlain.]</hi> For knowing the cauſe why David fled ſo lately from Saul, and having perhaps caſually diſcovered that Sauls ſervants were watching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the houſe; ſhe might eaſily gueſſe their errand, or elſe ſome friend might ſend her word of it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats hair for his bolſter,</hi> &amp;c.] After ſhe had let down her husband out of a window, that ſo he might eſcape away for his life, ſhe uſed this further project to prevent the meſſengers ſurprizing of him; expecting every moment that they would break into the houſe to look for him; and conceiving that if they found him not in the houſe, they would conclude he was eſcaped away, and ſo would preſently get them forth to purſue after him. To prevent this, ſhe reſolved to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was ſick in bed, and to that end laid an image in his bed, as if a ſick man had lien there; that ſo the meſſengers being deluded hereby, might not ſuſpect his eſcape, and ſo might be quite beaten off from ſeeking further after him; or at leaſt, that though they ſhould diſcover this deceit, yet they might for a while be thereby brought into ſuch a demurre, that her husband might have the more time to get away, beyond any likelihood of their overtaking him. The word here tranſlated <hi>an image,</hi> is in the Original <hi>teraphim,</hi> whereby in the Scripture is uſually meant certain idols which the idolaters of thoſe times did make uſe of as their Oracles, as is formerly noted upon Judg. 17.5. But withall it may well be, that hereupon any image or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was alſo called teraphim: and ſo this which Michal now uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might be merely a ſtatue, perhaps Davids own ſtatue; or elſe ſome ſuperſtitious image which ſhe kept in the houſe in ſecret, David knowing nothing of it. As for the pillow of goats hair which ſhe uſed for a bolſter, ſome conceive that this was laid, that the curled locks of the goats hair about the head of the image, might reſemble the hair of Davids head: for ſay they, Davids hair was yellow, and ſo was the hair of thoſe goats that were bred in the land of Gilead; whence is that Cant. 4.1, <hi>Thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from mount Gilead.</hi> But becauſe the ground of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is altogether uncertain, I rather think that this was laid under the head of the image, becauſe for the ſoftneſſe and warmth ſuch pillars were ordinarily uſed for them that were ſick.</p>

It is but a weak conceit me thinks, which I find in ſome Expoſitours, to wit, that this is not ſpoken of thoſe meſſengers mentioned before, verſ. 11. that were firſt ſent to ſlay David; but of others ſent after them: The firſt ſay they, waiting for Davids coming forth, did not go into the houſe, and ſo Saul ſent others with the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that he gave to the firſt. But this is ſuppoſed without any juſt ground in the text, who can think that the firſt would wait ſo long for Davids coming forth, and never go to ſearch for him in the houſe, till Saul ſhould ſuſpect they neglected their charge, and ſo ſend others after them? No doubtleſſe, theſe were the firſt meſſengers mentioned before; onely Sauls ſending them, is here repeated again. And the words therefore muſt be thus underſtood: <hi>When Saul ſent meſſengers to take David ſhe ſaid, He is ſick,</hi> that is, when the meſſengers came that Saul had ſent, (which doubtleſſe they did betimes in the morning) ſhe anſwered, He was ſick; and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to his chamber, ſhewed them the image in the bed; which they thought had indeed been here husband, and ſo went away.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And when the meſſengers were come in, beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld there was an image in the bed,</hi> &amp;c.] Before happely when they went in to Michal they might onely look upon the bed afarre off, and ſo the room being dark, as it is wont to be where ſick folks lie, they might eaſily be deceived by the cunning of Michal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and think it was David that lay there a bed. But being now ſent back again by Saul, and appointed to bring him ſick or well, they went up now to the bed to lay hold on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then Michals fraud was ſoon diſcovered; And the unexpectedneſſe of this which they found is here implyed in this word <hi>behold. Behold there was an image in the bed;</hi> They thought verily before, that they had ſeen David there, and when they came now again they found nothing there, but an image of wood or ſtone dreſſed up like a ſick man.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>So David fled, and eſcaped, and came to Samuel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to bewail to him his miſery, and to ſhew, how farre otherwiſe things went with him then he expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in regard Samuel had anointed him to ſucceed Saul in the throne, and withall, to be adviſed by him what he ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.]</hi> Which was a Colledge of prophets: whither Samuel brought David. Firſt, becauſe Saul was not likely to look him there. Secondly, becauſe here Samuel hoped he ſhould be as in a little ſanctuary, and as it were in a ſpeciall manner put into Gods cuſtody. And thirdly, becauſe with that holy company, and ſacred exerciſes there uſed, David might be much comforted in his afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And Saul ſent meſſengers to take David.]</hi> To wit, at Naioth, where he heard David was, as is expreſſed in the foregoing verſe. Doubtleſſe they that told him that he was at Naioth, told him alſo that he was with Samuel there. And yet he gave no order to his meſſengers to meddle with Samuel, becauſe he had entertained the man, whom he purſued, but onely to take David. It was a ſigne of extreme rage that he would have David fetched away by force out of the Colledge of the prophets: But yet withall it argued ſome remainders of reſpect towards Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel that were ſtill in Sauls heart; that all the while the leaſt word was not ſpoken againſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when they ſaw the company of the prophets propheſying, and Samuel ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42229:158"/>
as appointed over them,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when the meſſengers came and found the prophets propheſying, and Samuel as the chief of the quire, or as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer and chief moderatour in thoſe holy and ſpirituall exerciſes wherein they were employed, then they propheſied with them, as men that had quite forgot the bloody errand they came about, and were changed into other men. And indeed, not much unlike this, was that which befell the meſſengers ſent by the Phariſees to apprehend Chriſt, John 7.45, 46. <hi>Then came the officers to the chief Priests and Phariſees, and they ſaid to them, Why have you not brought him? The officers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Never man ſpake as this man.</hi> What is meant by the propheſying of theſe prophets, ſee before in the note upon chap. 10.5.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And he went on &amp; propheſied, untill he came to Naioth in Ramah.]</hi> When Saul had heard that the three companies of his ſervants whom he had ſent to Naioth to apprehend David, propheſied when they came there, &amp; never minded the buſineſſe that he had given them in charge, he reſolved to go and fetch David himſelf: though once before he himſelf had propheſied amongſt the prophets, by the ſupernaturall working of Gods ſpirit upon him, chap. 10.6. (concerning which, ſee the note there) Yet he reſolved, that he would now fetch David out of his ſanctuary, as if he had done it in defiance of God. And behold, whereas his ſervants propheſied not till they came amongſt the prophets, he propheſied as he went, and when he came there, fell down in a trance, &amp;c. So that the more he hardened himſelf againſt God, the more did God ſhew his power upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And he ſtript off his clothes alſo, and propheſied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he laid aſide his upper garments, his princely robes and military apparell, behaving himſelf now as any other common perſon. And this is all the nakedneſſe intended in the following words, as in the ſame regard, the like is ſaid of the prophet Iſaiah, Iſa. 20.2. <hi>At the ſame time ſpake the Lord by the prophet Iſaiah the ſonne of Amos, ſaying, Go and looſe the ſack-cloth from thy loins, and put off thy ſhoe from thy foot: And he did ſo, walking naked and barefoot.</hi> And of David, 2. Sam. 6.20. <hi>Who uncovered himſelf to day in the eyes of his handmaids of his ſervants,</hi> &amp;c. And of the prophet Micah, chap. 1.8. <hi>I will go ſtript and naked.</hi> As for that which is ſaid here of his lying down, or falling down, ſome underſtand this onely of his falling down to humble himſelf in prayer as the other did: But I rather conceive, that this is to be underſtood of his falling down and lying in a trance, as Balaam did, Numb. 24.4. When he had propheſied a while with the other, this at length befell him peculiarly: For, hereby the power of God was the more magnified, and Saul expoſed to ſhame and reproch amongſt all that ſhould ſee, how in the midſt of his fury he was caſt down, bound and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled by the mighty power of God, and then withall, David had the freer, and longer liberty to eſcape for his life. It is expreſſely ſaid, that all this was done <hi>before Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> which ſeems to contradict what was ſaid before, chap. 15, 35. But of that, ſee the note there.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and ſaid before Jonathan,</hi> &amp;c.] Taking the opportunity of Sauls extaſie, wherein he continued all day and all night, David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came to Gibeah of Saul where Jonathan was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, God forbid; Thou ſhalt not die.]</hi> It ſeems Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than knew nothing of all that Saul had done againſt David, related in the former chapter; at leaſt he might think, that if he had done any thing againſt David, it was onely in ſome frantick fit; and therefore was he thus confident, that David had no ſuch cauſe of fear as he deemed he had: and that the rather too, becauſe of the oath his father had taken, Chap. 19.6. <hi>And Saul ſware, as the Lord liveth he ſhall not die.</hi> And becauſe his father uſed to acquaint him with what he purpoſed to do, <hi>My father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will do nothing either great or ſmall, but that he will ſhew it me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I ſhould not fail to ſit with the king at meat,</hi> &amp;c.] David fearing to venture himſelf in Sauls preſence any more, till he were better ſatisfied how he ſtood affected towards him, doth here preſcribe a way to Jonathan, how this might be diſcovered; namely, that whereas the feaſt of the new moon was to be kept the next day, at which time he uſed to ſit with the king at the table, he would abſent himſelf for three dayes, and if Saul ſhould be highly enraged at this, hereby Jonathan might know that his father intended ſome miſchief to him, and ſo was mad that he was diſappointed of his purpoſe. The feaſt David here ſpeaks of when he was by their ordinary courſe to ſit with the king at meat, was doubtleſſe a holy feaſt, kept with the peace-offerings of the new moon feſtivitie, as is evident, verſ. 26. Where Saul concludes of Davids abſence the firſt day, that by reaſon of ſome legall pollution that had befallen him he abſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>He is not clean,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſurely he is not clean;</hi> and obſervable it is, that Saul as bad as he was, yet was carefull to keep this feaſt of the new moon, and to have his chief princes keep it with him, <hi>To morrow,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>is the new moon, and I ſhould not fail to ſit with the king at meat:</hi> As for the three dayes wherein David ſaith he would abſent himſelf, <hi>But let me go, that I may hide my ſelf in the fields, unto the third day at even,</hi> this time was prefixed by David, becauſe ſooner Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than might not be able happely to enform him, how Saul took his abſence from the feaſt: For though the feſtivitie of the new moon laſted indeed but one day, to wit, the firſt day of the moneth, Numb. 28.1. (Concerning which, ſee the note there,) yet ſome kind of peace-offerings, which were offered on that day, to wit, thoſe that were offered for a vow, or voluntary offering, might be eaten not onely on the ſame day whereon they were offered, but alſo the day following, Levit. 7.16. Therefore it ſeems the feaſt that was begun on the new moon with their peace-offerings, was continued the next day, as is evident, verſ. 27. <hi>And it came to paſſe on the morrow, which was the ſecond day of the moneth, that Davids place was empty</hi> &amp;c. And ſo then the third was allowed for Jonathan to inform David how Saul was affected with his abſence from the feaſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>If thy father at all miſſe me, then ſay, David earnestly asked leave of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:42229:159"/>
me, that he might run to Bethlehem,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems in Sauls abſence they uſed to ask leave of Jonathan ere they left the Court, eſpecially at ſuch a feſtivity as that of the New-moon was, and therefore David deſires Jonathan to ſay, that David had asked leave of him, that he might go and keep the New-moon feaſt with his kinred at Bethlehem. Though David left Saul in a trance at Naioth, chap. 19.23, 24. yet he might be returned thence before this conference which David had with Jonathan; at leaſt he might ſuppoſe that he would ſoon come back again to Gibeah. But how could he conceive that Saul would expect David ſitting at his table in the feaſt of the New-moon, as in former times, when he had been forced ſo lately to flie for his life, both from him, and from his meſſengers ſent to apprehend him? chap. 19. I anſwer, No doubt Saul perſwaded himſelf, that David would think that what he had done, he had done onely in his fits of phrenſie, and that being now come again to himſelf, he would be as farre from laying violent hands upon him, as ever before. Now though David were not ſo ſimply credulous as to think ſo, but diſcerned his ſettled malice againſt him, and verily believed that for all his prophecying at Naioth, he would thirſt after his bloud as formerly; yet ſuppoſing rightly as it was, that Saul in this his confidence and diſſimulation, would expect him at the feaſt the next day; he adviſeth Jonathan to obſerve how he would take his abſence, as concluding that thereby they might diſcern what his purpoſes were. As for Davids appointing Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan by an untruth to excuſe his abſence, in this doubtleſſe David, as the beſt are wont to do, forgot himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>For thou haſt brought thy ſervant into a covenant of the Lord with thee.]</hi> That is, a covenant made in the preſence of God, wherein God was invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bear witneſſe againſt, and to puniſh the party tranſgreſſing the covenant,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If there be in me iniquity, ſlay me thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] It may be that David ſpake this to Jonathan, as to one that had power under his father, even to puniſh with death thoſe that were liable to ſuch a ſentence.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Then ſaid David to Jonathan, Who ſhall tell me?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will not be ſafe for you to come to me, nor yet to truſt ſuch a meſſage with any of your ſervants, how ſhall I know whether your father be enraged at my abſence, or no?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Jonathan ſaid unto David, Come, let us go out into the field.]</hi> Becauſe he could not, it ſeems, ſpeak his mind ſo freely to David in the place where they were, without ſome danger of being over-heard, therefore Jonathan deſired David to go with him out into the field: or rather in anſwer to the queſtion David had propounded in the foregoing verſe, he invites him to go out with him into the field, that there he might ſhew him, how by the token of ſhooting his arrows, he meant to inform him, whether there were any cauſe why he ſhould flee from his father, or no</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>The Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.]</hi> That is, the Lord advance thee to the kingdome as he did my father, and make thee victorious over thine enemies, as my father hath been. Whether he had heard of Davids an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing, either by David himſelf or any other, it is hard to ſay; moſt likely it is that he knew of the doom which Samuel had pronounced againſt his father, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſpeciall hand of God that was with David, did thereupon conclude that doubtleſſe he was the man to whom God intended the kingdome, whereto he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42229:160"/>
yields, and onely ſeeks to make a covenant with David, and therefore we ſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards alſo, how confidently he ſpake of Davids being king: chap. 23.17. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, Fear not, for the hand of my father Saul ſhall not find thee, and thou ſhalt be king over Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And thou ſhalt not onely while yet I live ſhew me the kindneſſe of the Lord</hi> &amp;c.] That is, either firſt, the kindneſſe which the Lord requires us to ſhew one to another, and which is ſo pleaſing and acceptable to him: or ſecondly, the kindneſſe which the Lord is wont to ſhew to his faithfull ſervants, and wherein thou ſhalt approve thy ſelf like unto God: or thirdly, the great kindneſſe which by covenant made in the Lords preſence, thou haſt bound thy ſelf to ſhew me. And thus whileſt David was in an humbled and afflicted eſtate, Jonathan beheld him as king of Iſrael, and ſo did the believing thief look upon Chriſt, when he hung upon the croſſe: Luke 23.42. <hi>And he ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord remember me when thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt into thy kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Let the Lord even require it at the hands of Davids enemies.]</hi> And ſo conſequently of me, if I keep not covenant but prove an enemy to David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Jonathan cauſed David to ſwear again, becauſe he loved him.]</hi> As deſirous to make a ſure and ſtedfaſt league with him, whom he ſo dearly loved.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Then Jonathan ſaid to David, To morrow is the new moon, and thou ſhalt be miſſed,</hi> &amp;c.] See the notes verſ. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thy ſelf when the buſineſſe was in hand, and thou ſhalt remain by the ſtone E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel,</hi> &amp;c.] According to this Tranſlation of ours, the meaning of theſe words muſt needs be this, that Jonathan adviſed David, that on the third day he ſhould go down to the place where he hid himſelf at the firſt, and ſhould ſtay there till he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did by his ſhooting of arrows, according to their following agreement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly inform him whether he might ſafely come to his father or no. Now the place intended, was doubtleſſe that where David hid himſelf when Jonathan firſt gave him notice of his fathers purpoſe to kill him, chap. 19.2. <hi>Saul my father ſeeketh to kill thee, now therefore I pray thee take heed to thy ſelf and hide thy ſelf</hi> &amp;c. and therefore Jonathan ſaith, <hi>Where thou didſt hide thy ſelf, when the buſineſſe was in hand,</hi> becauſe then was the firſt time when Saul did diſcover his purpoſe to kill Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. As for the ſtone <hi>Ezel,</hi> that is, <hi>that ſheweth the way,</hi> which was hard by that place, it was probably ſome ſtone to direct travellers the way they were to go.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20 <hi>And I will ſhoot three arrows on the ſide thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] The reaſon why Jonathan did not agree to meet with David, and ſo to make known to him how his father ſtood affected towards him, but rather to give him warning thus ſecretly by ſhooting of arrows, was becauſe he deſired to decline as much as might be his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers jealouſie of any intercourſe that was betwixt him and David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And Jonathan aroſe, and Abner ſat by Sauls ſide, and Davids place was empty.]</hi> To wit, Jonathan aroſe to Abner coming to ſit down, as thereby teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his reſpect of him, &amp;c. It ſeems that Saul and Jonathan were ſet down at the table before Abner came; and ſo when he came, Jonathan roſe as by way of honour to Abner, becauſe he was the kings coſin, and captain of the hoſt, and then <hi>Abner ſat by Sauls ſide, and Davids place was empty;</hi> whereby it may appear that (as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42229:160"/>
ſaith) Jonathan ſat at the right hand of the king, and David uſed to ſit on his left hand, as being his ſonne in law, and ſo Abner now ſitting on that ſide, he was next Saul, becauſe <hi>Davids place was empty:</hi> yet the meaning of thoſe words <hi>and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan aroſe,</hi> may be, that Saul being ſet down in his ſeat, Jonathan aroſe to ſit down at the table by his father.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Something hath befallen him, he is not clean, ſurely he is not clean.]</hi> See the note verſe 5.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Saul ſaid unto Jonathan his ſonne, Wherefore cometh not the ſonne of Jeſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] This title be gives him <hi>the ſonne of Jeſſe,</hi> ſheweth in part his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and diſpleaſure againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>Thou ſonne of the perverſe rebellious woman,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, thou art right thy mothers ſonne, ſhe hath been alwayes perverſe and rebellious, and ſo art thou: We need not enquire wherein Jonathans mother had deſerved this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for this is the property of wrathfull perſons, to ſpare none in their anger, but to ſpeak any thing that may grieve or diſhonour the partie againſt whom their ſpirit is ſtirred; and therefore he addes alſo, <hi>Thou hast choſen the ſonne of Jeſſe to thine own confuſion, and to the confuſion of thy mothers nakedneſſe:</hi> that is, to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſhame of thy mother, to wit, by bereaving her of the honour of having a king for her ſonne, yea, by bringing a ſtain of diſhoneſty upon her: becauſe if Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid ſhould ſucceed in the kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Jonathan be paſſed by, it would imply that Jonathan were illegitimate, and baſe born, and ſo not fit to inherit, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore David that was onely Sauls ſonne in law, was choſen in his room,</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad.]</hi> That is, his quiver, bow, and arrows.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. <hi>And aſſoon as the lad was gone, David aroſe out of a place towards the ſouth,</hi> &amp;c.] When they firſt agreed that Jonathan ſhould give notice to David, how his father ſtood affected towards him by the ſhooting of his arrows, and the words he ſhould ſpeak to the lad that was ſent to fetch them, they agreed upon this ſecret way of giving David intelligence, becauſe they thought ſome body might be preſent in the field where it was done, and hardly could hope for an opportunity to meet and conſult together; yet when Jonathan had done that, and looking about perceived the coaſt was clear, he ſent away the lad, and <hi>then David aroſe out of a place towards the ſouth,</hi> that is, the place where he had hid himſelf, ſouth-ward of the field where all this had been done, and ſo they had an opportunity beyond their expectation to mourn with one another, and conferre together before their parting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they kiſſed one another, and wept one with another till David exceeded.]</hi> His condition being now in the eye of reaſon moſt grievous and moſt miſerable.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen came David to Nob to Ahimelech the Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c.] It is of no great importance to know whether this Nob were that without Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan in the tribe of Manaſſeh, which is called Nobah, Numb. 32.42. and Judg. 8.11. or that in the tribe of Benjamin near to Anathoth, and therefore joyned often with Anathoth, as in Neh. 11.32. yet moſt probable it is that it was that within Jordan in the tribe of Benjamin: for certain it is that here the tabernacle was, though the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42229:161"/>
Ark was at Kiriathjearim, chap. 7.1.) as is evident verſ. 9. where it is ſaid, that the ſword of Goliath was here wrapt up in a cloth behind the ephod: And well it may be which ſome conceive, that as the Tabernacle was placed in Shiloh, a city of Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im in the dayes of Joſhua, who was of the tribe of Ephraim, and the Ark was in the tribe of Judah in Davids time; ſo likewiſe in the dayes of Saul who was of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, by his adviſe and for his benefit, the Tabernacle was removed from Shiloh to Nob, which belonged to his tribe, and hereupon it was that there were ſo many Prieſts dwelling here at Nob, in regard whereof it is called <hi>the citie of the Prieſts,</hi> chap. 22.19. to wit, that they might attend upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle: for in the 21. chapter of Joſhua, where the cities are expreſſed that were given to the Prieſts, we do not find Nob mentioned amongſt them: and doubtleſſe David being reſolved to flie for his ſafety out of the land, came hither firſt, not onely to get there a ſupply for his wants, but alſo eſpecially to viſit the Tabernacle, that he might there worſhip the Lord before his departure, and ſeek unto him for help and comfort in this houre of adverſity. Though he could not but know that there was much danger of being diſcovered here, becauſe hither to the Tabernacle, they came from all places of the land: yet he would not neglect the viſiting of this houſe of God, before he fled out of the kingdome. As for this Ahimelech, the Prieſt to whom David addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf for ſuccour, either it was the ſame that is before called Ahiah, who was with Saul in Migron, chap. 14.3. or elſe Ahiah and Ahimelech were brothers (for as it is there ſaid of Ahiah that he was the ſonne of Ahitub; ſo alſo it is ſaid of this Ahimelech, chap. 20.9.) and Ahiah being dead, Ahimelech his brother was now high Prieſt in his room: yea, it may ſeem that this Ahimelech was alſo called Abiathar: for Mark 2.26. it is ſaid, that <hi>David went into the houſe of God in the dayes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar the high Prieſt, and did eat the ſhew-bread:</hi> unleſſe we ſay, as ſome do that Abiathar there by our Saviour mentioned, was that Abiathar that was the ſon of this Ahimelech, chap. 22.20. becauſe he ſtood by (as the ſecond Prieſt) and did conſent to give the ſhewbread to David, and that he is there called the high Prieſt, becauſe he did afterward ſucceed his father in that place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and ſaid unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?]</hi> Chriſt ſaith, Mark 2.26. that <hi>David did not onely eat the ſhew-bread himſelf, but gave it alſo to them that were with him:</hi> It is evident therefore that he had now ſome of his ſervants, whom perhaps Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than had ſent after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> going along with him, to whom he carried part of the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread; but thoſe he had left in ſome other place, as himſelf ſaith verſ. 2. <hi>I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed my ſervants to ſuch and ſuch a place,</hi> and came alone to the tabernacle, which Ahimelech could not but much wonder at, and be troubled about it, as fearing that he was fled from Saul, and that if it were ſo, it would be dangerous for him to give him entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And David ſaid unto Ahimelech the Prieſt, the king hath commanded me a buſineſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus that he might procure from Ahimelech food for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his ſervants, David did not onely conceal the buſineſſe of his fleeing from Saul; but alſo told him a direct lie, that Saul had ſent him about a ſecret buſineſſe, and enjoyned him to let no body know of it, and ſo he had appointed his ſervants to meet him elſewhere; and what was the iſſue of this? ſurely it proved the occaſion
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42229:161"/>
of Sauls ſlaying Ahimelech, and the reſt of the Prieſts of that citie, <hi>foureſcore and and five perſons that wore a linen ephod;</hi> yea, of the utter deſtruction of the citie and all the inhabitants thereof, both men, women, and children, as we reade in the following chapter, verſ. 18, 19. A ſad calamity; juſt cauſe had Dauid to rue theſe lies of his ſo long as he lived, and ſo no doubt he did, we ſee he charged it upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when Abiathar brought him the tidings of it, chap. 22.22. <hi>I have occaſioned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the death of all the perſons of thy fathers houſe;</hi> and it is thought that the remorſe for this very ſinne, was freſh in his heart, when he wrote that paſſage in the 119. Pſalme, v. 28, 29. <hi>My ſoul melteth away for heavineſſe, ſtrengthen thou me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy word: Remove from me the way of lying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the Priest anſwered David, and ſaid, There is no common bread under my hand.]</hi> There is no queſtion but the high Prieſt had in his houſe bread enough, provided for thoſe of his family; but it ſeems David was in ſuch haſte, that he would not ſtay for any, but what was there in a readineſſe in the Tabernacle, that he might take it preſently and be gone; and as it follows, verſ. 6. there was no bread there but the ſhew-bread; and therefore it was too that Ahimelech uſed that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>There is no common bread under mine hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there is hallowed bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the young men have kept themſelves at leaſt from women.]</hi> By the Law of God the Prieſts were onely to eat of the ſhew-bread, Lev. 24.9. yet the Prieſt knowing well that charity is to be preferred before all ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and that in caſe of neceſſity the ceremoniall Law was to give way to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, he condeſcended to relieve them with the ſhew-bread; and what he did herein is approved by Chriſt, Matth. 12.3, 4. yet withall he addes this condition, <hi>If the young men have kept themſelves at leaſt from women,</hi> whether their wives or others. Indeed if this had not been ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame neceſſity that diſpenſed with one part of the ceremony, might diſpence with the other, had they been legally unclean in regard of carnall copulation, according to that law, Lev. 15.18. <hi>The woman alſo with whom man ſhall lie with ſeed of copulation, they ſhall both bath themſelves:</hi> they muſt not therefore have ſtarved rather then have eaten of the ſhew-bread: but in this caſe a double impediment would have made the caſe the more queſtionable; and therefore the Prieſt addes this clauſe, <hi>If the young men have kept themſelves, at leaſt from women.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Women have been kept from us about theſe three dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince I came out, and the veſſels of the young men are holy.]</hi> By the veſſels of the young men is meant their bodies, according to thoſe expreſſions; 1. Theſſ. 4.3.4. <hi>For this is the will of God, that you abſtain from fornication, that every one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſſe his veſſel in ſanctification:</hi> and 2. Cor. 4.7. <hi>But we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels:</hi> yet it may be meant too of all they had about them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the bread is in a manner common,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, it is as any other ordinary bread prepared to be the food of the prieſts: Had it been ſtanding upon the table before the Lord it had been another matter, but being taken thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>though it were ſanctified this day in the veſſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> however it was reſerved onely to the prieſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had been hallowed to the Lord, yet to them it was but as any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread, and therefore he needed the leſſe to ſcruple in caſe of neceſſity, to give to others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:42229:162"/>Verſ. 7, <hi>Now a certain man of the ſervants of Saul was there that day, detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Lord, and his name was Doeg, an Edomite.]</hi> To wit, by birth, or becauſe he had dwelt there, as upon the ſame ground, chap. 26.6. Ahimelech is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Hittite:</hi> yet in profeſſion of Religion he was an Iſraelite; (for why elſe was he now detained in the tabernacle, to wit, by ſome vow?) but a wicked wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man he was known to be; a man of ill fame, and therefore now feared by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Chap. 22.22. <hi>And David ſaid unto Abiathar, I knew that day, that Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would ſurely tell Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And David ſaid unto Ahimelech, and is there not here under thy hand a ſpear or ſword?]</hi> This he ſpake no doubt, as deſiring Goliaths ſword.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And David aroſe that day, and fled for fear of Saul, and went to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſh the king of Gath.]</hi> That is, he fled into his countrey. This Achiſh is in the title of the thirty fourth Pſalme called Abimelech; which was the uſuall title of the kings of the Philiſtines, Gen. 20.2. Doubtleſſe he hoped here to have ſojourned unknown; but however, though he could not but apprehend much danger in flying thither; becauſe the Philiſtines were at preſent deadly enemies to the Iſraelites, and his name was above all others abhorred amongſt them, in regard of the many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories he had gotten over them, and the cruell ſlaughters he had made amongſt them, and particularly, for his killing of Goliath who was of Gath, chap. 17.4. Yet ſuch was Sauls rage and Davids fear, that he had more hope of ſafety there, then in the land of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And the ſervants of Achiſh ſaid unto him, Is not this David, the king of the land?</hi> &amp;c.] Having diſcovered and caught David, as it is in the title of the 56. Pſalme, <hi>Michtam of David, when the Philiſtines took him in Gath,</hi> they brought him to Achiſh and made known who he was, that he might conſider what was fit to be done with him, <hi>Is not this David,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the king of the land;</hi> that is, a prince or ruler in the land, or, is not this David that is deſigned to be king in the land; for it may well be thought, that the report that David ſhould be king, and that Saul perſecuted him becauſe of this, was now ſo rife and common in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, that it was ſpread even unto the land of the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himſelf mad,</hi> &amp;c.] Yet ſtill withall he ſought by prayer to God, his hope being in him (though he uſed this plot as a means of eſcape) as appears by the 34. and 56. Pſalmes, which were made by him at this time and upon this occaſion; and indeed, had not the Lord infatuated Achiſh, whereby it was that he altogether ſleighted the matter, how eaſily might this diſſimulation of Davids have been diſcovered in time?</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>DAvid therefore departed thence and went to the cave of Adullam.]</hi> Which was in the Tribe of Judah, Joſh. 15.21, 35. a place of good ſtrength, as appears, 2. Sam. 23.13. and thither no doubt David went, hoping to find relief and comfort in his own tribe, and here perhaps he made the 142. Pſalme; for that was made when he was in a cave, as appears by the title, <hi>Maſchil of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid a prayer when he was in the cave.</hi>

                  <p>

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42229:162"/>
to him.]</hi> To wit, as being or fearing to be perſecuted and oppreſſed by Saul for Davids ſake; and this no doubt added much to his affliction, not onely becauſe it muſt needs greive him to ſee them forced to flie from their lands, houſes, and eſtates for his ſake; but alſo, becauſe it may well be, that his brethren, who did formerly caſt an envious eye upon him, and upbraided him with the pride and naughtineſſe of his heart, would now perhaps, upbraid him with the miſeries he had brought upon them; telling how much better it had been for them, if he had contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with that meaner condition wherein before he lived in his fathers family. But beſides, in that which Davids brethren ſuffered for Davids ſake, Chriſtians may ſee what they muſt look to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake; they are dear and precious to Chriſt as his mother and brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luke 8.21. <hi>My mother and my brethren are theſe, which hear the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do it:</hi> But becauſe of this, therefore doth the world hate them: Matth. 10.22. <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake:</hi> See alſo, John 15.19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And every one that was in diſtreſſe, and every one that was in debt,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe doubtleſſe aimed at the ſheltring themſelves, though they ſtrengthened David by coming in to him. But was it well done in David to entertain ſuch as theſe? I anſwer, that what David did herein, he might do it by a ſpeciall inſtinct of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and ſo that might be lawfull in him, which would not be lawfull in an ordinary way: but then beſides, much may be ſaid in defence of David herein, even in an ordinary way. For firſt, David might not know of the ſeverall ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by debt, or otherwiſe, of thoſe that came in to him. Secondly, he had no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſhelter them againſt any that ſhould demand juſtice againſt them. Thirdly, he meant not to make uſe of them againſt Saul, or to make a prey of the people, but onely for his own juſt defence; we ſee what a teſtimony Nabals ſervants gave of Davids ſouldiers, Chap. 25.15. <hi>The men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt neither miſſed we any thing, as long as we were converſant with them when we were in the fields.</hi> And fourthly, It is probable, that by this time it came to be generally known, that Saul perſecuted David becauſe he was anointed of God by Samuel to ſucceed him in the throne; and if they came, pretending this for their coming, the cauſe they alledged was juſt, and how could David then reject them? It is likely indeed, that the mouths of many were opened againſt him, becauſe of thoſe that followed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alledging that they were a company of needy and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented people, men that had exhauſted their ſtates, and durſt not before ſhew their heads, the very ſcumme and dregs of the people, fit onely to prey upon the eſtates of others; and that David ſhewed now what love he bare to his countrey, and what loyalty to his Prince, in giving entertainment to ſuch as theſe. But ſo long as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids cauſe was juſt, and that he did not undertake to defend them in any evil, nor made uſe of them to oppreſſe others, theſe reproches were unjuſtly caſt upon him; yea in this, as in other things, David was a notable type of Chriſt. For ſuch as theſe that came into David, were whileſt Chriſt lived upon earth, and ſtill are uſually the diſciples of Chriſt; to wit, firſt, poore and deſpiſed men and women, whence was that of the Phariſees, Joh. 7.48. <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him? Ye ſee your calling brethren,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 1.26.) <hi>how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42229:163"/>
called,</hi> &amp;c. and chap. 14.13. <hi>We are made as the filth of the world, and are the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day:</hi> and ſecondly, men and women that lay under the burden of a grievous debt of ſinnes; for publicans and harlots followed Chriſt, when the ſelf-righteous Phariſees, and many of the civiler ſort of people were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him, Matth. 21.31, 32. and at this the world took great offence: <hi>Why eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your Master with Publicans and ſinners,</hi> Matth. 9.11. and again, Matth. 11.19. <hi>the ſonne of man came eating and drinking, and they ſaid behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and ſinners,</hi> and hence is that too, in the ſame chapter, verſ. 5.6. <hi>The poore have the Goſpell preached to them, and bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me:</hi> ſome are of opinion, that it was when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was in this hold of Adullam, that thoſe worthies came to him alſo, that are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, 1. Chron. 12.16. &amp;c. but of that ſee the note there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab, and he ſaid unto the King of Moab,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe his parents, by reaſon of age, were not able well to endure the hardneſſe of being with him in the cave, therefore David went to Miz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peh of Moab, to provide them a place there to ſtay a while in; hoping that the king of Moab would favour him out of hatred to Saul, who had made warre againſt Moab: 1. Sam. 14.47. <hi>Let,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my father and my mother come forth,</hi> that is, out of the land of Iſrael, <hi>and be with you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.]</hi> That is, in the cave of Adullam. Moſt Expoſitours indeed underſtand this of a hold in Mizpeh of Moab: but firſt, there is no ſuch hold mentioned in the foregoing words; and ſecondly, had David been in Mizpeh of Moab, why ſhould it be ſaid he left his father and mother, with the king of that countrey.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 5. <hi>And the Prophet Gad ſaid unto David, Abide not in the hold, depart, and get thee into the land of Judah.]</hi> The cave, or hold of Adullam, was indeed in the tribe of Judah; but the Lord appoints him not to hide himſelf any longer there, but to go forth abroad and to ſhew himſelf openly in the land of Judah, and that no doubt partly for the triall of his faith, that it might be ſeen, that his confidence was in the Lords protection, and partly that he might by degrees gain eſteem and reſpect amongſt the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Now Saul abode in Gibeah, under a tree in Ramah,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be tranſlated under a tree in a high place (as it is in the margin of our Bibles) and then the meaning of the words is clear, to wit, that Saul was in ſome hill or high place in Gibeah, but according to that tranſlation which is here in our Bibles, <hi>Saul abode in Gibeah, under a tree in Ramah:</hi> it may be queſtioned how it can be ſaid, that he was in Gibeah, and in Ramah too; and no other anſwer can be given, but that Ramah, or the land about it, was in the territories of Gibeah, and ſo becauſe he was under a tree in, or near unto Ramah, it is ſaid that he was <hi>in Gibeah, under a tree in Ramah;</hi> as for that clauſe which next follows, <hi>having his ſpear in his hand,</hi> this is added either, firſt, to imply how full of iealouſies and fears Saul was, as one that had ſcarce any confidence, in any that were about him, he had ſtill his Javelin or his ſpear in his hand; or ſecondly, to intimate that he had muſtered his forces, and was ready to go forth in the purſuit of David, or thirdly, becauſe in thoſe times, kings were wont to uſe ſpears in ſtead of Sceptres, as the Enſigne of their
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42229:163"/>
Regall powers, which is indeed expreſſely affirmed in many humane Authours.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Heare now ye Benjamites, Will the ſonne of Jeſſe give every one of you fields and vineyards,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as I have done, and am ready ſtill to do; and thus he puts them in mind that David was not able to preferre them as he was, nor yet likely to do it if he were able, becauſe David was not of their tribe as he was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>There is none that ſheweth me that my ſonne hath made a league with the ſonne of Jeſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe David (as he had heard) was returned into the land, and Jonathan ſince that diſpleaſure taken, chap. 20.24. had perhaps forborn to come into his preſence; he ſuſpects there was ſome conſpiracie betwixt David and him (as thinking that David durſt not elſe have entered the land, having no greater a power then he had) and condemnes his followers for not revealing it to him, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the more therewith to affect them, what an odious thing it was, that his own ſonne and ſervant, ſhould conſpire againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then anſwered Doeg the Edomite, which was ſet over the ſervants of Saul,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, over his herdmen: ſee the note chap. 21.7. the bait of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Saul had caſt forth in the foregoing verſes, this profane Edomite quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſnapped at, and thereupon accuſed Ahimelech to Saul.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And he enquired of the Lord for him, and gave him victuals,</hi> &amp;c.] Which Ahimelech acknowledged, verſ, 15, but whileſt Doeg told Saul this, like a malicious wretch, he ſpoke not a word to him of Davids excuſe, wherewith Ahime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech was deceived, whence are thoſe words of David, Pſal. 52.2, 3. <hi>Thy tongue deviſeth miſchief like a ſharp Raſour, working deceitfully, thou loveſt evil more then good, and lying rather then to speak righteouſneſſe:</hi>) for that Pſalme was compoſed upon this occaſion, as is evident by the title: <hi>A pſalme of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and ſaid unto him, David is come to the houſe of Ahimelech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And Saul ſaid, Heare now thou ſonne of Ahitub.]</hi> So he calls him by way of contempt, as when they called David the ſon of Jeſſe, in a way of ſleighting him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15, <hi>Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? Be it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>arre from me.</hi> &amp;c.] That is, this was not the firſt time that I have enquired of the Lord for him; and what I have done without blame at other times, what cauſe had I to queſtion the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it now? ſo that it is clear that I intended no ſuch evil in this as is now ſuſpected; had I done it now onely (when it ſeems there was ſome jealouſie of David) it had been another matter; but to intend the aiding of one that ſhould riſe up againſt my Lord and Sovereigne, was never in my heart, <hi>be it farre from me,</hi> ſaith he, that is, God forbid I ſhould have ſuch a thought in my heart.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And the king ſaid, Thou ſhalt ſurely die Ahimelech, thou and all thy fathers houſe.]</hi> Thus he that was ſo pitifull, that he would needs ſpare Agag, whom God had commanded him to deſtroy, was now ſo hard hearted, that he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand eighty and five of the Lords Prieſts to be ſlain in his ſight: and afterwards the citie to be deſtroyed, and all that was in it, old and young, and never be troubled at it.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And it came to paſſe, when Abiathar the ſonne of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an Ephod in his hand.]</hi> Which was more then if many thouſand ſouldiers had come to David; for this bringing of the Ephod to him, was a viſible pledge, that God had totally forſaken Saul, and would be with him to direct him in all his wayes: yea, and ſome conceive alſo, that this is here the rather expreſſed, to let us know how David enquired of the Lord, as in the foregoing verſes, it is twice ſaid he did, namely, by the preiſts wearing the Ephod, according to the judgement of Urim and Thummim: for by Abiathars coming to David to Keilah, they underſtand onely that he came to David when he was near about Keilah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And David knew that Saul ſecretly practiſed miſchief against him.]</hi> This word <hi>ſecretly</hi> makes it manifeſt that though Saul <hi>called the people together to beſiege David &amp; his men,</hi> as it is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, that is, with a purpoſe ſo to imploy them, yet he did not openly profeſſe that, but pretended, he raiſed thoſe forces to fight againſt the Philiſtines.</p>

This no doubt ſorely wounded Davids heart, that his own brethren of the tribe of Judah ſhould deal thus treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with him. But therefore we ſee that God had immediately before this triall, ſent Jonathan to comfort him, and ſtrengthen his hand in God, ver. 16. that ſo he might be the better able to endure it, as captains uſe to encourage their ſouldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fight, and as Phyſicians uſe to give ſome preparative before ſharper phyſick, that it may not be too tedious and hard to be born: and indeed, that David did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf now with hope in Gods promiſes, is evident by the 54. Pſalme, which he compoſed at this time, as appears by the expreſſe words of the title of that Pſalme; <hi>A Pſalme of David when the Ziphims came and ſaid to Saul, Doth not David hide himſelf with us?</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Saul went in to cover his feet.]</hi> Concerning this phraſe of <hi>Sauls covering his feet,</hi> ſee the note, Judg. 3.24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And David and his men remained in the ſides of the cave.]</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange that David and his ſix hundred men chap. 23 13. could be in this cave, and yet Saul when he came into it ſhould not perceive it; but it is well known by the teſtimony of many writers, that in ſome countreys there are ſuch huge caves, that many ſouldiers may lie within them; as alſo that thoſe that are in ſuch caves, may ſee what is done in the mouth of thoſe caves, when they which are at the entrance, perceive not what is within, and ſuch a cave was this, wherein David and his men had hid themſelves, that Saul might not find them out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:42229:165"/>Verſ. 4. <hi>Behold the day of which the Lord ſaid unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand,</hi> &amp;c.] There might be ſome particular promiſe, though it be no where expreſſed in the ſtory, which David had received from Gad, or Samuel, or which God had immediately by his ſpirit given him, concerning Sauls falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Davids hands, of which his followers did now put him in mind; but becauſe ſuch a promiſe might imply, that the Lord intended David ſhould cut off Saul, it ſeems moſt probable that this word of the Lord which they ſpake of, was onely either that promiſe which Samuel had made him concerning the kingdome; or elſe ſome generall promiſe, that he ſhould prevail over all his enemies, which they now reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further then God intended them; as if the promiſe of conferring the kingdome upon David did by conſequence imply, that he might take away his life that now ſtood in his way to keep him from it; or the promiſe of prevailing over his enemies, did include this of putting him to death, if God ſhould deliver him into his power. At leaſt from this act of Gods providence in bringing Saul into his power, they ſought to perſwade David that God intended he ſhould be cut off, and that David ſhould wilfully deſpiſe Gods favour to him, if he ſhould not do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then David aroſe, and cut off the skirt of Sauls garment privily.]</hi> To wit, that he might thereby afterward make it evident to Saul, that he could as well have killed him. But how could he do this and Saul not perceive it? I anſwer, firſt, conſidering the tumult of the ſouldiers without might drown the noiſe within, it is probable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that David might in this dark cave ſteal behind Saul, and cut off the outward lap of his garment, without being felt or perceived: Secondly, if Saul came in to eaſe himſelf, it is likely he had laid aſide his upper robe or garment, to which David might go cloſely, and uneſpied might cut off the skirt of it: but thirdly, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe foregoing words, that <hi>Saul went into the cave to cover his feet,</hi> of his going in to lie down and ſleep there, then there can be no more queſtion made how David ſhould cut off the lap of his garment and yet Saul never feel him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And he ſaid unto his men, The Lord forbid that I ſhould do this thing unto my Maſter,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, when they provoked him to lay hands upon Saul, ver. 10. which indeed was a great proof of his ſincerity, that rather then he would do this, he would venture the diſpleaſing and enraging of all his followers; who were like doubtleſſe to be highly offended, that he would wilfully neglect this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to put an end to all their dangers and fears.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Wherefore heareſt thou mens words, ſaying, Behold David ſeeketh thy hurt?]</hi> Thus David did with great wiſdome, caſt the blame of Sauls violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, rather upon Sauls wicked counſel, and thoſe flatterers about him, that did daily incenſe him againſt David by their falſe ſlanders, then upon Saul himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Moreover, my father, See,</hi> &amp;c.] David calls Saul <hi>father,</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had indeed married his daughter, or becauſe it was a title uſually given to kings, as the fathers of the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>The Lord judge between me and thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus David referred his cauſe to God, and hereby alſo it is evident, that this it was that did comfort David againſt Sauls injuries, and made him patiently bear the wrong he did him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him at this time from avenging himſelf upon Saul, namely, that he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that God was the judge of all; and that he would therefore certainly plead
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42229:166"/>
his cauſe and take occaſion ſooner or later to revenge the injuries that he had ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>As ſaith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedneſſe proceedeth from the wicked, but mine hand ſhall not be upon thee.]</hi> By alledging this proverb, David in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated: firſt, that a good man could not allow himſelf to do that which a wicked wretch would make no conſcience to do: ſecondly, that though wicked men may counſel &amp; adviſe to do that which is evil, yet a good man would not hearken to that counſel: and thirdly, that though unconſcionable men deal wickedly with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſervants of God, yet the righteous will not thence take liberty to deal wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them: So that ſummarily this is the drift of this proverb, that no example, nor perſwaſion, nor provocation of wicked men, ſhould winne the ſervants of God to draw the ſame guilt upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 14. <hi>After whom doſt thou purſue, after a dead dog, after a flea?]</hi> That is, after a man of no eſtimation, nor power, one not worthy thy jealouſies and fears; but beſides, it may be that David had alſo reſpect in theſe words to his humble deportment of himſelf, hitherto free from all ambition: had he made a partie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Nobles or Elders of Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there had been ſome pretence of ſuſpecting him; but conſidering his lowly carriage of himſelf all the time he had been in Sauls court, Sauls proceeding againſt him in that manner he did, was as if a man ſhould have come with an army of ſouldiers againſt a flea, or againſt a dead dog.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Saul went home: But David and his men gat them up unto the hold.]</hi> Namely of Engedi, verſ. 1. having found David and his men hemmed up in a cave, it was much that Saul would overſlip ſuch an opportunitie to put an end to his fears; but his conſcience was ſtrongly convinced, and thereby God carried him away, and hereby David found, that his confidence in God manifeſted in the 57. Pſalme, was not in vain; for that Pſalme was penned, as is moſt probable, when he hid himſelf in this cave, as we may gather from the title, <hi>Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.</hi>

Firſt, becauſe he had now provided a liberall feaſt, out of which he might well ſpare them ſomewhat. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a day of rejoycing, at which times mens hearts are freer to give, and ſo thence he concludes, <hi>Give I pray thee whatſoever cometh to thine hand,</hi> that is, whatſoever thou thinkeſt good to beſtow upon us.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>They ſpake to Nabal according to all thoſe words in the name of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and ceaſed.]</hi> Theſe laſt words, <hi>and ceaſed,</hi> are added to imply, that this before mentioned was all they ſaid; they were neither importunate, nor inſolent in their ſpeeches; but in a fair manner ſpake what David had given them in charge, and then they had done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>There be many ſervants now adayes that break away, every man from his maſter.]</hi> Herein covertly he upbraids David. Firſt, for flying from the king his maſter, and ſtanding out in rebellion againſt him. And ſecondly, for giving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to fugitive ſervants, that were run away from their Lords and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And David ſaid unto his men, Gird you on every man his ſword.]</hi> As having vowed to go immediately to Nabals houſe, and there utterly to deſtroy both Nabal and his family, for ſo much is afterwards expreſſed, ver. 21, 21. Indeed this was a bloudy and unlawfull vow as himſelf afterwards confeſſed, for it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to him to revenge himſelf upon thoſe that had wronged him; and beſides, Nabals churliſhnes and baſe covetouſneſſe were not ſins to be puniſhed with death, much leſſe were his innocent family to be ſlain for his offence: But David was now in a fury and rage, even he that could with ſuch wonderfull patience endure all the wrongs that Saul had done him, could not now over-maſter his paſſions, but being exceedingly enflamed with wrath, nothing would ſatisfie him but the death of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, and all his family.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>She came down by the covert of the hill, and behold, David and his men came down againſt her,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſhe came down in a hollow way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by reaſon of the covert of the hills, ſhe could neither ſee David and his men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>So &amp; more alſo do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, let the Lord deal with mine enemies, as I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in performing what I have reſolved on, not to leave any alive that belong to Nabal, by the morning light, to wit, either by proſpering them if I do it not, or by deſtroying them together with Nabal if I do it. According to the ordinary manner of uſing this form of imprecation, the curſe ſhould have been wiſhed upon himſelf, <hi>So and more alſo do God unto me, if I leave,</hi> &amp;c. as we ſee Ruth 1.17. concerning which ſee the note there: But naturally men are loth to pronounce a curſe upon themſelves, which happely cauſed David rather in the imprecation to mention his enemies (as we ſee in theſe times what ſtrange expreſſions in their execrations ſome men will uſe, even out of a naturall lothneſſe to curſe themſelves, <hi>Would I might never ſwear, As I hope to be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi>) but by this means Davids ſpeech is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confuſedly intricate, and his meaning not ſo clearly expreſſed: as for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>any that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon me my Lord, upon me, let this iniquity be.]</hi> Thus by deſiring that his diſpleaſure might fall upon none but her, whoſe innocencie and ſolicitous care to ſatisfie his deſires he might clearly ſee, ſhe doth in a ſweet and elegant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſeek to ſave her whole family from the revenge he had reſolved upon; for her innocencie and ſimplicity ſhe knew would ſecure her, that he would not puniſh her that had not deſerved it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>For as his name is, ſo is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him.]</hi> Herein ſhe would imply, that he was not worthy of Davids anger, and therefore not to be regarded; for wiſemen alwayes judge the contempt and reproches of children and fools not worth the minding.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to ſhed bloud, and from avenging thy ſelf.]</hi> That is, ſeeing God by his providence hath ſent me forth to ſtay thee from ſeeking thine own revenge, (which ſhe puts him in mind of, as a ſtrong inducement to appeaſe his wrath.) <hi>Now let thy enemies and they that ſeek evil to my Lord, be as Nabal:</hi> that is, thou giving over thine own quarrell, may all thine enemies be as vild and hatefull to God and man, as weak and unable to hurt thee, and as ſure to be puniſhed by the hand of God, as Nabal is, or as thou didſt intend Nabal ſhould have been. So that one principall thing implyed in theſe words, I conceive is this, that if David would commit his cauſe to God, and not take revenge on Nabal himſelf, then God would certainly do it for him: as we ſee indeed it fell out verſ. 38. when God ſtruck him with ſudden death.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>This bleſſing which thy handmaid hath brought unto my Lord, let it even be given unto the young men,]</hi> Herein ſhe modeſtly extenuates the worth of her gift as no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely that having laid this ground, ſhe might thence inferre what ſhe addes afterwards, verſ. 30.31. to wit, what an advantage it would then be to him, not to have his conſcience riſing upon him for ſhedding innocent bloud, as it would doubtleſſe, if he ſhould ſeek to revenge himſelf as he had determined.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>Yet a man is riſen to purſue thee, and ſeek thy ſoul; but the ſoul of my Lord ſhall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God.]</hi> That is, the Lord ſhall make precious account of thy life, and ſhall carefully preſerve it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are wont to bind up thoſe things in bundles which they are carefull to keep, and ſo lay them up charily, where no body may meddle with them, hence is this expreſſion concerning the provident care of God over David for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his life, <hi>The ſoul of my Lord, ſhall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God;</hi> he was but a man as great as he was, that ſought to cut him off, and that mans rage muſt needs be vain, that ſeeks to deſtroy him, whom the Lord God hath undertaken to preſerve.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>This ſhall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thou ſhalt not have this to trouble thee, <hi>That thou haſt ſhed bloud cauſeleſſe,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo withall, ſhe implies, that if he did go on in his vow, this would be hereafter a continuall vexation to him, and deprive him of all the comfort he might otherwiſe enjoy in the great good that God would do for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then remember thine handmaid.]</hi> That is, remember that which I have ſaid, and think of me accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>His heart died within him, and he became as a ſtone.]</hi> That is, he fell as it were into a ſwoun, and ſo there he lay like a ſtock or ſtone for ten dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the very thinking how near he was to death (upon his wives relation) made his heart to die within him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And wen David heard that Nabal was dead, he ſaid, Bleſſed be the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Though he rejoyced not in the evil that was fallen upon Nabal, yet he could not but rejoyce in the manifeſtation of Gods juſtice upon him in his behalf, and in ſeeing that the Lord had pleaded his cauſe againſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And David ſent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.]</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid would rather ſend then go himſelf, that ſhe might the more freely either grant or denie his ſuit, and that it might be the more evident that he took her not by force and violence.</p>

But there is another expoſition given by others, which is plainer, and ſeems more clearly to be gathered from the text, to wit, that David deſires that the Lord might be appeaſed by ſacrifices, if really it were of him that Saul was ſtirred up againſt David, and of no body elſe: David conſidered that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no enemy urged Saul to theſe courſes, but that it was of God (to wit, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting looſe the evil ſpirit upon him, 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Let them give me a place in ſome town in the countrey,</hi> &amp;c.] Davids aim in this requeſt might be: firſt, that he might have the more freedome for the ſervice of God, and the exerciſe of his religion; and might keep his ſouldiers from being corrupted with the ſinnes of the Philiſtines, eſpecially of their Court-ſinnes: ſecondly, that he might avoid the better the envie of the Philiſtines: for being reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſome obſcure corner of the countrey, where he ſhould be leſſe in their eye, there would not be ſo frequent occaſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:42229:169"/>Verſ. 6. <hi>Then Achiſh gave him Ziklag that day.]</hi> Policie would have adviſed to place him for the better aſſurance in ſome town in the midſt of the land, and not in a town that bordered upon his own countrey, as Ziklag did; but this ſheweth that God had blinded Achiſh for Davids good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah, unto this day.]</hi> Ziklag was long ſince allotted to the tribe of Judah, Joſh. 15.31. and afterwards was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Simeon, Joſh. 19.5. though ever ſince detained by the Philiſtines; but now it came into the poſſeſſion of thoſe to whom God had given it, and was not onely joyned to Judahs portion, but was alſo upon this occaſion deſigned to be for ever after, a part of the Grown-land of the kings of Judah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geſhurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites,</hi> &amp;c.] Under a pretence of invading Judea, he bent his forces another way, and ſmote the Amalekites, and others, which are thought to be the remainders of the Canaanites, to wit, <hi>the Geſhurites,</hi> that is, thoſe that dwelt formerly in Geſhur in Gilead, Joſh. 12.15. <hi>and the Gezrites,</hi> that had dwelt in Gezer, which belonged to Ephraim, Joſh. 16.3, who perhaps at the firſt coming of the Iſraelites, fled thence to the Amalekites, and had ever ſince dwelt amongſt them. And thus he not onely provided for the maintenance of his army, by the ſpoils he took, and deluded Achiſh, who thought he had pillaged the land of Iſrael; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he deſtroyed thoſe accurſed nations, whom God had at firſt appointed to be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and continued ſtill enemies to the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And David ſaid, Againſt the ſouth of Judah, and against the ſouth of the Jerahmeelites, and against the ſouth of the Kenites.]</hi> It cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that David pretended the invaſion of ſo many places in one day. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore of this paſſage muſt needs be this, That when ever Achiſh asked him that queſtion; <hi>Whither have ye made a rode to day?</hi> he anſwered, ſometimes that he made a rode againſt the ſouth of Judah; and ſometimes again, that he had made a rode againſt the ſouth of Jerahmeelites (who were a particular family of the tribe of Judah, 1. Chron. 2.9.25.) and ſometimes alſo againſt the ſouth of the Kenites; and thus he either told Achiſh again and again many deliberate lies, to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his from danger; or at leaſt he purpoſely deceived Achiſh with the ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his words (which ill-became ſo good a man) intending that Achiſh ſhould underſtand him, that he had invaded the ſouth parts of Judah, &amp;c. whereas he meant he had invaded thoſe bordering countreys that lay ſouth-ward of Judah, and of the Jerahmeelites, and of the Kenites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Leſt they ſhould tell on us,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe theſe nations were tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries to Achiſh, or at leaſt his confederates and neighbours. It is ſtrange indeed how theſe things could be concealed from the Philiſtines: but firſt, we muſt conſider that the people ſmitten dwelt ſomewhat farre from the Philiſtines, and ſcattered in ſeverall places of a ſolitary wilderneſſe; and ſecondly, there might be ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hand of God in concealing theſe things for Davids ſafety.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THe Philiſtines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight against Iſrael.]</hi> That is, not onely Achiſh, but with him all the other Princes of the Philiſtines, encouraged no doubt by the diſtractions that were now in the land of Iſrael, and the weak ſtate of the kingdome by means hereof.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And David ſaid to Achiſh, Surely thou ſhalt know what thy ſervant can do.]</hi> The ambiguity of theſe words ſeems to imply, that he meant not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people of God, though he durſt not but make ſemblance of being readie to do what the king ſhould require.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Now Samuel was dead,</hi> &amp;c.] This is here inſerted becauſe of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtory, wherein is related how Saul being deſtitute of all counſell, ſought to have Samuel raiſed from the dead, that he might talk with him; of late Saul diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Samuel, now he would have wiſhed he had been living.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Saul put away thoſe that had familiar ſpirits, and the wizards, out of the land.]</hi> This is added to ſhew, that Saul ſeeking to the witch, ſinned againſt his own conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the Philiſtines gathered themſelves together, and came, and pitched in Shunem.]</hi> A town in the border of Iſſachar, Joſh. 19.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And when Saul ſaw the hoſt of the Philiſtines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.]</hi> Through the terrours of a guilty conſcience, which now ſeized upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord anſwered him not,</hi> &amp;c.] How Saul enquired of the Lord it is not expreſſed, onely this we may conclude that by Urim he could not enquire of God, &amp; that becauſe Abiathar had carried away the high prieſts Ephod to David, wherein the Urim was, chap. 23.6. onely becauſe the holy Ghoſt would the more fully expreſſe the comfortleſſe condition of Saul, how wholly he was forſaken of God, and left deſtitute of all direction from him; amongſt other wayes, whereby he could have no anſwer from God, this of the Urim is alſo put in; <hi>the Lord anſwered him not, neither by dreams nor by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim:</hi> to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Urim was now with David, and not with him. Moſt probable it is, that Saul enquired of God, partly by prayer, partly by conſulting with the prieſts and Prophets: for it is evident in ſeverall places of this hiſtory, that there were at this time divers Colledges of Prophets in the land, and like enough it is, that though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had killed Gods prieſts, and deſpiſed his Prophets, yet now in his diſtreſſe he was glad to ſeek both to prieſts and Prophets, to try if they could adviſe him, or would enquire of God in his behalf; but however, by what means ſoever he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it was not done in faith (for had he ſought in faith, he would have continued ſeeking, and not have given over to run to a witch) and therefore, 1. Chron. 10.14. it is ſaid, that <hi>he enquired not of the Lord:</hi> and accordingly we ſee the Lord dealt with him; the Lord anſwered him not, neither one way nor other, which was an evidence that the Lord was highly diſpleaſed with him; for the like is mentioned we
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42229:170"/>
ſee elſewhere, as a great argument of Gods high indignation againſt his people, Lam. 2.9. <hi>The Law is no more, her Prophets alſo find no viſion from the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Then ſaid Saul to his ſervants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems that in thoſe dayes women, by reaſon of their weakneſſe, were moſt deceived by Sathan, and brought to give themſelves to ſorcery and witchcraft; and therefore he commanded his ſervants to ſeek him out a woman that had a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not doubting but there were ſtill ſome of theſe, that lurked ſecretly in the land, though he had endeavoured to root them all out, verſ. 3. and this is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as the laſt, and moſt deſperate wickedneſſe that he fell into, and upon which he was immediately cut off by Gods revenging hand, as is fully expreſſed, 1. Chron. 10, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold there is a woman hath a familiar ſpirit at Endor.]</hi> A town of the Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites within Jordan, Joſh. 17.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And Saul diſguiſed himſelf, and put on other raiment,</hi> &amp;c.] This he did not onely that the witch might not know him, and ſo not fear to ſatisfie his deſire, but alſo doubtleſſe out of very ſhame, becauſe he now yielded to make uſe of thoſe baſe courſes, which himſelf ere while, had ſo ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Behold thou knoweſt what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off thoſe that have familiar ſpirits,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus is Saul put in mind (even by the words of the witch, though ſhe intended it not) how hainouſly he now ſinned, in ſeeking to the devil for help, even againſt the light of his own conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>As the Lord liveth, there ſhall no puniſhment happen to thee for this thing.]</hi> That is, I will not diſcover thee.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And he ſaid, Bring me up Samuel.]</hi> Saul deſpiſed Samuel when he lived, and would not follow his direction, and now his thoughts could be ſatisfied with nothing, but to ſpeak with Samuel, and rather then fail herein, he would go to a witch to raiſe up the Ghoſt of Samuel to talk with him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And when the woman ſaw Samuel, ſhe cried out with a loud voice,</hi> &amp;c.] It was not doubtleſſe Samuel himſelf that appeared now to the Witch, but the devil in Samuels likeneſſe: for firſt, the ſouls of Saints departed, are preſently at reſt with God, and are taken up when they die, out of the devils reach, he hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the ſpirits of Gods faithfull ſervants departed; for then he would abuſe the ſouls of the dead at his pleaſure to deceive the living: ſecondly, it is no way likely that the Lord, who had ſo lately refuſed to anſwer Saul by the Prophets, would now raiſe up Samuel from the dead to anſwer him: we ſee what was ſaid in a like caſe to the rich man in hell: Luke 16.31. <hi>If they heare not Moſes, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, neither will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead:</hi> thirdly, even the mantle wherein he appeared verſ. 14. was an evident ſigne, that all was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit; for did Samuel think we, carry his mantle with him into heaven, or into the grave? fourthly, had the Prophet Samuel been ſent of God (which is the onely evaſion the Papiſts have to maintain this errour; the witch, they ſay, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure him up, but God ſent him to appear to Saul) he would never have ſaid as this counterfeit Samuel did, ver. 15. that the witch by Sauls means had raiſed him up, <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>haſt thou diſquieted me to bring me up?</hi> It was therefore doubtleſſe, by the witches inchantments that this Samuel was raiſed, and conſequently it was not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42229:171"/>
indeed, but the devil in Samuels likeneſſe, and therefore called Samuel here: <hi>when the woman ſaw Samuel,</hi> &amp;c. and that it was that made her cry out ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him: when the devil was raiſed, it ſeems according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner, the witch was preſently poſſeſſed vvith a ſpirit of divination, and hereby knevv Saul, for vvhom ſhe had done this, and hereupon cried out, as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending he vvas come to enſnare her; that having diſcovered her he might put her to death: <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>haſt thou deceived me? For thou art Saul:</hi> all vvhich ſhevvs plainly, that the Authour of that Apocryphall book of Ecccleſiaſticus, vvrote not by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, vvho ſaith of Samuel (as in relation to this hiſtory) chap. 46.20. <hi>After his death he prophecied, and ſhew the king his end,</hi> &amp;c,</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And the king ſaid unto her, be not afraid for what ſawest thou?]</hi> Hereby it appears, that Saul ſaw not the apparition at the firſt, though afterward he was admitted to the ſight of it; and that happely, becauſe the woman was at firſt apart by her ſelf, as witches indeed uſe not to be ſeen when they work their feats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the woman ſaid unto Saul, I ſaw gods aſcending out of the earth.]</hi> This ſhe ſpake, either becauſe he appeared in ſuch an attire, &amp;c. that ſhe might eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it was ſome Magiſtrate, or perſonage of great eminencie and worth, and ſuch are called Gods, Pſalme 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods:</hi> or elſe, becauſe this evil ſpirit, now a counterfeit Samuel, did riſe up with ſuch a divine kind of ſplendour and brightneſſe; as we know he can change himſelf into an Angel of light, 2. Cor. 11.14. That the poore woman unacquainted with ſuch apparitions, was even aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with beholding it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And Saul perceived it was Samuel, and he ſtooped,</hi> &amp;c.] Saul at length is admitted to the ſight of this counterfeit Samuel, though it ſeems he were not by, when the witch firſt conjured him up, verſ. 12.13. and ſo Saul addreſſing himſelf to enquire of this infernall prophet, the witch it ſeems withdrew her ſelf, as appears, verſ. 21, where it is afterwards ſaid, <hi>The woman came unto Saul, and ſaw that he was ſore troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the Lord hath done to him as he ſpake by me.]</hi> That is, to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; the man to whom the Lord hath betaken his favourable preſence ſince he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thee.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Becauſe thou obeyedſt not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce wrath on Amalek,</hi> &amp;c.] When Saul was in conſultation about ſparing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag the Amalekite, the devil no doubt then ſuggeſted whatever might encourage and embolden him thereto, but now, when he come to be affrighted with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods wrath, even that fact of his he alledged againſt him, thereby to adde to his terrours, and to drive him to deſpair, and that under a colour of ſpeaking as a Samuel.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And to morrow ſhalt thou and thy ſonnes be with me.]</hi> That is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye ſhall be ſlain, and ſo not be any longer amongſt the living, but with me amongſt the dead: But how came the devil to be of Gods counſell, that he can ſo certainly determine the period of their lives? I anſwer, firſt, that the devil can and doth many times by ſtrong conjectures foretell many future things, which accordingly come to paſſe. Secondly, that he doth not here define the time of their death cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, but ſpeaks darkly and deceitfully: for <hi>to morrow</hi> doth not onely ſignifie the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42229:171"/>
day immediately following, but alſo, the time to come indefinitely, Exod. 13.14. <hi>And it ſhall be when thy ſonne asketh thee in time to come, (or to morrow) what is this, thou ſhalt ſay unto him,</hi> &amp;c. and Matth. 6.34. <hi>Take therefore no thought for the morrow,</hi> &amp;c.) as indeed it ſeems it was not the very next day, that Saul and his ſonnes fell before the Philiſtines: and ſo we ſee in another particular, he ſpeaks ambiguouſly, <hi>Thou and thy ſonnes ſhall be with me,</hi> which might either be meant of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their dying onely, as ſpoken with reſpect to Samuel, or of being with Sathan; and then that as concerning Jonathan we are ſure he lyed groſſely; but thus will the devil ſtill preach comfort to thoſe at laſt that will not away with the preaching of Gods prophets, when they ſharply reprove them for their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 21. <hi>And the woman came unto Saul and ſaw that he was ſore troubled,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby it appears, that the witch had withdrawn her ſelf, whilſt Saul and her familiar ſpirit, then Samuels counterfeit, had been talking together.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the Amalekites had invaded the ſouth and Ziklag, and ſmitten Ziklag, and burnt it with fire.]</hi> That is, they had invaded the ſouth of Judah, and of the Philiſtines countrey, and amongſt the reſt particularly they had ſacked Ziklag, and deſtroyed it with fire; for ſo we find this place explained after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ver. 14. where the Egyptian they took confeſſeth to David, <hi>We made an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the ſouth of the Cherethites</hi> (that is, the Philiſtines) <hi>and upon the coaſt which belongeth to Judah, and upon the ſouth of Caleb, &amp;c.</hi> This no doubt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites did, to revenge the ſpoyl which David and his men had made in their countrey, chap. 27.8, taking the opportunity of doing it at this time, when the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines and Davids men were gone out to make an invaſion into the land of Iſrael. But God had herein a further end; for by this means, firſt, David was chaſtened for his ſinnes, who out of his diſtruſt of Gods promiſes and providence, had ſought to help himſelf by unlawfull means, by fleeing to the Philiſtines, by lying and diſſembling, and now of late by pretending to Achiſh that he had a deſire to fight againſt Saul, and againſt the Iſraelites: ſecondly, his faith was exceedingly tried; for never was he in greater ſtraights then he was at this time: thirdly, the Amalekites Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, were ſmitten with a great deſtruction: and fourthly, David was indeared to his own people, when there was moſt need of it, becauſe they were now immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42229:172"/>
to receive him to be their king, both by the fame of his victory, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents he ſent them, verſ. 26. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And had taken the women captives, that were therein; they ſlew not any,</hi> &amp;c.] And this no doubt was of God, that they might by David be recovered again; for otherwiſe how unlikely a thing was it, that they ſhould be ſo carried away with a covetous deſire to make a gain of them, by keeping them priſoners; that they ſhould not think of uſing theſe that were now in their power, as David and his ſouldiers had a while before uſed them, chap. 27.8, 9. <hi>And David ſmote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And Davids two wives were taken captives,</hi> &amp;c.] This is inſerted, firſt, to ſet forth in what a ſad condition David was at preſent: ſecondly, to ſhew how wholly he ſubmitted himſelf to the will of God, that could depend upon Gods direction, whether he ſhould purſue the Amalekites or no, verſ. 8. notwithſtanding, that his wives that were ſo precious in his eyes, were by them carried away.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And David was greatly distreſſed; for the people spake of ſtoning him,</hi> &amp;c.] As laying all the blame upon him: firſt, becauſe he had provoked the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites by ſpoiling their countrey, chap. 27.8. ſecondly, becauſe he had now to no purpoſe carryed them all away after Achiſh, and left the citie without any defence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But David incouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.]</hi> David was at this time in great diſtreſſe; his wives were taken captives to Achiſh, he durſt not return, (for he would have been inraged at him for the loſſe of Ziklag, burnt by the Amalekites in revenge of his former inrodes upon them) to flie to Saul was in vain; for he was his deadly enemy, and at this time invaded by the Philiſtines; yea his town followers began to ſpeak of ſtoning him. But though all this were ſo, yet now David raiſed up his heart, by remembring the power and the goodneſſe and the promiſes of God, and ſo by this means he incouraged himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>For two hundred abode behind, which were ſo faint that they could not go over the brook Beſor.]</hi> And theſe therefore David left with the carriages, that with the other <hi>foure hundred</hi> he might the more ſpeedily purſue the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites, as we ſee, verſ. 24. And thus the Lord both tried the faith of David, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving him of the third part of his forces, when he was to go againſt an enemy that had a mighty great army: (for there fled away as many of the Amalekites, as David had in all with him, to wit, <hi>foure hundred,</hi> verſ. 17.) and withall, he made it the more manifeſt, that the victory which afterward they obtained, was of him; and not of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11, <hi>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus the Lord by his providence provided a guide for David, to lead him readily to the enemies whom he now purſued; and withall puniſhed the inhumane cruelty of that Amalekite, who had in ſo barbarous a manner caſt off this his ſick ſervant, by making that very ſervant the means of bringing deſtruction upon the whole army.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>We made an invaſion upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb.]</hi> By the Cherethites are meant the Philiſtines, verſ. 16. <hi>They were eating, and drinking, and dancing, Becauſe of all the great ſpoil which they had taken out of the land of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,</hi>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:42229:173"/>
&amp;c. Some part of the land of the Philiſtines was it ſeems called Cherith, and thence the Philiſtines are in ſeverall places of Scripture called Cherethims or Cherethites, as Ezek. 25.15, 16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Becauſe the Philiſtines have dealt by revenge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will ſtretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims,</hi> &amp;c. So again in Zeph. 2, 5. Where plainly judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is denounced againſt the Philiſtines under theſe words, <hi>Wo unto the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſea coasts, the nation of the Cherethites.</hi> And for <hi>the ſouth of Caleb,</hi> thereby is meant the ſouth of Judah belonging to Calebs poſterity, Joſh. 14.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And I will bring thee down to this company.]</hi> Hereby it appears, that this Egyptian had heard them ſay where they meant to encamp; yea, perhaps they had told him, that if he recovered he might come to them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And David ſmote them from the twilight, even unto the evening of the next day.]</hi> That is, from the evening when he came upon them to the evening of the next day. Some think it was onely from the twilight of the morning unto the evening, (which was the beginning of the next day.) But it is evident, that David began to ſmite them when they were eating and drinking and dancing, &amp;c. and it is more likely that this was in the evening, then ſo early in the morning.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20, <hi>And David took all the flocks and the heards which they drave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other cattell, and ſaid, This is Davids ſpoil.]</hi> That is, he took all the flocks and the heards which the Amalekites had taken from other places, and not from Ziklag: He did not onely recover all which they had carried away from Zik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag, as it is ſaid in the former verſe; but beſides, he took all the cattell which they had driven away from other places. And theſe the ſouldiers drave before thoſe other cattell which belonged to the inhabitants of Ziklag, and extolled David as they went along (even the ſame men that ere while had ſpoken of ſtoning him) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that it was of him that they had gotten this great booty; for that is the meaning of theſe words, <hi>This is Davids ſpoil.</hi> Songs of triumph they ſung as they went along, and the foot of their ſong was ſtill, <hi>This is Davids ſpoil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Becauſe they went not with us we will not give them of the ſpoil,</hi> &amp;c.] This was the baſe reſolution of ſome of thoſe, that had with David vanquiſhed the Amalekites, concerning thoſe two hundred of their brethren that had ſtaid behind at the brook Beſor; for which they are termed in the foregoing words <hi>wicked men and men of Belial.</hi> Though firſt, it was not cowardiſe, but mere faintneſſe and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe that made thoſe men ſtay behind: and ſecondly, in ſtaying behind with the carriages to defend the ſtuff, and in being in a readineſſe to aid their fellows, had they been forced to retire, they did good ſervice as well as the other: yet ſo partiall were they in their own cauſe, that they would have had all the ſpoyl, and theſe their brethren muſt have nothing but onely their wives and children again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Then ſaid David, You ſhall not do ſo, my brethren, with that which the Lord hath given us,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid. The Lord hath given us the victory, and we ſhould ill repay the Lord for this mercy, if we ſhould aſcribe ſo much to our ſelves, as upon that ground to deal ſo injuriouſly with our brethren. It is the very ſame argument which our Saviour uſeth, <hi>Freely you have received, freely give,</hi> Matth. 10.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>For who will hearken unto you in this matter?]</hi> In theſe words David
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42229:173"/>
implies, that this which they deſired was ſo unequall, that they would ſcarce find any body of their mind; every body that ſhould heare of it, would blame them for it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And it was ſo from that day forward, that he made it a ſtatute, and an ordinance,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that the ſpoyl of warre ſhould be equally divided betwixt thoſe that fought with the enemy, and thoſe that ſtayed with the ſtuff. And indeed in making this ordinance, David had not onely the clear light of nature to direct him, but alſo a preſident of the Lords own preſcribing, Numb. 31.26, 27. <hi>Take the ſumme of the prey that was taken, &amp;c. And divide the prey into two parts, between them, who took the warre upon them, who went out to battell, and between all the congregation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And when David came to Ziklag, he ſent of the ſpoyl unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends.]</hi> To wit, firſt, by way of reſtitution, becauſe much of this prey had been taken by the Amalekites from the ſouth parts of Judah, v. 14. and ſecondly, by way of thankfulneſſe, becauſe of the many courteſies he had received from them in thoſe places, when Saul hunted him from one place to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this was a good preparation to encline the hearts of men in all places to him at this time: for juſt about this time, Saul and his ſonnes were ſlain by the Philiſtines, and ſo way was made for him to come to the crown.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And to all the places where David himſelf and his men were wont to haunt.]</hi> Whereby it appears, that the Lord provided David ſome friend or other, in every place where he came.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXI.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>ANd the Philistines ſlew Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchiſhua, Sauls ſonnes.]</hi> And thus the Lord did provide, to clear the way the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Davids advancement to the kingdome, that he might have the leſſe trouble by the ſurviving poſterity of Saul: even Jonathan for this cauſe did fall amongſt the reſt; for if Iſhboſheth, a baſe and worthleſſe man, found ſo many of the people ſo ready to ſide with him againſt David; what would they have done for Jonathan, ſo brave and hopefull a Prince, had he out-lived his father? As for Abinadab here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he is alſo called Iſhui, chap. 14.4. and Iſhboſheth Sauls fourth ſonne, it ſeems was left at home, perhaps to take care of the government of the kingdome in Sauls abſence: for God intended by him further to try the faith and patience of David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the battel went ſore againſt Saul, and the archers hit him,</hi> &amp;c.] Saul therefore fell not at the firſt onſet, but for his greater terrour, and ſorer puniſhment, firſt he ſaw the army routed, and his ſons together with many of the people ſlain, &amp; then at laſt he was wounded and purſued ſo cloſely, that there was no hope of eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Draw out thy ſword &amp; thruſt me through therewith, leſt theſe uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed come and thrust me through.]</hi> Thus at the very houre of his death, yea when he was ready to lay violent hands upon himſelf, Saul could deſpiſe the Philiſtines, and ſpeak reprochfully of them, and that becauſe they were uncircumciſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently none of Gods peculiar people, as he was; whereas being ſuch a wicked wretch, his condition was the worſe, becauſe he was circumciſed, and one of Gods peculiar people. No Philiſtine could be ſo bad as he in this regard.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Therefore Saul took a ſword, and fell upon it.]</hi> And thus with the ſword he had drawn againſt David, he ſlew himſelf, the Lord in his juſt judgement giving
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42229:174"/>
him over to this deſperate impatience, whereupon it is ſaid that the Lord ſlew him; 1. Chron. 10.14. <hi>and enquired not of the Lord, therefore he ſlew him, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>So Saul died, and his three ſonnes, and his armour-bearer, and all his men,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, not all his ſouldiers (for many of them fled and eſcaped) but all his houſhold ſervants, and thoſe perhaps too that were the guard of his body.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>They forſook the cities and fled, and the Philiſtines came and dwelt in them.]</hi> That is, ſome of the men of Iſrael the inhabitants of ſome cities <hi>on the other ſide of the valley,</hi> to wit, the valley where this battel was fought; and <hi>on the other ſide of Jordan,</hi> fled out of their cities upon this defeat, and ſo the Philiſtines came and dwelt in their room: Whereby I conceive is meant, that at the preſent they did purſue their victory for a time, and purſuing it took thoſe weaker towns out of which the inhabitants were fled for fear, and then left garriſons in them: for it is not likely that preſently they removed colonies of the Philiſtines to dwell there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And they cut off his head, and ſtript off his armour.]</hi> As David had done to Goliath, chap. 17.54. and 21.9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And they faſtened his body to the wall of Bethſhan.]</hi> His head they put in the temple of Dagon, 1. Chron. 10.10. but <hi>his body</hi> and the bodies of his ſonnes alſo, verſ. 12. <hi>they fastened to the wall of Bethſhan,</hi> that is, to a wall <hi>in the ſtreet of Bethſhan,</hi> 2. Sam. 21.12. a town that belonged to the lot of Manaſſeh, though not yet recovered from the Philiſtines, called alſo Bethſhean, Judg. 1.27.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And when the inhabitants of Jabeſh-Gilead heard of that which the Philiſtines had done to Saul,</hi> &amp;c.] As being thankfully mindfull of that which Saul had done for them, 1. Sam. 11. when he came and helped them againſt the king of the Ammonites that had beſieged their citie: and beſides no doubt the Lord intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little hereby to revive the dead hearts of the poore diſtreſſed Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his ſonnes from the wall of Bethſhan, and came to Jabeſh, and burnt them there.]</hi> This was not the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſe of the Iſraelites; and therefore two reaſons are given for this by Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours: 1. That it was becauſe the fleſh was now corrupt and putrified. 2. Leſt the Philiſtines ſhould again get their bodies into their power.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And they took their bones and buried them under a tree at Jabeſh, and fasted ſeven dayes.]</hi> The fleſh being burnt from off their bones, they gathered up their bones, which would not be ſo ſoon burnt as the fleſh was, and buried them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in Jabeſh; and there they continued till toward the end of Davids reigne, when he took up their bones, and buried them in the ſepulchre of Kiſh the father of Saul, 2. Sam. 21.12. &amp;c. As for their faſting ſeven dayes, to wit, till the evening of each day, when they had thus buried the bones of Saul and his ſonnes, that was done doubtleſſe, not onely by way of bewayling the death of Saul and his ſonnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo eſpecially that they might ſeek unto God in the behalf of the whole land and people of God, who were now in a ſad condition, by reaſon of this great defeat which the Philiſtines had given them. Nor is it neceſſary that we ſhould think that they did neither eat nor drink all theſe ſeven dayes (ſome maſters of Phyſick have concluded, that it muſt needs be mortall to be without all nouriſhment for ſeven daies together) rather we may think that they afflicted themſelves with faſting for ſeven dayes together, onely taking ſtill at night ſome ſmall refreſhing: and yet indeed in thoſe eaſt countreys, they will far longer endure faſting, then we can do in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow it came to paſſe after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the ſlaughter of the Amalekites,</hi> &amp;c.] This book containeth the hiſtory of Davids reigne, who was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God to ſucceed Saul in the kingdome; yet becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ſhown the accompliſhment of Samuels prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kingdom of David, therefore it is called <hi>The ſecond book of Samuel.</hi> And the firſt thing here related is, how the tidings of the death of Saul and his ſonnes were firſt brought unto David, whileſt he was yet in Ziklag. David was lately returned thither from the ſlaughter of the Amalekites, and had been preparing and ſending away preſents to his friends in Judah of the ſpoil he had taken from them; when behold on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their great joy was damped with the ſad tidings of the overthrow of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the death of Saul and his ſonnes, even Jonathan amongſt the reſt, the dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friend of David. And thus though a way was opened for David to come to the crown, yet it was by a ſad calamitie, that muſt needs allay his comfort therein with a great deal of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>A man came out of the camp with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head.]</hi> See the notes, Gen. 37.29. and Joſh. 7.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And David ſaid unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee tell me.]</hi> This eagerneſſe of David to know what had paſſed betwixt the armies of the Iſraelites and the Philiſtines that had invaded their land, diſcovered plainly how ſolicitous he was for his brethren, though he ſojourned at that time in the land of the Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold Saul leaned upon his ſpear,</hi> &amp;c.] By the relation we have of Sauls death in the laſt chapter of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer book, it is evident that Saul killed himſelf, and that many ſeverall paſſages in the relation which this Amalekite here makes of his death, were merely feigned by him, that he might the more ingratiate himſelf to David; For firſt, it is expreſſely ſaid that Sauls armour bearer killed not himſelf till he ſaw that his Lord and maſter was dead, verſ. 5. <hi>When his armour-bearer ſaw that Saul his maſter was dead, he fell likewiſe upon his ſword, and died with him.</hi> Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is no way probable, that after Saul had been firſt ſo ſorely wounded by the Philiſtine archers, that he could not get away from thoſe that purſued him, and then thruſt through by himſelf with his own ſword, he ſhould ſtill be able to talk with the Amalekite. Thirdly, If he were ſo loth to be killed by the uncircumciſed Philiſtines, why ſhould he deſire an uncircumciſed Amalekite to kill him? And fourthly, whereas this Amalekite pretends here, that he was fallen upon his ſpear, which he had thruſt into his body (for ſo thoſe Expoſitours underſtand theſe words, <hi>Saul leaned upon his ſpear,</hi> that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42229:175"/>
hold that this Amalekite killed him) and that therefore he deſired him to ſtand upon him, verſ. 9. to wit, to force the ſpear through his body, that ſo he might die: this could not be, for it is expreſſely ſaid, 1. Sam. 31.4. That Saul thruſt himſelf through with his ſword, and not with a ſpear, <hi>Saul took a ſword and fell upon it;</hi> it ſeems therefore, that this Amalekite lighting upon Saul when he lay dead in the field he apprehended that if he ſhould carry the firſt tydings of Sauls death to David, (who was by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall fame known to be the man whom Samuel had anointed to ſucceed Saul in the throne) and together with thoſe tidings Sauls crown and bracelets, he ſhould not miſſe of ſome fair reward for the preſent, and ſome great preferment afterward; and ſo thereupon, away he went preſently to find out David; onely withall, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that this would endear him the more to David, and make his reward the greater, he reſolved to adde this lie beſides, to wit, that he found him leaning upon his ſpear, as not being able to ſtand, becauſe of the deadly wounds the archers had given him, and being intreated by him to kill him, and ſo to put an end to his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he did what he deſired of him, verſ. 10. <hi>I ſtood upon him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſlew him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Stand I pray thee upon me, and ſlay me, (for anguiſh is come upon me,</hi> &amp;c.] Some tranſlate this laſt branch, as it is in the margine of our bibles, <hi>my coat of male</hi> (or <hi>my embroidered coat) hindereth me that my life is yet whole in me;</hi> and accordingly they conceive, that the reaſon that Saul alledges why he lay in ſuch extremitie and yet could not die, but continued heart whole, as we uſe to ſay, was becauſe his coat of male, or his embroidred coat hindred the ſpear from paſſing through his body, and that thereupon, he deſired this Amalekite to ſtand upon him, to wit, to force the ſpear through him and ſo to ſlay him; but becauſe there is no likelihood that Saul would attempt to kill himſelf in that manner, when he had a coat of male or any other garment on that ſhould hinder the ſpear from piercing through him. I rather approve of that tranſlation in our bibles, <hi>Stand I pray thee upon me and ſlay me, for anguiſh is come upon me,</hi> &amp;c. and then by ſtanding upon him, he meant onely, that he ſhould ſtand over him, and ſlay him, the very ſame that is elſe where expreſſed by a like phraſe of falling upon men to ſlay them, as verſe 15. of this chapter, where David enjoyned one of his young men to ſlay the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite, <hi>David called one of the young men, and ſaid, Go near and fall upon him, and he ſmote him that he dyed.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And they mourned and wept, and faſted untill even for Saul and for Jonathan,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Saul was Davids enemie, and with an implacable hatred did continually perſecute him, yet he was the Lords anointed, and had been a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant defender of Iſrael; and beſides the uncircumciſed enemies of Gods people, were like to inſult over them becauſe of this victorie, and to blaſpheme the name of God; and this grievous calamitie that was fallen upon them was a ſigne of Gods wrath againſt the whole people; and therefore no marvell though David mourned bitterly, not onely for Jonathan, but alſo for Saul and for the people of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13, <hi>And David ſaid unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?</hi> &amp;c.] He had before told David how he had anſwered Saul when he asked him
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42229:175"/>
this very queſtion, to wit, that he was an Amalekite; but it ſeems David diſturbed with the tidings he had brought him, minded it not, and ſo asked him again whence he was, and accordingly, he anſwered again, <hi>I am the ſonne of a ſtranger an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekite,</hi> and lived amongſt the Iſraelites though he were not of that nation.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Alſo he bad them teach the children of Judah the uſe of the bow.]</hi> Beſides, upon occaſion of this heavy overthrow (which made David compoſe this mournfull ditty) wherein Saul and Jonathan were overcome and ſlain by the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers amongſt the Philiſtines, David took order that his people ſhould be taught the uſe of the bow: and perhaps indeed (as ſome think) this might be one end why Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid compoſed this dittie, that being uſed frequently in the tribe of Judah, it might ſtirre them up to labour to be expert in the skill of ſhooting.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you,</hi> &amp;c.] This is alſo a poeticall expreſſion of the great and grievous loſſe of the Iſraelites, in the death of Saul and Jonathan, and of their juſt ſorrow for it; that they had cauſe enough to wiſh, if ſo it might be, that the place where they were ſlain, might for ever be a ſad and dolefull monument of this lamentable accident: it is much like that of Job, chap. 3.3. <hi>Let the day periſh wherein I was born, and the night in which it was ſaid, there is a man-child conceived.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>From the bloud of the ſlain, from the fat of the mighty the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the ſword of Saul turned not empty.]</hi> The ſword in warre is ſaid to devoure in the Scripture phraſe, <hi>Shall the ſword devoure for ever?</hi> ſath Abner to Joab, chap. 2.29. And thence that which is tranſlated <hi>the edge of the ſword,</hi> is in the Hebrew, <hi>the mouth of the ſword,</hi> and in reference to this it is ſaid here, that Jonathans bow, and Sauls ſword <hi>returned not empty from the bloud of the ſlain,</hi> and <hi>from the fat of the mighty,</hi> meaning that they did alwayes devoure the bloud and fleſh of the ſtouteſt enemies; for fat is mentioned to imply men luſty, healthfull, and ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23, <hi>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleaſant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided.]</hi> By this that they were <hi>lovely and pleaſant in their

                  <p>
                     <hi>They were ſwifter then eagles.]</hi> This may be meant, firſt, of their nimbleneſſe and agilitie of body, which is in ſouldiers very commendable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the evading of the ſtroke of an enemy, and for ſtriking home upon them, and eſpecially for the purſuit of them when they are put to flight, though men be never ſo ſtrong, yet if they be lumpiſh and heavie, an active nimble man of leſſe ſtrength may do better ſervice then they: and ſecondly, of their ſpeedy proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting any noble ſervice they had undertaken or reſolved upon, they were not ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but active and quick; and were often upon their enemies before they could well hear any tidings of them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Ye daughters of Iſrael weep over Saul who clothed you in ſcarlet,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, partly by the ſpoils taken from the enemy in his warre, wherein he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes victorious, according to that expreſſion, Pſalme 68.12. <hi>Kings of armies did flee apace, and ſhe that tarried at home divided the ſpoil:</hi> and partly by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his government, under which they grew rich and wealthy; and obſervable it is, that ſpeaking of the rich and coſtly attire wherewith they were enabled to adorn themſelves, through the flouriſhing proſperity they enjoyed under Sauls govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he addreſſed his ſpeech in this to the women of Iſrael. <hi>Ye daughters of Iſrael weep over Saul who clothed you in ſcarlet,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe women are moſt delighted in glorious attire.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>DAvid enquired of the Lord, ſaying, Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah?]</hi> Though David knew that he ſhould be king, and that Saul being now dead, the Diadem, which by Gods ſpeciall providence was put into his hand, belonged unto him; yet where or by what means the Lord would open a way to him, that he might poſſeſſe and enjoy it, he knew not, and therefore for this he enquired of the Lord, to wit, by the Ephod, as formerly, the rather doubtleſſe, becauſe he knew that Gods anſwer herein, would be a great encouragement, both to him and to his followers.</p>

                     <hi>And David ſaid, whither ſhall I go up? And he ſaid unto Hebron.]</hi> This was at preſent the chief citie of the tribe of Judah, and withall it was the place where A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; Iſaac, and Jacob were buried: and thus the kingdome of David was firſt erected where they lay enterred, to whom long ſince the land of Canaan was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, the Sceptre of Chriſt and the kingdome to be eſtabliſhed in the tribe of Judah, which was to be a type of the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>So David went up thither, and his two wives alſo,</hi> &amp;c.] That as they had been ſharers with him in his ſufferings, ſo they might have their ſhare in his proſperity too; and thus they that are married to Chriſt, and partake with him in his ſufferings, ſhall be ſure alſo to partake with him in his glory, Luke 22.28, 29. <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed unto me:</hi> 2. Tim. 2.12. <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reigne with him, if we deny him, he alſo will deny us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.]</hi> That is, in Hebron and the towns and cities adjoyning, in that mountainous tract of land that belonged to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron. See Joſh. 21.11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the houſe of Judah.]</hi> Though many of the other tribes came into David, whileſt he was yet at Ziklag, even ſome that were Sauls brethren, of the tribe of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, 1. Chron. 12.1, 2. &amp; therefore it is likely, that even now too, when he was come to Hebron, ſome of every tribe came in to him, to wit, ſo many as were convinced that David had been anointed by Samuel at Gods appointment, and therefore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſhould rebell againſt God, if they ſhould not ſubmit to his government; yet becauſe the generallity of the other tribes, ſtood for the ſetling of the kingdome upon Sauls poſterity (though indeed they did it at leaſt many of them, becauſe they durſt do no other, for fear of Abner: <hi>Ye ſought for David in times paſt to be king over you,</hi> ſaith Abner to the Iſraelites, chap. 3.17.) And onely the tribe of Judah did generally at this time come into David, therefore it is ſaid, that for the preſent he was onely anointed king over the houſe of Judah. Hitherto David had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely perſecuted by Saul, and had endured a great deal of trouble and ſorrow; but now at laſt God made good his word: and ſettled him in the throne which he had promiſed him; and herein was David a notable type of Chriſt, who through many ſufferings entred into glory, <hi>he endured the croſſe, despiſing the ſhame,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Heb. 12.2. <hi>and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> Yea and the voluntary ſubmiſſion of theſe men to the government of David, was a type of the voluntary ſubmiſſion of Chriſts ſubjects to his Sceptre, according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall expreſſion, Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Indeed this was the very reaſon why they anointed David now again at He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, whereas he had been before anointed by Samuel; namely, that they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by teſtifie their approbation of that which God had appointed, and how freely and cheerfully they did all conſent, to accept of him as their king and ſovereigne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they told David, ſaying, That the men of Jabeſh-Gilead were they that buried Saul.]</hi> It may well be that David made enquiry after the bodies of Saul and his ſonne, as intending to have them honourably buried, and that hereupon he was told what had been herein done, by the men of Jabeſh-Gilead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:42229:177"/>Verſ. 6. <hi>And now the Lord ſhew kindneſſe and truth unto you.]</hi> That is, may the Lord recompence the kindneſſe which you have ſhewed to Saul, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly kind and gracious to you; theſe two words kindneſſe, and truth, are often joyned together in the Scripture, to ſignifie a conſtant ſure hearty kindneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Your maſter Saul is dead, and alſo the houſe of Judah have anointed me king over them.]</hi> This clauſe is added to ſhew the reaſon why he ſent this meſſage to the men of Jabeſh-gilead, to wit, becauſe he was now anointed king in Sauls room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he would not have them entertain any thoughts of jealouſie, that he would bear them any ſpleen for their kindneſſe to Saul, but would rather ſtudy to requite them for it; thus by kindneſſe he ſought to winne the other tribes to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his government.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8 <hi>But Abner the ſonne of Ner, Captain of Sauls hoſt, took Iſhboſheth the ſonne of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that he might there anoint him king, in the room of his father Saul, as it follows in the next verſe. <hi>And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Aſhurites, and over Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel,</hi> (not that of Judah, Joſh. 15.26. but that of Iſſachar, Joſh. 19.18.) <hi>and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Iſrael,</hi> that is, over all the other tribes of Iſrael, except the tribe of Judah, that had anointed David; Abner was Sauls couſin german (for Ner the father of Abner, and Kiſh the father of Saul, were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) and in Sauls time he was the Lord Generall of all his forces, fearing therefore that he ſhould be diſplaced and diſregarded, if David were king, at leaſt that he could not hope for the preferment, and favour under David, that he might expect under a king of his own kindred and family, eſpecially if he were the chief means to make him king, he reſolved to continue the kingdome, if he could in Sauls family; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mephiboſheth Jonathans ſonne, the heir apparant to Saul, was but five years old, and now lately lamed in his feet, chap. 4.4. therefore he rather thought fit to proclaim Iſhboſheth king, who was the onely ſonne of Saul that was now left, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe that he had by his concubines: and to that end he took him, and carried to Mahanaim, which was a citie in Gilead, beyond Jordan in the tribe of Gad, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there at firſt to ſettle his new made king; either becauſe he had heard of the meſſage which David had ſent to the men of Jabeſh-gilead, and ſo deſired to ſtrengthen himſelf in thoſe parts, leſt they ſhould be wonne to fall off to David, or elſe onely becauſe this being one of the remoteſt parts of the kingdome, Iſhboſheth might be here ſafeſt from Davids party. It is indeed evident, that Abner knew well enough that David was anointed by Samuel at Gods appointment, to ſucceed Saul in the throne; for we ſee that afterwards in his anger, he could tell Iſhboſheth, that he would tranſlate the kingdome to David, <hi>even as the Lord had ſworn to him,</hi> chap. 3.9. But what do ambitious Atheſticall men care for Gods command? He conſidered at this time that Iſhboſheth was his near kinſman, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a weak feeble-ſpirited man, he might uſe him as a ſcale, and in the mean time rule all himſelf, and therefore he made no bones in the purſuit of theſe his ambitious deſignes, to ſet up a king contrary to what he knew God had appointed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Iſhboſheth Sauls ſonne, was fourty years old when he began to reigne
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42229:177"/>
over Iſrael, and reigned two years.]</hi> Some therefore conceive, that Iſhboſheth took not the kingdome upon him, till five years after his fathers deceaſe; but I ſhould rather think the meaning of this clauſe is, not that Iſhboſheth reigned but two years in all, but that he had reigned but two years, when Abner led forth an army againſt David, and was overcome by Joab, as is related in the ſequel of the chapter, for had not Iſhboſheth reigned longer then two years, why is it ſaid, chap. 3. verſ. 1. that <hi>there was long warre between the houſe of Saul, and the houſe of David;</hi> and why was it ſeven years and odde moneths, ere the reſt of the tribes accepted of David for their king. Yet ſome Expoſitours hold, that it was above five years after the death of Saul, ere Abner roſe up againſt David, and made Iſhbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth king.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the houſe of Judah followed David.]</hi> To wit, even after the other tribes had made Iſhboſheth king: which is doubtleſſe noted to the praiſe of the men of Judah. They might well aſſure themſelves that if they ſtill ſtuck to David it would make a dangerous rent in the kingdome, and that would prove the occaſion of a civil warre, wherein much bloud was like to be ſhed, and yet becauſe it was of Gods appointment that David ſhould be king, they are commended for this, that they did ſtill hold faſt with David, leaving the event for other things to God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And Abner the ſonne of Ner, and the ſervants of Iſhboſheth the ſonne of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.]</hi> To wit, to make warre againſt David, as is evident in the ſequel of the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And Abner ſaid to Joab, Let the young men now ariſe, and play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, that when both armies were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is before ſaid, Abner ſent a challenge to Joab, to wit, that a certain number of their young gallants on each ſide might come forth, and ſhow both armies ſome paſtime in a fight together; and this no doubt he did in a bravery as hoping by this vaunting flouriſh of the courage of his men, to daunt thoſe that were with Joab; but Joab ſoon accepted the challenge, and ſent forth twelve of his men to enter the liſts with twelve of Abners; and we may well think that the ſad event of this combate was of God, to ſhew how he abhorres ſuch vain-glorious challenges.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And there was a very ſore battel that day.]</hi> Each part happely being enraged by the death of their fellows ſlain in the combate, both armies did preſently with great fury fall upon each other, and ſo there was a ſore battel, though at laſt Joab and his men wonne the field, who fought for David the Lords anointed; as it follows in the next words, <hi>Abner was beaten,</hi> &amp;c. and yet conſidering that Abner had all the tribes of Iſrael on his ſide ſave that of Judah, it is very probable that his army was farre greater then Joabs.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Set upon one that is thy match, and content thy ſelf with ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſpoil of his armour from him; or elſe I ſhall ſoon make thee know that thou art not able to deal with me.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>How then ſhall I hold up my face before thy brother.]</hi> Hereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that Abner began now to think of obtaining a peace from David, and was
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:42229:178"/>
troubled to think that he ſhould have Joab his continuall adverſary, if he ſhould now ſlay his brother Aſahel.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Abner with the hinder end of his ſpear ſmote him under the fifth rib,</hi> &amp;c.] About the place where the ſhort ribs are; which is added, becauſe in that place the blow muſt needs be mortall: and it was done <hi>with the hinder end of the ſpear,</hi> that is, with the pike in the lower end of the ſpear, for their ſpears had pikes at both ends.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And the children of Benjamin gathered themſelves together after Abner,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſome of his broken troops gathering together about Abner on the top of an hill, encouraged with the advantage of the place, and night approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, began to make head againſt Joab again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Knowest thou not that it will be bitterneſſe in the latter end?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though in your heat of proſecuting the victory you have gotten, the bloud of our brethren is not minded, yet afterward it will cauſe bitter ſorrow, even theſe few of our army which are left, when they ſee their condition is deſperate, may happely ſell their lives amongſt thy followers at a deare rate; but however, the ſhedding of ſo much bloud of Iſrael, your brethren, will end at laſt in bitterneſſe, and therefore deſiſt: <hi>How long ſhall it be ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Unleſſe thou hadſt ſpoken, ſurely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.]</hi> That is, unleſſe thou hadſt by chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging the young men on our ſide, provoked the people, (and he means that chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge mentioned verſ. 14.) ſo farre we were from deſiring to ſhed the bloud of our brethren, that purpoſely to prevent it, we were minded to have retired in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the battel was fought.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Joab doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe was greatly incenſed for the death of his brother Aſahel, yet hoping that Abner began to bethink himſelf of the loſſe they had ſuſtained, and eſpecially to prevent the further ſhedding of the bloud of their brethren, he ſounded a retreat, <hi>neither fought they any more,</hi> to wit, at this time: for afterwards the warre was renewed again, as is evident in the next chapter, verſ. 1.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>BUt David waxed ſtronger and ſtronger, and the houſe of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.]</hi> Herein was Davids kingdome (as in many other things) a type of Chriſts, and that both generally in the whole Church, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the heart of every true Chriſtian: for thus ſhall it alwayes be betwix: the kingdome of Chriſt, and the kingdome of Antichriſt, between the fleſh and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the regenerate. The Church of Chriſt ſhall grow ſtronger and ſtronger, and Antichriſt ſhall conſume away, and grow weaker and weaker; though he may ſeem to gather ſtrength for a time, yet by degrees he ſhall looſe again more then for that time he had gotten; and ſo he ſhall waſte and conſume away, till at laſt his kingdome ſhall be utterly ruined; and ſo it is likewiſe with the kingdome of Chriſt erected in the hearts of all true believers, though the ſpirituall part be never ſo weak at the firſt, yet it ſhall by little and little grow in ſtrength; and the fleſh on the other ſide

                     <hi>And the third Abſalom, the ſonne of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geſhur.]</hi> There was an inrode made by David into this land of Geſhur, whileſt he lived with Achiſh, 1. Sam. 27.8. and therefore ſome think that David then took this Maacah captive, and ſo took her to wife, as is permitted by the Law, Deut. 21.13. <hi>And ſhe ſhall put the rayment of her captivity from off her, and ſhall remain in thine houſe, and bewail her father and her mother a full moneth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after that thou ſhalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and ſhe ſhall be thy wife.</hi> But Abſaloms flying to this Talmai his grandfather by the mothers ſide, chap. 13.37. may rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that he had her by way of peaceable treaty, and that was doubtleſſe unlawfull unleſſe ſhe yielded to become a proſelyte.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the ſixth Ithram, by Eglah Davids wife.]</hi> This clauſe, <hi>Davids wife,</hi> is here added, either becauſe her parentage was not known, which is expreſſed in the reſt of his wives, and therefore this title is added in ſtead of that, or to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh this Eglah from ſome other woman of the ſame name; or elſe to imply the ſame concerning the reſt before named, and that he had theſe children in Hebron by his wives, beſides thoſe which he had by his concubines, 1. Chron. 3.9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And Iſhboſheth ſaid to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my fathers concubine?]</hi> It is not expreſſed that Abner had lien with Riſpah his fathers concubine, but onely that Iſhboſheth charged him with it; and therefore we cannot ſay whether it were ſo indeed, or whether Iſhboſheth out of ſome groundleſſe jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or falſe report did onely ſuſpect it was ſo. But however, moſt probable it is that Iſhboſheths diſcontent was not onely becauſe he took it to be a diſhonour to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his ſervant ſhould lie with his concubine; but alſo eſpecially becauſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it was out of ſome cloſe and ſecret affectation of the kingdome. It ſeems that the taking of the deceaſed kings wives or concubines, was in theſe times eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dangerous for the raiſing of the ſpirits of thoſe that did it to ſeek the crown, and that therefore it was judged fit, that the ſucceeding king ſhould take all the wives and concubines of his predeceſſour the deceaſed king, into his power; whence was that which the Lord by the Prophet Nathan ſaid to David, chap. 12.8. <hi>I gave thee thy maſters houſe, and thy masters wives into thy boſome, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon conceived of Adonijahs deſiring Abiſhag for his wife, who was Davids con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, to wit, that he did it out of an ambitious affectation of the kingdome, 1. Kings 2.22. So did Iſhboſheth conceive of Abners going in to Riſpah, Sauls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine; namely, that he had therein ſome plot by degrees to thruſt him out, and to wind in himſelf to be king in his room, and therefore charged him ſo ſharply with it.</p>

                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:42229:179"/>Verſ. 8. <hi>Am I a dogs head, which against Judah do ſhew kindneſſe this day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of Saul,</hi> &amp;c.] By this anſwer of Abners to Iſhboſheth, we cannot conclude neither whether he were guilty or no, of that which Iſhboſheth had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with; for the meaning of theſe words may be either that he thought himſelf greatly wronged, that Iſhboſheth ſhould ſuſpect him for, or accuſe him of, ſuch a foul fact as this, of committing whoredome with his fathers concubine, or elſe that he took it in high diſdain that Iſhboſheth ſhould eſteem ſo meanly and baſely of him, as to make ſuch a matter of it, and to take it to be ſo great a diſparagement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour both to him and to his father, that he ſhould go in to one of his fathers concubines: But yet I conceive it more probable, that the laſt of theſe was Abners meaning; Firſt, becauſe that phraſe, <hi>Am I a dogs head?</hi> doth rather import the worthleſneſſe of his perſon, then his luſtfulneſſe in that fact he was charged with, as ſome would have it; for ſo we ſee the like phraſe is uſed elſewhere, as 1. Sam. 24.14. <hi>After whom doſt thou purſue?</hi> ſaith David to Saul, <hi>after a dead dog, after a flea? &amp;c.</hi> 2. Sam. 9.8. <hi>What is thy ſervant that thou ſhouldest look upon ſuch a dead dog, as I am,</hi> ſaith Mephiboſheth to David: and ſecondly, becauſe that which Abner here alledgeth concerning his ſiding with him againſt the houſe of Judah, muſt needs be alledged, to ſhew how little cauſe he had ſo to vilifie him, by whoſe means he was made king, and had been hitherto ſupported in his kingdome, and in whoſe power it was if he pleaſed, to deliver him up into the hands of David. So that it ſeems by this anſwer of Abners, that he did purpoſely wave the making any reply to the fact he was charged with, either by denying or juſtifying of it, and onely quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled that Iſhboſheth ſhould think ſo meanly of him, as to take it for ſuch a diſgrace to his family (whether it were true or falſe) that he ſhould lie with one of his fathers concubines. <hi>Am I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a dogs head, that thou chargeſt me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And he could not anſwer Abner a word again, becauſe he feared him.]</hi> From this which is here ſaid of Iſhboſheth, ſome Expoſitours conclude, that he was a poore and low-ſpirited man, and the rather, becauſe they obſerve too, that he alone of all the ſonnes of Saul went not forth to warre againſt the Philiſtines, when Saul and his ſonnes were ſlain. But indeed, conſidering what exceeding power theſe men had amongſt the people, that commanded in chief over the Militia, it is no wonder that he ſhould be ſo daunted, when Abner in a rage anſwered him ſo inſolently, and threatned him openly with revolting to David. Nor could it be concluded from hence alone, that he was a man of no great metall and courage: for even David himſelf upon the ſame ground, was overmuch awed with Joabs power, and durſt not do to him what otherwiſe he would have done, verſ. 39. <hi>I am this day weak though anointed king, and theſe men the ſonnes of Zeruiah be too hard for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And Abner ſent meſſengers to David on his behalf? ſaying, Whoſe is the land,</hi> &amp;c.] This clauſe in Abners meſſage to David, <hi>Whoſe is the land?</hi> might be meant two ſeverall wayes, to wit, either to intimate, that he had the land of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in his power, and could as he pleaſed either ſettle it upon the houſe of Saul or remove it to David; or elſe to imply that he did now acknowledge that the land did indeed belong to David, whom God by Samuel had anointed to be king over Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and that therefore he was now willing to transferre the kingdome to him; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42229:179"/>
he deſired that he would firſt aſſure him, that he would pardon all that was paſt, and upon good conditions make a league with him. And thus he pretended to come in to David, merely becauſe the land was his, and the kingdome his by Gods appointment, when indeed he did it merely to be revenged on Iſhboſheth, and to procure peace, and perhaps advancement too for himſelf: even as many men in theſe dayes of the Goſpel, come unto Chriſt, pretending they do it for the truths ſake, when indeed they ſeek themſelves onely in ſome carnall reſpects, as Abner did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſee my face, except thou bring Michal Sauls daughter when thou comeſt to ſee my face.]</hi> Though ſhe had lived many years with another husband, yet Davids earneſtneſſe to have her reſtored to him, and that with a purpoſe to have her live with him again as his wife, as ſhe did, needs not ſeem ſtrange to us, if we conſider, firſt, that ſhe was his firſt wife, and had been faithfull to him in preſerving his life, 1. Sam. 19.11, 12. and had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by her father to marry this man when David was fled, 1. Sam. 25.44. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that David could no way better ſhew his love to her, then by reſcuing her from the ſinne and infamy of living in adultery with another man: thirdly, that it might be in policy a matter of great importance to ſettle peace in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to eſtabliſh the kingdome to David, that this his wife ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to him again, becauſe ſhe was Sauls daughter: and fourthly, that by this means he ſhould make triall of the fidelity of Abner.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And David ſent meſſengers to Iſhboſheth Sauls ſonne, ſaying, deliver me my wife Michal,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus it ſeems David and Abner had contrived the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, that David ſhould ſend to Iſhboſheth for his wife, and that then Abner ſhould ſecond the motion and procure it to be done: for that Abner had a hand in cauſing Iſhboſheth to reſtore David his wife, is evident, verſ. 16. becauſe Abner went along with her to Bahurim. Now in the challenge that he makes of his wife, <hi>Deliver me my wife Michal which I eſpouſed to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philiſtines,</hi> he mentions onely a hundred foreskins; becauſe ſo many onely Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was by covenant bound to bring, though he brought two hundred, 1. Sam. 18.25, 27.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim.]</hi> A town in the tribe of Benjamin, chap. 19.16.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Abner had communication with the elders of Iſrael, ſaying, Ye ſought for David in times paſt to be king over you.]</hi> Hereby it appears, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Iſraelites would have followed David before this, but that they durſt not for fear of Abner: For the leaſt we can conclude from hence is, that before Iſhbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth was made king by Abner, the Iſraelites were divided, ſome ſtanding for Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, others for Iſhboſheth Sauls ſonne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And Abner went alſo to ſpeak in the ears of David in Hebron all that ſeemed good to Iſrael, and that ſeemed good to the whole houſe of Benjamin.]</hi> That is, to the greateſt part of them, 1. Chron. 12.29. Abner having treated with the elders of Iſrael about their accepting of David to be their king, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with thoſe of Benjamin, becauſe they were like to be hardlieſt wonne in regard of their eſpeciall relation to the houſe of Saul who was of their tribe; he went to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42229:180"/>
David (perhaps under pretence of carrying his wife Michal to him, to which Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth had conſented) and ſo then acquainted him how tractable he had found the Iſraelites, and how willing to ſubmit to his government: yea even the men of Benjamin amongſt the reſt, of whom David had moſt cauſe to fear that he ſhould have found them refractory.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Thou knoweſt Abner the ſonne of Ner, that he came to deceive thee,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus though Joab doubtleſſe was chiefly enraged, becauſe he feared Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would inſinuate himſelf into David, and prove a corrivall to him in his honours and preferments; and withall, becauſe his heart was full of revengefull thoughts againſt him for the death of his brother Aſahel, yet he alledged none of this to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, but onely that he was ſolicitous for him, as being confident that Abner came onely as a ſpie, and ſought to get ſome advantage againſt David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And when Joab was come out from David, he ſent meſſengers after Abner,</hi> &amp;c.] Having ſpoken his mind to David, it may ſeem that he flung away in an anger, not vouchſafing to hear what David would anſwer, and ſo being come out, <hi>he ſent meſſengers after Abner</hi> to bring him back, and happely he ſent in the name of the king (which might be one cauſe why David was ſo carefull afterward to clear himſelf of it,) but doubtleſſe he pretended that he had ſome buſineſſe of importance to impart to him: or elſe, it is not like that Abner would have come back again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Joab took him aſide in the gate to ſpeak with him quietly, and ſmote him there under the fifth rib,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus Joab and Abiſhai had plotted the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before hand, whence is that verſ. 30. <hi>So Joab and Abiſhai ſlew Abner becauſe he had ſlain their brother Aſahel at Gibeon in the battell,</hi> &amp;c. by this means (though the fact in Joab was foul and wicked) God puniſhed Abner for his riſing up againſt David, and making ſo light account of ſhedding ſo much bloud, chap. 2.14. <hi>And Abner ſaid to Joab let the young men now ariſe and play before us:</hi> and withall, God removed him out of the way, that David might come to have all Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſubmit themſelves to him without the help of Abners treachery; for that phraſe of ſmiting under the fifth rib, ſee the note, chap. 2.23.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>I and my kingdome are guiltleſſe before the Lord for ever from the bloud of Abner,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe the Lord many times plagues the whole land for the magiſtrates ſhedding innocent bloud, therefore David in this proteſtation that he makes of his innocencie, mentions the kingdome together with himſelf, <hi>I and my kingdome are guiltleſſe.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>Let there not fail from the houſe of Joab one that hath an iſſue,</hi> &amp;c.] David knew well that it was much to be ſuſpected, that the people would think that Abner was ſlain by his command, or at leaſt not without his conſent, and how like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this was to alienate the hearts of the people from him; In a buſineſſe therefore that ſo nearly concerned him, no marvell though in the bitterneſſe of his ſpirit he poured forth theſe heavy imprecations againſt Joab and all his poſterity, <hi>Let there not fail from the houſe of Joab one that hath an iſſue,</hi> that is, the running of the reins, (ſee the note, Lev. 15.21.) <hi>or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a ſtaff</hi> through lameneſſe or weakneſſe; and why he did not proceed further to do juſtice upon Joab, which would have been of all, the beſt way to clear his own innocencie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42229:180"/>
ſheweth, verſ. 39. <hi>I am this day weak though anointed king, and theſe men the ſonnes of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the Lord ſhall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>So Joab and Abiſhai his brother ſlew Abner, becauſe he had ſlain their brother Aſahel at Gibeon in the battell.]</hi> Theſe words, <hi>in the battell,</hi> are added as an aggravatian of Joabs ſinne: For Abner ſlew Aſahel in open battell, and was forced thereto by Aſahels purſuite of him; but Joab ſlew Abner treacherouſly, when he pretended to ſpeak peaceably with him; why Abiſhai is here joyned with Joab, ſee the note above, verſe 27.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And David ſaid to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rent your clothes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he enjoyned them to bury Abner with a ſolemn funerall, thereby teſtifying his ſorrow for his death, and clearing himſelf before all the people from having any hand in it. Neither was it unfit that Joab amongſt others ſhould be enjoyned to be a publick mourner at his exequies: for firſt he had more cauſe to mourn then any man, becauſe of his ſinne: David therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him thereunto did that which was fit; if Joab therein diſſembled, it was his own fault. Secondly, it might be impoſed as a kind of puniſhment that he ſhould publickly by being one of the mourners bear witneſſe of Abners worth, whom in his rage he had ſlain. Concerning the cuſtome of renting their clothes, ſee the note, Gen. 37.29.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And the king lamented over Abner, and ſaid, died Abner as a fool di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?]</hi> That is, he died not as a fool dieth; his hands were not bound, &amp;c. the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that he died not as a weak and cowardly man, that is, taken in warre and led captive, his hands being bound, or as a malefactor that is caſt into priſon and bound in fetters, (no ſaith he, he that ſlew him, had he done it in open fight, he ſhould have found that his hands were not bound, &amp;c.) but he was ſlain, as the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anteſt man in the world might have been ſlain, to wit, treacherouſly; by one that pretended peace and ſmote him unawares. Perhaps this was the elegie which David compoſed to be ſung at Abners funerall.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And when all the people came to cauſe David to eat meat,</hi> &amp;c.] By theſe words is intimated, that there was a ſolemn feaſt at the funerall of Abner, where <hi>all the people,</hi> that is, the gueſts invited, or ſome in the name of all, ſeeing or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the king refuſed to eat, laboured to perſwade him to eat, till with ſuch ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe he proteſted to the contrary: and indeed that it was a cuſtome amongſt Gods people in the time of the law to have feaſts at their funeralls, either thereby to allay their grief, or to teſtifie their hope concerning the good eſtate of their deceaſed friends, may be gathered from other places. For thence are thoſe expreſſions, Jer. 16.7, 8. <hi>Neither ſhall men tear themſelves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead: neither ſhall men give them the cup of conſolation to drink for their father, or for their mother. Thou ſhalt not alſo go into the houſe of feaſting: to ſit with them to eat and to drink.</hi> and Ezek. 24.17. <hi>Forbear to cry, and make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy ſhoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.</hi> As for Davids oath when he replyed that he would not eat, <hi>So do God to me and more alſo,</hi> ſee the note, Ruth 1.17.</p>

                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:42229:181"/>Verſ. 36. <hi>As whatſoever the king did, pleaſed all the people.]</hi> This is referred by ſome Expoſitours to this particular of Davids ordering the funerall of Abner, that whatſoever the king did herein, pleaſed the people; but yet it may alſo be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood more generally, to wit, that the king was ſo highly eſteemed and beloved of the people, that they were ſtill inclinable to approve of any thing that he did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And I am this day weak, though anointed king, and theſe men the ſonnes of Zeruiah be too hard for me,</hi> &amp;c.] By alledging the power of Joab and Abiſhai, and the unſettledneſſe of his eſtate in the kingdome for the preſent, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to excuſe himſelf for not puniſhing Joab for this fact of his according to the law. Indeed by many things related both of Joab and Abner it appears, that theſe that were generals over the men of warre were very potent. But why then did not David execute juſtice upon Joab afterward, when he was eſtabliſhed in his throne? Doubtleſſe it was an infirmitie in David, and before his death it ſeems he repented of his errour, which that charge of his to Solomon may probably imply, 1. Kings 2.5, 6. <hi>Moreover thou knoweſt alſo, what Joab the ſonne of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hoſt of Iſrael, unto Abner the ſonne of Ner, and unto Amaſa the ſonne of Jether, whom he ſlew and ſhed the bloud of warre in peace, and put the bloud of warre upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his ſhoes that were on his feet. Do therefore according to thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd when Sauls ſonne heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he was ſo diſmayed and diſcouraged, Abner being ſlain on whom he wholly relyed, that there was no power in him to do any thing for himſelf: the like phraſe we have, Ezra 4.4. <hi>And the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building;</hi> and Neh. 6.9. <hi>They all made us afraid, ſaying, Their hands ſhall be weakened from the work that it be not done. Now therefore O God, ſtrengthen my hands.</hi> Yea, and thus it was too with all the tribes of Iſrael, as it follows in the next words, <hi>and all Iſrael were troubled,</hi> to wit, becauſe they had oppoſed David, and now their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall on whoſe counſell and power they had hitherto ſtayed themſelves, was taken away; yea, and that when he went about to yield himſelf to David, and further his title to the crown. So that ſhould they go forward in that reſolution of revolting from Iſhboſheth to David, they ſuſpected they ſhould find no more favour then Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had found.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>For Beeroth alſo was reckoned to Benjamin,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added, to ſhew why Rimmon the father of the two forenamed captains, is called a Beerothite, to wit, becauſe he belonged to Beeroth a city in Benjamin, Joſh. 18.25. For though they dwelt not indeed at preſent in Beeroth, but ſojourned in Gittam another town in Benjamin, Neh. 11.33. yet that was becauſe the Beerothites fled to Gittam, and were ſojourners there, (to wit, when Saul and his ſonnes were ſlain) leaving Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth to the Philiſtines, who came and dwelt in it, 1. Sam. 31.7. and ſo ſtill they were called Beerothites after the place of their former habitation, and lived but as ſojourners in Gittam amongſt their brethren the children of Benjamin.</p>

Some think that in deteſtation of the heathen idols the Hebrews were wont many times to leave out the word Baal, and to put in the room of it this word <hi>boſheth,</hi> or <hi>beſheth</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>a ſhamefull</hi> or <hi>infamous thing,</hi> Hoſ. 9.10. <hi>They went to Baal-peor and ſeparated themſelves unto that ſhame.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And they came thither into the midst of the houſe, as though they would have fetched wheat,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, either that they came in the diſguiſe and habite of countreymen or merchants that came to buy wheat, or of porters that came to fetch away wheat that was bought, or elſe rather, that being known Captains of Iſhboſheths bands, under a colour that they came to fetch corn for the ſouldiers or for themſelves, (for the ſouldiers in thoſe times had uſually their pay in corn) they had free acceſſe into the houſe, and ſo went in where he lay, and ſlew him, and that by ſmiting him <hi>under the fifth rib;</hi> of which, ſee the note, chap. 2.23. and this doubtleſſe they did, hoping that David would reward them for it: for though David ſeemed greatly to take to heart the death of Abner, and to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with Joab for it, yet becauſe he did not puniſh him, theſe captains per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps concluded, that David was well enough pleaſed with it, though he would not be known of it, and ſo he would be with them too, if they ſhould kill Iſhboſheth; and hereby it is likely they encouraged themſelves in this treacherous villany againſt their Lord and Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>How much more when wicked men have ſlain a righteous perſon.]</hi> That is, in reſpect of them which conſpired againſt him; he had deſerved well of them, and for them therefore thus treacherouſly to ſlay him, <hi>in his own houſe upon his bed,</hi> when he thought of no danger, was a villany that did farre more juſtly deſerve death: and the rather too, becauſe they durſt do this, notwithſtanding David had ſo ſeverely puniſhed him that pretended he had ſlain Saul.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And they ſlew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron.]</hi> To wit, that all men might ſee how much David

abhorred this fact of theirs, and how farre he was from knowing any thing of it, or giving the leaſt encouragement to them that did it.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen came all the tribes of Iſrael to David unto Hebron,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, many of all the tribes of Iſrael in the name of the reſt; not onely the elders and heads of each tribe as is expreſſed, verſ. 3. <hi>So all the elders of Iſrael came to the king to Hebron,</hi> but multitudes alſo of the people that bare arms, as is more largely expreſſed, 1. Chron. 12.23. where it is particularly expreſſed, how many thouſands of each tribe there came, as likewiſe how <hi>they were there with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid three dayes eating and drinking and making merry together,</hi> verſ. 39.40. <hi>For</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>their brethren had prepared for them, and there was joy in Iſrael;</hi> And indeed though the greateſt part of theſe tribes had for ſeven years ſtood out againſt David for Iſhboſheth and the houſe of Saul; yet becauſe now at laſt they were not ſubdued by the ſword and forced to ſubmit, but came in freely of their own accord, God enclining their hearts thereto, even this ſubmiſſion of theirs did alſo ſhadow forth the willing ſubmiſſion of believers to Chriſts ſceptre and government: as is noted before concerning the men of Judahs taking David to be their king, chap. 2.4. as likewiſe Davids free accepting of theſe, did ſhadow forth Chriſts gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious acceptance of thoſe that do at length come in, and ſubmit to him, and that he never will caſt off any for their former obſtinacy and rejecting of grace.</p>

One from among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet king over thee: thou mayeſt not ſet a king over thee which is not thy brother:</hi> and ſeeing the hand of God was ſo evidently with him, why therefore ſhould they oppoſe him? and indeed this alſo brings in all believers to ſtoop willingly (as was propheſied, Pſalme 110.3.) to the ſceptre of Chriſt, Epheſ. 5.29, 30. <hi>For no man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth it and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth it, even as the Lord the Church. For we are members of his body, of his fleſh and his bones:</hi> and Heb. 2.14, 16, 17. <hi>Foraſmuch therefore, as the children are partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.

by the Iſraelites, whereby they were now moved to come in and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Davids government: The firſt is, that they conſidered how well David had deſerved at their hands, and that indeed during Sauls reigne, he had been their chiefeſt ſupport and defence under God, againſt their enemies: and the other is, that God had by Samuel appointed him to rule over them, and they were bound by the law of God to take a king of his chooſing, Deut. 17.15, <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him king over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe, &amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>And they anointed David king over Iſrael.]</hi> This was the third time that David was anointed king and ſo was Chriſt three times by an audible voice from heaven, declared to be the Sonne of God, and the promiſed Meſſiah: Firſt, at his baptiſme, Matth. 3.16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. <hi>And Jeſus when he was baptized, went ſtraightway out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; And lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo, a voice from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Sonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Secondly, at his transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Matth 17.5. <hi>While he yet ſpake, behold a bright cloud overſhadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud which ſaid, This is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed: Heare ye him.</hi> And thirdly, a little before his death, whileſt he was teaching the people; John 12.28. when Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Father, glorifie thy name, then came there a voice from heaven, ſaying, I have glorified it, and will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie it again.</hi>

But the children of Benjamin could not drive out the Jebuſites out of their portion, Judg. 1.21. no not when they had the help of their

brethren, the men of Judah, as may be gathered by that whith is written, Joſh. 15.63. <hi>As for the Jebuſites, the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebuſites dwell with the children of Judah at Jeruſalem unto this day:</hi> And therefore we reade, that afterward it was a city of ſtrangers, when the Levite and his concubine went that way, Judg. 19.10, 11, 12. yea, ſo it continued till this time, when David intending (not without the inſtinct of the ſpirit of God) to make Jeruſalem the chief ſeat of his kingdome, and having now the advantage of a mighty aſſembly of the men of warre of Iſrael that were come up armed to Hebron to make him king, took this opportunity, and led them forth againſt Jeruſalem, reſolving that the wreſting this out of the Jebuſites hands, ſhould be his firſt enterpriſe.</p>

                     <hi>Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou ſhalt not come in hither,</hi> &amp;c.] There are many ſeverall expoſitions of this paſſage, concerning the Jebuſites ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at David when he came to beſiege them. But two expoſitions there are which are both very probable: The firſt, which indeed moſt Expoſitours follow, is this, That being over-confident in the ſtrength of the place, they in a flouting manner anſwered David, when he required them to yield up the fort, that except he could take from them the blind and the lame amongſt the inhabitants, he ſhould not come in thither; implying, that though they ſhould man their walls onely with the blind and the lame of the people, even they ſhould be able to defend that place againſt him and all the forces he could make. And indeed, it ſeems to have been a place of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great ſtrength, becauſe they had held it ever ſince Joſhua entred the land; that is, almoſt foure hundred years, and yet it was even in the heart of their countrey. The ſecond Expoſition is, That they ſpake this of their gods, in whom they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit the leſſe confident, becauſe the Iſraelites deſpiſed them; <hi>except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou ſhalt not come in hither,</hi> that is, even thoſe gods of ours, which you in contempt call blind and lame gods, ſhall eaſily defend us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thy forces, and will in that be found to be neither lame nor blind. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this expoſition ſeems beſt to agree with the following paſſages in the 8. verſe: <hi>And David ſaid on that day, Whoſoever getteth up to the gutter, and ſmiteth the Jebuſites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of Davids ſoul, he ſhall be chief captain, Wherefore they ſay, The lame and the blind ſhall not enter into the houſe.</hi> Nor need it ſeem ſtrange, that they call their own gods blind and lame: for this they might do purpoſely, to let the Iſraelites ſee how little they were diſcouraged by theſe reproches which the Iſraelites caſt upon their idol-gods, from putting their truſt in them, as being moſt confident of their aid and aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Nevertheleſſe, David took the ſtrong hold of Sion, the ſame is the city of David.]</hi> For David having proclaimed, that whoſoever ſhould firſt ſcale the walls, and ſo get up to the gutter, as it is expreſſed in the next verſe, and enter the fort, <hi>he ſhould be chief captain,</hi> that is, the Generall of his forces, Joab the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happely that he might recover Davids favour, whom he had highly offended by killing Abner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did hereupon firſt ſcale the walls, and ſo was made the Lord General of the kings forces, as it is more fully expreſſed, 1. Chron. 11.6. and this was that ſtrong hold of Sion, which becauſe it was taken by him, was afterward called <hi>the city of David.</hi>

                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:42229:183"/>Verſ. 8. <hi>Whoſoever getteth up to the gutter, and ſmiteth the Jebuſites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of Davids ſoul,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the blind and the lame Jebuſites, wherewith they had, or pretended they could manne their walls, and that it ſhould be ſufficient for the defence of the place, which are here ſaid to <hi>be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Davids ſoul,</hi> becauſe of that bitter taunt wherewith he had been flouted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; and herein David gives his ſouldiers to underſtand, that if they took the fort, his mind was all ſhould be put to the ſword, not ſo much as the blind and the lame ſhould be ſpared, and that becauſe he had been upbraided with them; but according to the ſecond Expoſition of that ſpeech of the Jebuſites, that it is meant of their blind and lame gods (which may ſeem the more probable, becauſe here the Jebuſites, and the blind and lame, are diſtinguiſhed from each other, <hi>who ſo ſmiteth the Jebuſites, and the blind and the lame;</hi> the meaning of this clauſe is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to wit, that theſe their idol-gods were abhorred of David, and that he would utterly deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore they ſaid, the blind and the lame ſhall not come into the houſe.]</hi> That is, it grew to be a Proverb, to wit, <hi>the blind and the lame ſhall not come into the houſe.</hi> They that underſtand that ſpeech of the Jebuſites, verſ. 6 <hi>Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou ſhalt not come in hither,</hi> of the blind and lame amongſt the people, find it ſomewhat difficult to give the ſence of this Proverb. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that againſt thoſe that were confident of keeping any fort, which they could not keep, or (generally) that bragged of any thing which they could not effect, this uſed to be objected as a Proverb, <hi>the blind and the lame ſhall not come into the houſe,</hi> that is, take heed your confidence prove not like that of the Jebuſites, or if you do it, it muſt not be by the blind and the lame, as the Jebuſites thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their walls; or take heed that be not done to you, which you threaten againſt others, as David caſt out the blind and lame, which ſhould have kept out him: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think that the people did thus inſult over the Jebuſites, your blind and lame, that ſhould have kept out us, are never likely to enter again into this fort; or that David did indeed make this order, as a perpetuall monument of this victory, that neither blind nor lame ſhould enter his pallace, called the citie of David (but did Mephiboſheth think we, never enter it?) But now if we underſtand that ſpeech of the Jebuſites, verſ. 6. of their idol-gods, then the meaning of this Proverb is plain, to wit, that no blind nor lame gods ſhould be tolerated in the Temple or in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or any where amongſt them that were the people of the everliving God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And David built round about, from Millo and inward.]</hi> This Millo was the town-houſe in the citie of David, where the people had their ſolemn aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, or rather ſome tower or fortreſſe and place of munition belonging to the citie; for 2. Chron. 3.5. it is ſaid of Hezekiah, that he <hi>repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts, and ſhields in abundance,</hi> and we ſee there was the like place in She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem or near unto it, Judg. 9.6. <hi>And all the men of Shechem gathered together and all the houſe of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king.</hi> Now from thence inward onely David is ſaid to have built, becauſe the reſt of the citie without, Joab repaired, 1. Chron. 11.8. <hi>And he built the citie round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the reſt of the citie.</hi>

hand, like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim,</hi> and ſo much is expreſſed in the following words of David, <hi>the Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters,</hi> which hath reference either to the diſperſion of the enemie, who were ſcattered; as water in an earthen veſſell, will runne about when the veſſell is broken: or to Gods power in driving away the enemie, as when waters break through the banks, and ſweep away all before them, and thence this place was called <hi>Baal-perazim,</hi> or <hi>the plain of breaches:</hi> and to this the Prophet doth allude, Iſa. 28.21. <hi>For the Lord ſhall riſe up as in mount Perazim, he ſhall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his ſtrange work, and bring to paſſe his act, his ſtrange act.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And there they left their images, and David and his men burnt them.]</hi> That is, the ſouldiers burnt them at Davids command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo it is expreſſed, 1. Chron. 14.12. <hi>And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burnt with fire;</hi> and this was according to the Law, Deut. 7.5. <hi>Thus ſhall you deal with them, Ye ſhall deſtroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.</hi> Now the leaving of their gods there, is a ſigne of the terrour wherewith they were ſtricken.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up; but fetch a compaſſe behind them, and come upon them over againſt the mulberry trees.]</hi> That is, thou ſhalt not go up directly againſt them, but fetching a compaſſe about, ſhalt ſet upon them over againſt the mulberry trees, to wit, that ſetting ſuddenly upon them, where they looked not for him, the aſſault might ſtrike them with the greater terrour.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And let it be when thou hearest the ſound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou ſhalt beſtirre thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] When David heard <hi>the ſound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees,</hi> not a noiſe of the ſhaking of the tops of the trees, with a wind, but a ſound, as if ſome body were going upon the tops of the trees; then he was to break forth ſuddenly upon the Philiſtines, whether this <hi>ſound of going</hi> were as if an army of men, horſemen and chariots had been marching over the tops of the trees, as ſome conceive, we cannot ſay; but doubtleſſe it was appointed as a ſigne of Gods going forth with his holy angels, to deſtroy the Philiſtines before them, wherewith David being encouraged, was preſently to break forth and ſet upon them; and therefore it was upon the tops of the trees, not on the ground, to ſignifie forces that were ſent from on high from heaven, and ſuch as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the ground to ſupport them, but could march through the aire, to come in, to the help of his people.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>AGain David gathered together all the choſen men of Iſrael, thirty thouſand.]</hi> The ark, the eſpeciall ſigne of Gods preſence amongſt his people, and from whence he had promiſed to anſwer them concerning all things, he would give them in charge, had been in the private houſe of Abinadab in Kirjath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jearim about ſeven and fourtie years, ever ſince the Philiſtines ſent it back to the land of Judah, 1. Sam. 7.1. now becauſe being there in a private houſe the people began by degrees to neglect it, as if they had forgot what a treaſure it was, ſo ſoon as David was eſtabliſhed in the kingdome and had driven the Jebuſites out of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42229:188"/>
he thought preſently of fetching up the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Jeruſalem; firſt, as judging it moſt for the honour of God and of his ark, that it ſhould not lie hid in a private family, but be ſettled in the chief citie of the kingdome in a place purpoſely appointed for it: and ſecondly, that being in the heart of the kingdome, and in Jeruſalem the royall citie, the people might the more conveniently reſort unto it, to conſult with God and to perform the duties of his worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In the 1. Chron. 13.1, 2, &amp;c. it is ſaid, that firſt David called together all the captains, and elders, and heads of the people, and imparted to them what he thought, and then conſulted with them, whether it would not be beſt to gather together all the choſen men of Iſrael that they might in a ſolemn manner fetch up the ark of God unto Jeruſalem; and that when they had approved of this his purpoſe, then he gathered together this great aſſembly of the people, even thirty thouſand as is here related; and indeed the reaſon why the relation of the fetching up the ark is in that firſt book of Chronicles ſet before the relation of the two victories which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over the Philiſtines, whereas here the ſtory of thoſe two victories is ſet down firſt in the latter end of the former chapter, may well be this, becauſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with the captains and elders, was before the invaſion of the Philiſtines, but the aſſembling of the people to fetch up the ark was after it, as here it is ſet down.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And David aroſe, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, being come with all thoſe choſen men of Iſrael, whom he had gathered together to Baale of Judah, (that is, to Kirjath-jearim, 1. Chron. 13.6. which was alſo called Kirjath-baal, Joſh. 15.9. and Baalah or Baaleh of Judah, where the ark had been ſo long a time ſaving onely when it was upon extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſions brought into the camp, as there, 1. Sam. 14.18.) David aroſe and went thence to carry the ark unto Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And they ſet the Ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the houſe of Abinadab that was in Gibeah.]</hi> That is, a hill or high place ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Kirjath-jearim, of which ſee the note, 1. Sam. 7.1. doubtleſſe becauſe it was a long way to carry the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Jeruſalem, therefore they put it in a cart, encouraged thereto by the example of the Philiſtines, and thence it was that they put it into <hi>a new cart</hi> as they alſo did, 1. Sam. 6.7, 8. <hi>Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, and take the ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart,</hi> &amp;c. But herein they manifeſtly tranſgreſſed the law of God, which expreſſely appointed that the Levites ſhould carry it upon their ſhoulders, Num. 4.15. and 7.9. and ſo this was the firſt occaſion of Gods diſpleaſure, and of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall accident that followed in the death of Uzzah, verſ. 6. for ſo much David him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledged, when he came up the ſecond time with the Iſraelites to fetch away the ark, 1. Chron. 15.12, 13. <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves,</hi> ſaith he to the Levites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>both ye and your brethren that you may bring up the ark of the Lord God of Iſrael, unto the place that I have prepared for it; for becauſe ye did it not at firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord our God made a breach upon us, for that we ſought him not after the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> It is indeed very ſtrange that when David had called together thirty thouſand men of the chief of Iſrael, both prieſts and others, there ſhould not be one amongſt them all that ſhould ſtumble at this, but that they ſhould all runne on ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42229:188"/>
in ſo groſſe an errour. But we muſt conſider that they had been long ſtrangers to the ark, and never queſtioned but that they might ſafely do, what the Philiſtines had done before them without any danger; and then beſides, God would let us ſee how eaſily multitudes of Gods people may erre, if they do not the more heedfully examine all by the rules of the word.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And Ahio went before the Ark.]</hi> To wit, to look to the oxen, as Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah went behind to take care of the cart and the ark that was in it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And when they came to Nachons threſhing floor,</hi> &amp;c.] This Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon is alſo called Chidon, 1. Chron. 13.9. and the laſt clauſe of this verſe which is here tranſlated, <hi>for the oxen ſhook it,</hi> is there tranſlated <hi>for the oxen ſtumbled,</hi> and it may well be that the oxens ſtumbling ſhook the ark, and ſo thereupon Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah laid hold on the ark to ſtay it, for fear it ſhould have fallen. Where this threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing floor of Nachon or Chidon was, it is not expreſſed, but moſt probable it is, that they had not gone farre from the houſe of Abinadab in Kirjath-jearim ere the Lord by this ſad diſaſter teſtified his diſpleaſure againſt them for carrying the ark in a cart.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And God ſmote him there for his errour,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put the ark into a cart which ſhould have been carried on the Levites ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he now alſo laid hold on the ark, which no man might touch but the prieſts onely, Num. 4.15. <hi>The ſonnes of Kohath ſhall come to bear it: but they ſhall not touch any holy thing leſt they die.</hi> Indeed the ark was to be covered by the law, but perhaps in this as in other things, they had neglected the direction of the law; or elſe, being covered onely with a looſe covering, that might flie up with the tottering of the cart, Uzzah might touch the bare ark with his hand; and for this God preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtruck him dead in the place. A moſt remarkable example of Gods ſeverity againſt thoſe that will not keep cloſe to the direction of his word in all things that concern his worſhip, upon what pretence ſoever they do it. Though Abinadab the father of this Uzzah had entertained the ark in his houſe above fourty years together, and took it in at a time when others were afraid to receive it through the terrour of the judgement which fell upon the men of Bethſhemeſh, 1. Sam. 6.19, 20. Yet was his ſonne now ſtruck ſuddenly dead, becauſe he reached forth his hand and touched the ark; and yet he did it too with a good intention to ſtay the ark from falling; and ſuddenly, not thinking of the unlawfulneſſe of this act, as is intimated in theſe words, <hi>God ſmote him there for his errour,</hi> or <hi>raſhneſſe,</hi> as it is in the margin of our bibles.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And David was diſpleaſed, becauſe the Lord had made a breach upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah.]</hi> That is, he was grieved, troubled, and diſquieted becauſe of this heavy judgement wherewith the Lord had broken forth upon Uzzah. Some will have this underſtood, that David was merely diſpleaſed with themſelves for their heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, as thinking it too harſh to ſay of David that he was diſpleaſed with God; but doubtleſſe it was partly the very judgement it ſelf that befell Uzzah that he was troubled at; he could not well keep his heart from murmuring and riſing againſt this ſeveritie of God, in ſtriking Uzzah dead in the place for ſo ſmall a matter, he was diſcontented, that when they had undertaken ſuch a work of piety, on a ſudden all the joy of the people ſhould be daſhed and damped with ſuch a ſad diſaſter; and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42229:189"/>
ſo, partly becauſe he did not ſo quietly ſtoop at firſt under Gods hand as he ought to have done, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>David was diſpleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>How ſhall the ark of the Lord come to me?]</hi> That is, I ſhall not do it without danger, yea it ſeems the Lord is not pleaſed that the ark ſhould be carried to Jeruſalem; and therefore it will be ſafer to deſiſt from my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>But David carried it aſide to the houſe of Obed-edom the Gittite.]</hi> Who it ſeems gladly entertained it. Though no doubt he knew well enough what a ſlaughter was made amongſt the men of Bethſhemeſh, at the firſt coming of the ark thither; and though now alſo perhaps he ſaw when Uzzah was ſtricken dead by the hand of God for touching the ark, and that David himſelf trembled and was afraid to to carry home the ark to his houſe, yet conſidering that there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in harbouring the ark if they carried themſelves with that reſpect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence therein that God required, he gladly received the ark into his houſe. That this Obed-edom was a Levite is evident, 1. Chron. 15.17, 18. and therefore it ſeems he is here called Obed-edom the Gittite, becauſe he was of Gathrimmon a citie which was given in common by the tribes of Dan and Manaſſeh to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites of the family of Kohath, as we may ſee, Joſh. 21.24, 25.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And it was told king David, ſaying The Lord hath bleſſed the houſe of Obed-edom,</hi> &amp;c.] It is not expreſſed what it was wherein they perceived that God had bleſſed Obed-edom and all his family; but doubtleſſe it was ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and wonderfull bleſſing that God poured forth upon him and his, in the encreaſe of his cattell and the ſucceſſe of all his affairs, &amp;c. becauſe it was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcovered and notice taken of it by thoſe that dwelt about him in ſo ſhort a time; for the ark was in his houſe but three moneths in all, as is noted in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe. Indeed in the 1. Chron. 26.5. it is ſaid that the numerouſneſſe of his children was, becauſe <hi>the Lord bleſſed him;</hi> but this could not be the bleſſing here ſpoken of, that in the ſpace of three moneths was ſo clearly diſcerned by thoſe that lived about him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So David went and brought up the Ark of God,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, perceiving by Gods bounty to Obed-edom, that the ark might be entertained without danger, he at length found out where their former errour had been, and ſo reſolving to amend that, he undertook again to fetch the ark to Jeruſalem; and having again aſſembled the people, and given the Prieſts and Levites their charge, to wit, to carry the ark on their ſhoulders, he fetched it with great ſolemnity from the houſe of Obed-edom; as is largely related in the 15. and 16. chapters of the firſt book of Chronicles.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>When they that bare the ark of God had gone ſix paces, he ſacrificed oxen and fatlings.]</hi> And this he did, Firſt, by way of teſtifying their thankfulneſſe to God, for their ſucceſſefull entrance upon this great work; ſo ſoon as David percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they had begun this work, and that as yet there was no ſigne of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt them, as there had been formerly in the ſmiting of Uzzah, it greatly cheared his heart, and thereupon he judged it fit to ſtay a while there, and offer God ſome ſacrifices by way of thanksgiving, to wit, upon ſome altar for that purpoſe erected. He knew well that it was of Gods mercy that they had found out their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer errour, in carrying the ark in a cart, and had now reformed it, by appointing the Levites to carry it on their ſhoulders according to the Law: and he conſidered
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42229:189"/>
beſides, that for many other things the Lord might have taken advantage againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and puniſhed them as formerly; and therefore preſently by way of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he ſacrificed oxen and fatlings; and indeed ſo much is plainly intimated, 1, Chron. 15.26. where alſo the number of the ſacrifices offered is expreſſed; <hi>And it came to paſſe when God helped the Levites that bare the Ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered ſeven bullocks and ſeven rammes.</hi> And ſecondly, by way of imploring Gods mercy, that he would ſhew them favour in the reſt of the way, as he had done hitherto. The remembrance of that dolefull diſaſter that befell Uzzah, made him the more fearfull, and ſo the more carefull to ſeek Gods favour.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And David was girded with a linen ephod.]</hi> That is, a linen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like that of the Prieſts ephod; which doubtleſſe he put on, not onely that he might be lighter to dance before the ark, but alſo to ſhew his devotion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And they brought in the ark of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſet it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it.]</hi> For the tabernacle and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of burnt-offerings which Moſes had made, were both ſtill at Gibeon: 2. Chron. 1.3, 4. <hi>So Solomon and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon: for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moſes the ſervant of the Lord had made in the wilderneſſe. But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim, to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jeruſalem:</hi> and 1. Chron. 21.29. <hi>For the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Lord which Moſes made in the wilderneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the altar of the burnt-offerings, were at that ſeaſon in the high place at Gibeon.</hi> At this time Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid did alſo deliver to the Levites a Pſalme to be ſung before the ark, as we may ſee, 1. Chron. 16.7, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Then David returned to bleſſe his houſhold.]</hi> That is, to rejoyce with them in private, and to worſhip God with them, and to crave a bleſſing from God on them, as he had done on the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How glorious was the king of Iſrael to day, who uncovered himſelf to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his ſervants,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, who forgetting or caſting off the reſpect of his regall dignity, both in apparell and behaviour, mixed himſelf with the baſe multitude, dancing and leaping in the open ſtreets, as fools will do and vain men, when they are hired to make others ſport, <hi>as one of the vain fellows ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely uncovereth himſelf.</hi> Some conceive, that whileſt David danced, having onely a looſe linen garment upon him, ſome part of his bare legs or thighs might be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which they judge the more probable, becauſe his wife upbraids him that he had uncovered himſelf <hi>in the eyes of the handmaids.</hi> But I conceive there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, that the diſcovering his naked skin ſhould be hereby meant, but onely that laying by his princely attire, he had uſed light behaviour, not beſeeming the gravity of a king, and had thereby expoſed himſelf to the ſcorn and contempt of every girl that came to ſee the pomp of this removall of the ark.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And David ſaid unto Michal, It was before the Lord, which choſe me before thy father,</hi> &amp;c.] Conſidering how grievous a thing it is to any woman to be upbraided with the faults and miſeries of her parents, and how farre every hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is bound to bear with the infirmities of his wife, as the weaker veſſel, it may ſeem that David was ſomewhat too tart in this reply of his upon his wife; for it muſt
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42229:190"/>
needs cut her to the heart to heare her ſelf twitted with the Lords rejecting of her father and his family. But indeed David had juſt cauſe to be thus ſharp, not onely becauſe the flouts and inſolencies of a wife are moſt inſufferable; but alſo eſpecially becauſe it was his zeal and devotion in the ſervice of God, which ſhe derided; that it was, that chiefly moved his ſpirit, that it ſhould be caſt in his teeth as a matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and diſparagement, that he had humbled himſelf ſo in a way of religion; which was indeed a reproching of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul, had no child unto the day of her death.]</hi> And thus when David came to bleſſe his houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Michal by her ſinne brought a curſe upon it. If ſhe were barren before (as indeed we read not of any children ſhe had hitherto) yet Davids prayers might have prevailed for this bleſſing; but now becauſe of this wickedneſſe, God adjudged her to perpetuall barrenneſſe, and ſo ſhe died childleſſe.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd it came to paſſe when the king ſat in his houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] This clauſe <hi>when the king ſat in his houſe,</hi> is here inſerted, Firſt, to imply, though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more obſcurely, what is afterwards more fully expreſſed, to wit, that David for the preſent had reſt from warre, he ſat quietly in his houſe, <hi>the Lord had given him reſt round about from all his enemies,</hi> (as it follows in the next words) and ſo being freed from former troubles, he began to think of further promoting the cauſe of religion, and of building a temple for the ark, which he had lately brought to Jeruſalem. And ſecondly, to intimate what it was that made him think of building a temple, to wit, that he was come to dwell in that ſtately houſe, which he had built for himſelf (for the building whereof Hiram had ſent him, both cedar trees, and carpenters, and maſons, chap. 5.11,) and ſo ſitting in this his palace, he began to think with himſelf, how unreaſonable it was, that he ſhould dwell in ſuch a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe, and the ark of God ſhould be lodged the whileſt in a poore tent or taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle: for though when the people of Iſrael removed from one place to another, the Lord choſe to dwell in a tent which might be removed, yet now that Iſrael had been a long time ſettled in the land which God had given them, it was no longer neceſſary that Gods dwelling place ſhould be a tent; and therefore David conceived, that his purpoſe of building a ſettled houſe for God, would not be a croſſing of that which God himſelf had ordered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in chooſing a tent to be his dwelling place.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Nathan ſaid to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart,</hi> &amp;c.] Yet afterwards by expreſſe direction from God, he was appointed to croſſe this which now he ſaid; whereby is manifeſt, that the Prophets had not alwayes the ſpirit of prophecy upon them, but ſpake ſometimes as private men, as Samuel did, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Whereas I have not dwelt in any houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince the time that I brought up the children of Iſrael out of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Davids intent was generally in it ſelf good, inſomuch that the Lord himſelf commended him for it, as is manifeſt in that place before cited, 1. Kings 8.18. yet it was not without ſome mixture of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for herein he failed, becauſe he undertook to do it without any particular dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or warrant from God, led hereto onely by the judgement of his own reaſon, that it was not fit God ſhould dwell within curtains, when he dwelt in an houſe of cedar; and therefore though the Lord told him that his purpoſe was in the generall commendable, yet withall he rejected his purpoſe, and diſcovered thereby that he ſhould have waited his leaſure and direction, and diſproved his reaſon, ſhewing that till he required a Temple to be built, the ark was altogether as well in a tabernacle, as in a Temple; which was evident, becauſe he had never charged any of the Judges with this fault, <hi>Why build ye not me an houſe of cedar?</hi> See the note upon 1. Chron. 17.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, I took the from the ſheep-cote from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42229:191"/>
the ſheep,</hi> &amp;c.] That David might not be diſcouraged, and fear that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition that he ſhould not go forward in the work intended, did proceed from the Lords diſregarding of him, or from any diſpleaſure the Lord had conceived againſt him (as a loving wife will grieve if her husband refuſe any ſervice ſhe proffers to do him) in theſe following words he ſhews how well he eſteemed of him, both by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting what he had done for him, &amp; by promiſing what he would do more. But yet withall, in theſe words, <hi>I took thee from the ſheep-cote,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be ruler over my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> the Lord implies, that in doing this, for which he had exalted him, in ruling his people, he might ſufficiently approve his thankfulneſſe to God, and leave the care of building a Temple, to whom God ſhould chooſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. (<hi>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Iſrael, and will plant them,</hi> &amp;c.] This paſſage included in our Bibles in a Parentheſis, is very intricate and obſcure. According to our tranſlation, the meaning I conceive is this. Becauſe the glory and happines of a king, depends much upon the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>perous and flouriſhing eſtate of his people; therefore the Lord doth promiſe David, that the Iſraelites ſhould be now ſettled peaceably and quietly in the land of Canaan, and ſhould not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted and oppreſſed, as they had formerly been in the dayes of the Judges; <hi>I will appoint a place,</hi> ſaith the Lord <hi>and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more,</hi> that is, I will now ſettle them ſo in the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, that they ſhall quietly enjoy it, as their own lawfull inheritance, and not be diſpoſſeſſed and toſſed up and down, as formerly they have been; <hi>neither ſhall the children of wickedneſſe afflict them any more, as before time;</hi> that is, neither ſhall they be moleſted and vexed continually by their oppreſſing neighbours, as in former times they have been (and obſervable it is, that ſpeaking of thoſe that had afflicted and diſtreſſed the poore people of God, he terms them in that reſpect, <hi>children of wickedneſſe) and as ſince the time that I commanded Judges to be over my people Iſrael, and have cauſed thee to rest from all thine enemies,</hi> that is, and as they have been oppreſſed, ever ſince that I appointed Judges to govern and defend them, even unto this time, that I have now given thee peace and reſt, from thine enemies round about. This I conceive muſt needs be the meaning of this paſſage, according to our tranſlation: for though it may be queſtioned, why the Lord ſhould ſay, <hi>I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a place for my people Iſrael—that they may dwell in a place of their own.</hi> Since God had done this long ſince (he had long ſince appointed the land of Canaan to be theirs, and had driven out the inhabitants that had dwelt in it before, &amp; had put them into poſſeſſion of it, and they had enjoyed it as their own for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) yet for anſwer to this, we muſt know, that becauſe hitherto the Philiſtines and other of the old inhabitants of Canaan, had ſtill kept ſome good part of the land from them, and by them and other neighbouring nations, they had been hitherto ever and anon moleſted, they being ſtill ready upon all advantages to challenge their land, and to ſeek to wreſt it from them; therefore the Lord ſpeaks of the peaceable poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the land, as a thing that was not yet made good to them; but ſhould be now in the dayes of David and Solomon. And whereas again it may be objected, that much ſeems here to be promiſed, which was never made good to the Iſraelites, as that the Lord would ſo <hi>plant them in a place of their own,</hi> that they ſhould thence <hi>move no more,</hi> and that <hi>the children of wickedneſſe</hi> ſhould not <hi>afflict them any more,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:42229:191"/>
as before time.</hi> &amp;c. whereas we ſee, that after Solomons dayes, both the kingdome of Iſrael and Judah, were often invaded and waſted by many of the neighbouring nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that the Iſraelites were at laſt carried captive to Aſſyria and Babylon, and other countries; to this the anſwer muſt be, that either this muſt be reſtrained to the time of David and Solomon his ſonne, in whoſe time the Iſraelites did at laſt peaceably enjoy their land as their own, without any moleſtation from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring nations; or elſe it muſt be underſtood as a conditionall promiſe, God reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving liberty to himſelf, to deal otherwiſe with them, if they ſhould rebell againſt him (and indeed accordingly we ſee how marvelouſly they flouriſhed, till in the end of Solomons reigne they fell again to idolatry) or elſe we muſt expect the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment hereof, when this people ſhall come in to Chriſt, and ſo ſhall be planted again in their own land, never to be removed thence any more, nor ever more to be afflicted by the children of wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Alſo the Lord telletb thee, that he will make thee an houſe.]</hi> That is, that he will rear up of thy poſterity, on whom the kingdome ſhall be eſtabliſhed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, from one generation to another, till it comes at laſt to be eſtabliſhed in Chriſt: ſee the note, Exod. 1.21.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>He ſhall build an houſe for my name.]</hi> That is, a houſe for my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice; of which ſee the note, Deut. 12.4. and it is meant of Solomons building the Temple; for though David in his life time prepared great ſtore of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls for this great work, 1. Chron. 22.14. and did alſo give unto Solomon the pattern of the houſe, and the ſervices thereof, which he had received from the Lord, 1. Chron. 28.11. <hi>Then David gave to Solomon his ſonne the pattern of the porch,</hi> &amp;c. and again, verſ. 19. <hi>All this, ſaid David, the Lord made me underſtand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern,</hi> yet David laid not ſo much as the foundation of the building, but Solomon began and finiſhed the work, 1. Kings 5.1. &amp;c. But withall it is meant likewiſe of Chriſt the ſonne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, by whom onely the Church is built, that houſe of God of which the Temple was a type, 1. Pet. 3.5. <hi>Ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy prieſthood, to offer up spirituall ſacrifice acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>I will be his father, and he ſhall be my ſonne,</hi> &amp;c.] This clauſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo meant both of Solomon, and Chriſt. That it is meant of Solomon is clear, 1. Chron. 28.6. where this propheſie is repeated, <hi>Solomon thy ſonne he ſhall build my houſe, and my courts; for I have choſen him to be my ſonne, and I will be his father;</hi> and that it is alſo meant of Chriſt is as evident, Heb. 1.5. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle proves by this place, that Chriſt was farre above the angels; <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my ſonne, this day have I begotten thee? and Again, I will be to him a father, and he ſhall be to me a ſonne?</hi> Indeed the following clauſe cannot be meant of Chriſt, <hi>If he commit iniquity I will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten him,</hi> &amp;c. for though ſinne was imputed to Chriſt, Iſaiah 53.6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all:</hi> yet it cannot be therefore ſaid of Chriſt, that he did <hi>commit iniquity.</hi> The rule therefore for underſtanding theſe propheticall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, is this, That onely thoſe paſſages are to be applyed to Chriſt wherein Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was a type of Chriſt; the firſt therefore is meant both of Solomon and Chriſt, <hi>I will be his father, and he ſhall be my ſonne,</hi> but in a different reſpect, God was
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42229:192"/>
a father to Solomon by adoption and grace, to Chriſt, by naturall generation; but then the ſecond, is meant onely of Solomon, <hi>If he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the ſtripes of the children of men,</hi> and thereby ſome underſtand that men ſhould be the rods wherewith Solomon ſhould be chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and ſo indeed it was with Solomon when he fell to idolatry in his latter dayes, God corrected him for this, by the rebellions of Hadad, and Rezon, and Jeroboam againſt him, 1, Kings 11.14, &amp;c. but rather I conceive the meaning is, either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that as men uſe to correct their ſonnes, whom they love moſt dearly, ſo God would correct Solomon, though he would not caſt him off as he caſt off Saul, yet he would make him ſmart for it, if he ſinned againſt him; or elſe that God would cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him with moderation and gentleneſſe: for indeed, gentle correction may well be termed <hi>the rod of men, and the ſtripes of the children of men,</hi> both becauſe ſuch correction is fitted to the weakneſſe of men, and becauſe men are wont ſo to correct their children with a light and gentle hand; or elſe in oppoſition to the ſtrokes of Gods revenging juſtice: for as the heavineſſe of Gods judgements upon Babylon is implyed in that expreſſion, Iſa. 47.3. <hi>I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man;</hi> ſo on the contrary, Gods gentleneſſe may be well intended by this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>I will chaſten him with the rod of men, and with the ſtripes of the children of men.</hi> If God ſhould plead againſt us <hi>with his great power,</hi> as Job ſpeaks, chap. 23.6. it would ſoon grind us to powder; but his purpoſe in ſmiting his children is onely to amend and not to deſtroy, and therefore he doth it with great moderation and pitie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>But my mercy ſhall not depart away from him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I will not caſt him off from being king, as I did Saul: It is not that mercy which is the portion of Gods redeemed ones, of which the Lord ſaith here, that it ſhould not depart away from Solomon, as he took it from Saul; for Saul never had any ſhare in this mercy, and where God affords this mercy, he never takes it away. But the mercy here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is onely that of continuing the kingdome to him: this mercy the Lord ſaith ſhould not depart from Solomon, he would not utterly caſt him off from being king as David had ſeen Saul caſt off, whence is that laſt clauſe, <hi>whom I put away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And thine houſe and thy kingdome ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever before thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe words <hi>before thee,</hi> are added, becauſe his kingdome ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in him unto the day of his death, and ſhould whileſt he yet lived, be ſettled upon his ſonne, and ſo ſhould continue in his poſterity, they ſeeing and enjoying it till the coming of Chriſt, in whom it ſhould be eſtabliſhed for ever.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>According to all theſe words, and according to all this viſion, ſo did Nathan ſpeak unto David.]</hi> And herein did Nathan approve his integrity and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; he was not aſhamed at Gods command to unſay and recant what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid, and to contradict the counſel which himſelf had given to David, ver. 3. <hi>And Nathan ſaid to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart, for the Lord is with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Then went king David in, and ſat before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he went into the tent where the ark was, and continued there before the Lord: for the Hebrew word here uſed, ſignifies as properly and uſually <hi>to remain and abide in a
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:42229:192"/>
place,</hi> or <hi>at a thing,</hi> as <hi>to ſit,</hi> as Gen. 27.44. Lev. 14.8. 1. Sam. 1.22. and 20.19. I deny not but that perhaps David might in theſe his private ſoliloquies, even ſitting (as elſewhere walking, and lying in his bed) powre forth his ſoul unto the Lord in prayer, as Moſes prayed ſitting, Exod. 17.12. <hi>But Moſes hands were heavy, and they took a ſtone and put under him, and he ſat thereon:</hi> and Elijah, 1. Kings 19.4. <hi>But he himſelf went a dayes journey into the wilderneſſe, and came and ſat down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a juniper tree: and he requested for himſelf that he might die, and ſaid, It is enough now, O Lord, take away my life.</hi> But the more probable opinion is, either that by this word <hi>(ſat)</hi> is meant, tarried before the Lord, or elſe that he at firſt ſat down in the tabernacle, and meditated of Gods goodneſſe and mercy to him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards addreſſed himſelf to pray unto the Lord, &amp; that kneeling, as the greateſt of Gods ſervants were wont to do; Pſal. 95.6. <hi>O come, let us worſhip and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our maker:</hi> 1. Kings 8.54. <hi>It was ſo, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and ſupplication unto the Lord, he aroſe from the altar of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from kneeling on his knees, with his hands ſpread up to heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And is this the manner of man, O Lord God?]</hi> That is, this is not the manner of man. And ſome Expoſitours underſtand this thus, that the ſettling of ſuch bleſſings, as God had promiſed, upon his poſterity, was not according to the law of nature, that children ſhould inherit the eſtates and honours of their parents, but of Gods mere grace and good will to them. But there is more I conceive then this intended in theſe words: David having acknowledged the great goodneſſe of God, in promiſing the kingdome to his ſeed after him, and eſpecially in aſſuring him that his ſeed ſhould be the Sonne of God, and ſhould rule over his people for ever, he breaks forth at length into an admiration of this wonderfull goodneſſe and mercy of God, <hi>And is this the manner of man, O Lord God?</hi> thereby implying either that it was not the manner of man to afford ſuch favour of mere grace, above all deſert, or to deal ſo freely and familiarly with thoſe that are beneath them, as God had dealt with him; or elſe that this goodneſſe and mercy of God, eſpecially in giving his own Sonne to be made man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he might redeem them to himſelf, that were before the enemies of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſlaves of Sathan, and ſo rule over them as his own peculiar people, was far above the mercy that could be expected from the moſt gracious and mercifull man; or elſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that poore baſe man could not be in any degree worthy of ſuch mercies as thoſe were, nor indeed capable of them, according to the ordinary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man; and ſo is this place parallel with that Pſal. 8.4. <hi>What is man that thou art mindfull of him? or the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> which the Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies particularly to Gods mercy, in the incarnation of his onely begotten ſonne; and the advantages and honour that redound to man by this, and by the work of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption performed by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heb. 2.6 &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And what can David ſay more unto thee? for thou Lord God knowest thy ſervant.]</hi> The firſt clauſe here, <hi>And what can David ſay more unto thee?</hi> may be underſtood two ſeverall wayes, either that David knew not how to ask more then God of his own free grace had promiſed him, and was ready to conferre upon him, and indeed as this paſſage of Davids prayer is expreſſed, 1. Chron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.18. it ſeems beſt to bear this ſenſe, <hi>And what can David ſpeak more to thee, for the honour of thy ſervant?</hi> But then the meaning of the next clauſe
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42229:193"/>
is this, <hi>For thou knoweſt thy ſervant,</hi> that is, thou knoweſt what is good for me, thou knoweſt my wants and deſires better then I can diſcover them to thee, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of our Saviours, Matth. 6.8. <hi>Your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask them:</hi> or elſe, that he was not able to expreſſe how highly he eſteemed of that goodneſſe and mercy he had ſhewne to him; and then the next words, <hi>for thou Lord knoweſt thy ſervant,</hi> are added to imply, that God knew well enough the motions and deſires of his heart to praiſe his name, though with his tongue he was not able to expreſſe them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>According to thine own heart, hast thou done all theſe great things to make thy ſervant know them.]</hi> That is, of thine own free grace haſt thou made all theſe glorious promiſes to me and mine, that thy ſervant might know what thou meaneſt to do, for him and his, in time to come.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And to do for you great things and terrible,</hi> &amp;c.] By a certain figure called Apoſtrophe, David being now ſpeaking to God, turneth his ſpeech as it were abruptly, to the people of God, <hi>And to do for you</hi> (that is, for you O Iſrael) <hi>great things,</hi> and then in the next words directs his ſpeech again to God, <hi>for thy land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy people which thou redeemedſt to thee from Egypt, from the nations, and their gods,</hi> delivering them from all the nations that fought their ruine, and from the falſe gods on whom their enemies relyed for help: ſo that here David joyns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the deliverance of the Iſraelites both from the Egyptians, and from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, and other nations that ſought to oppreſſe them; as it is alſo expreſſed, 1. Chron. 17.21. <hi>What one nation in the earth is like thy people Iſrael, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatneſſe and terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by driving out the nations from before thy people whom thou haſt redeemed out of Egypt?</hi> See the note upon, Exod. 12.12.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd after this it came to paſſe, that David ſmote the Philiſtines, and ſubdued them.]</hi> In this chapter the warres and victories of David are recorded, both to diſcover one cauſe amongſt others, why the Lord appointed him to give over his purpoſe of building the temple, to wit, becauſe he ſhould not have leaſure to do it, by reaſon of his many warres; and alſo to ſhew how the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his promiſes made to David in the former chapter, concerning the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and flouriſhing eſtate of his kingdome and people.</p>

Sam. 22.3, 4. <hi>David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab, and he ſaid unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth and be with you, till I know what God will do for me. And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</hi> Yet when David was once eſtabliſhed king of Iſrael, it is likely the Moabites bare now the ſame hoſtile mind againſt David, which they had formerly againſt Saul, and might give juſt occaſion to David to make warre againſt them: yea indeed the Lord had commanded the Iſraelites alwayes to account them enemies, Deut, 23.6. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſeek their peace, nor their proſperity, all thy dayes for ever;</hi> and thereupon, <hi>he ſmote Moab and meaſured them with a line,</hi> that is, he did ſo abſolutely vanquiſh them, that they were wholly at his mercy, he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them as ſeemed good to himſelf, ſlaying and ſparing whom he pleaſed, and had made ſuch havock in the countrey, levelling their towns and cities with the ground, that it lay open before him to be meaſured with a line, to be divided and diſpoſed of, as a place newly to be planted and inhabited; this phraſe of meaſuring with a line, is grounded upon the cuſtome of abſolute conquerours, who having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a land into their power, do divide it amongſt thoſe that ſhall dwell in it, as the Iſraelites did the land of Canaan, or elſe, it is a ſimilitude borrowed from husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that meaſure out land, ſome for tillage, ſome for wood, ſome for paſture; or rather from carpenters, who with a line ſtrike their timber to ſet out how much ſhall be hewed off, and how much reſerved for the building; implying that even ſo Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid ſlew and kept alive of the Moabites taken priſoners whom he pleaſed, <hi>even with two lines meaſured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive,</hi> that is, he ſlew two third parts of the people, and one third part he kept alive, that the land might not lie wholly deſolate, and ſo now was that propheſie in part ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, Numb. 24.17. <hi>There ſhall come a ſtarre out of Jacob, and a ſceptre ſhall riſe out of Iſrael, and ſhall ſmite the corners of Moab, and deſtroy all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Sheth;</hi> and Moab became Davids waſhpot, as David ſung, Pſal. 60.8. <hi>Moab is my waſhpot, over Edom will I cast my ſhoe,</hi> which was compoſed at this time.</p>

Others conceive indeed, that it is David of whom it is here ſaid, that <hi>he went to recover his border, at the river Euphrates,</hi> &amp; that upon that occaſion he vanquiſhed Hadadezer, that ſought to oppoſe him; but however, thus that prophecy was in part fulfilled, Gen. 15.18. that the Lord would give unto Abrahams ſeed that land, even unto the great river Euphrates, that countrey becoming now tributary to David: and upon the occaſion of this victory, David compoſed the 60 Pſalme, as is evident in the title before expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And David took from him a thouſand chariots, and ſeven hundred horſemen,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſeven hundred decuries, ſeven hundred companies or ranks of horſemen, having tenne in each company, or in each rank: for ſo it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be expounded, to reconcile this with, 1. Chron. 18.4. where it is ſaid, that David took from them <hi>ſeven thouſand horſemen,</hi> unleſſe the chief be here onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and all there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And David houghed all the chariot horſes,</hi> &amp;c.] He reſerved onely for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred chariots, as having reſpect to that which God had ſaid of the kings of Iſrael, Deut. 17.16. <hi>But he ſhall not multiply horſes to himſelf, nor cauſe the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Egypt, to the end that he ſhould multiply horſes,</hi> the reſt he houghed to make them unſerviceable for the warres, though uſefull otherwayes, as we ſee the like done by the Lords direction, Joſh. 11.6. <hi>Thou ſhalt hough their horſes, and burn their chariots with fire.</hi>

And as for the number of the enemies ſlain, which is diverſely related here, and 1. Chron. 18.12. and in the title of the 60. Pſalme, the moſt probable opinion is, that Abiſhai did at firſt ſet on them, and ſlew ſix thouſand, that afterward Joab came upon them, and ſlew twelve thouſand moe, as is expreſſed, Pſal. 60. in the title, all which together, makes eighteen thouſand as here; which whole ſumme of eighteen thouſand is aſcribed to Abiſhai, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And he put garriſons in Edom,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus they became tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and had hence forth, even unto the dayes of Jehoſaphat, a vice-roy or deputy appointed over them, 1. Kings 22.47. <hi>There was no king in Edom, a Deputy was king.</hi> That prophecy therefore concerning Eſau and Jacob, that the elder ſhould ſerve the younger, Gen. 25.23. began now to be litterally accompliſhed: more of this ſtory, and of the flight of Hadad into Egypt, ſee 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And Joab the ſonne of Zeruiah was over the hoſt.]</hi> Joab was the ſonne of Zeruiah Davids ſiſter, but was made Generall of his forces, becauſe of that exploit of his, in winning the caſtle of Sion from the Jebuſites, 1.

Chron. 6.4.8. and was afterward by Solomon made high prieſt, in the room of Abiathar, 1. Kings 2.35. Ahimelech the other prieſt here named, was of the ſtock of Ithamar, and as it ſeems, the ſonne of Abiathar, who fled to David from Saul, 1. Sam. 22.20. theſe were the prieſts in Davids time, that is, they were the two chief prieſts of theſe two ſeverall ſtocks, and had the chief command (under the high prieſt Abiathar the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Ahimelech) of the other prieſts, each over the prieſts of his own family: for David had divided the prieſts into two parts, according to the two families of Eleazar and Ithamar, 1. Chron. 24.3.4. <hi>And David diſtributed them, both Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok of the ſonnes of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the ſonnes of Ithamar, according to their offices in their ſervice. And there were moe chief men found of the ſonnes

The moſt probable opinion is this, that they were two bands of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſouldiers, choſen to attend upon the kings perſon, as his guard, at leaſt in their courſes, chap. 15.18. <hi>And all his ſervants paſſed on beſide him; and all the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites ſix hundred men, which came after him from Gath, paſſed on before the king:</hi> and 20 7. <hi>And there went out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him Joabs men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jeruſalem, to purſue after Sheba the ſonne of Bichri:</hi> and 1.

Some derive their names from certain Hebrew words, which may imply, that the Chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites were the kings executioners that did cut off malefactours, and the Pelethites were excellent men, and choſen to defend his perſon: but becauſe we find, that the Philiſtines were called Cherethites, 1.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42229:195"/>
hitherto encumbred, and beſides, we know that in the ſacred Hiſtory all things are not ſet down in the very ſame order wherein they were done: and for the ſecond, we muſt conſider, firſt, that David having lived as an exile both from the court and kingdome of Iſrael a long time, might happely know nothing of this child of Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans when he came to the crown: ſecondly, that the friends of Saul might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely conceal him for fear of David: thirdly, that David was not through jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and fear inquiſitive after Sauls poſterity: and fourthly, that there is no cauſe why we ſhould be ſo ſolicitous to clear David from being too remiſſe in taking care of performing the covenant which he had made with Jonathan. However obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable it is, that when he enquired whether there were any left of Sauls family he expreſſed the reaſon, <hi>That I may ſhew him kindneſſe for Jonathans ſake:</hi> for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this was added purpoſely, that his courtiers might not forbear to deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, for fear he ſhould enquire after them with an ill intent.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Is there not yet any of the houſe of Saul, that I may ſhew the kindneſſe of God unto him?]</hi> That is, that great kindneſſe that in the preſence of God I promiſed to Jonathan; or the kindneſſe which God ſheweth to the fatherleſſe and afflicted, yea to his very enemies, and which he likewiſe requires, that we ſhould ſhew to them that are in diſtreſſe and miſery, that we may be like herein to God. All this may be comprehended in this expreſſion; and it was indeed in the very ſame tearms challenged from David when Jonathan made a covenant with him, 1. Sam. 20.14, 15. <hi>And thou ſhalt not onely while yet I live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhew me the kindneſſe of the Lord that I die not: But alſo thou ſhalt not cut off thy kindneſſe from my houſe for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Sam. 11.1, 11. and had continuall warre with him, 1. Sam. 14.47. Indeed we reade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, chap. 8.12. of ſpoyls taken by David from the children of Ammon; but that is meant of this warre which here the ſacred Hiſtory enters upon; for till this time David moleſted them not.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Wherefore Hanun took Davids ſervants, and ſhaved off the one half of their beards,</hi> &amp;c.] Doubtleſſe becauſe he deſired to expoſe theſe embaſſadours of David, to the deriſion and ſcorn of every one that ſhould ſee them; therefore he choſe to ſhave off onely the one half of their beards; yet it may well be that he did the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pitch upon this way of diſgracing them, as it were in contempt of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe by the Law of God they were forbidden to cut or ſhave their beards at all, even in their greateſt mourning: Lev. 19.27. <hi>Ye ſhall not round the corners of your heads, neither ſhalt thou marre the corners of thy beard.</hi> And indeed, why elſe did David when he heard of this, verſ. 5. appoint them to tarry at Jericho till their beards were grown; when the Ammonites had ſhaven off one half of their beards, it had been an eaſie matter by ſhaving off the other half, to have taken away the deformity of half a beard; and at the worſt, they had onely then looked as they did in their younger years: but it ſeems the ſhaving of their beards at all, was in it ſelf a reproch to the Iſraelites, and therefore he would not ſuffer them to ſtirre abroad, till their beards were grown on the other ſide. As for that other diſgrace he put upon them, to wit, that <hi>he cut off their garments to the middle, even to their buttocks,</hi> that was a greater reproch then the other, becauſe the Iſraelites wore not breeches, as we do, but onely long looſe garments, and the diſcovering of thoſe parts, by the light of nature all men abhorre; whence is that of the Prophet, concerning the ſtripping of the Egyptians that ſhould be carried away captives, Iſa. 20.4. <hi>So ſhall the king of Aſſyria lead away the Egyptians priſoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the ſhame of Egypt.</hi>

Indeed it was long after this ere the citie Jericho was built up again, as we ſee 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>The children of Ammon ſent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe Syrians he hired with <hi>a thouſand talents of ſilver,,</hi> and with theſe here mentioned thoſe alſo of Meſopotamia, and two and thirty thouſand chariots, 1. Chron, 19.6, 7. <hi>When the children of Ammon ſaw that they had made themſelves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon ſent a thouſand talents of ſilver, to hire them chariots and horſemen out of Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia, and out of Syria Maachah, and out of Zobah. So they hired thirty and two thouſand chariots:</hi> who were all ready enough to engage themſelves in this warre, as hoping to free themſelves from that yoke which David had laid upon them, and to revenge that loſſe they had formerly received; for he had lately vanquiſhed them, and made them a tributary people, chap. 8.6. <hi>Then David put garriſons in Syria of Damaſcus, and the Syrians became ſervants to David, and brought gifts.</hi>

Chron. 19.7. <hi>So they hired thirty and two thouſand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and pitched before Medeba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Iſhtob, and Maacah, were by themſelves in the field.</hi> &amp;c.] To the end that they might hemme in the Iſraelites, and ſet upon them both in the front and in the rear, the Syrians were appointed to pitch by themſelves in a place of the field apart from the Ammonites, either openly or in ſecret, as lying in ambuſh (for they would not truſt theſe their mercenary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliaries of the Syrians, with the guard of the city) and the Ammonites themſelves pitched their ſouldiers before the citie.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus Joab did encourage his captains and ſouldiers to fight valiantly; firſt, by putting them in mind that they were to fight for their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and people, to defend them againſt cruell adverſaries, who if they prevailed,

After thoſe victories obtained, whereof mention is before made, the winter approching, David and his captains gave over the proſecuting of their new conqueſt in the land of the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites: but in the Spring of the next yeare (which was the uſuall time when in thoſe countreys they went out to warre, becauſe then they had the Summer before them, for the perfecting of any hard ſiege they ſhould undertake, and then in thoſe regions both graſſe and corn began to ripen and ſo they might have food and relief both for themſelves and their horſes) David ſent out Joab with a great army to perfect the conqueſt of the Ammonites, which the yeare before they had begun, and ſo <hi>beſieged Rabbah,</hi> the chief city of the Ammonites, afterwards called Philadelphia.</p>

Firſt, he went not out himſelf to war againſt the Ammonites as formerly he had wont to do, but ſent out Joab, as is expreſſed in the former verſe: and ſecondly, being at home, he gave himſelf to his eaſe; having ſpent ſome good part of the day in ſtretching himſelf upon his bed, in the evening he aroſe and walked upon the roof of his houſe, (which were amongſt the Jews built flat upon the top) and ſo was there entangled with the ſight of Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42229:197"/>
As long as David was perſecuted by Saul he kept cloſe to God, nor do we read of any ſcandalous ſinnes he fell into, but when he was ſettled in the kingdome, and ſo lived in the plentie, pomp, and ſtate that became ſo great a king, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when he came to take ſuch liberty for his eaſe, as to lie upon his bed at noon and to ſpend his time in walking upon his houſe top, then we ſee into what a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinne he fell with this wife of Uriah. Running ſtreams are clear and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but ſtanding waters are uſually muddy and unſavoury, and apt to gather all kind of filth and corruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And from the roof he ſaw a woman waſhing her ſelf.]</hi> To wit, to purifie her ſelf from her menſtruall uncleanneſſe according to the law, Levit. 15.27, 28. for ſo it is expreſſed. verſ. 4. <hi>For ſhe was purified from her uncleanneſſe.</hi> It is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed, that Bathſheba would waſh her ſelf, eſpecially in this kind, where ſhe thought any body might ſee her, but onely her ſervants that were with her; but luſt is quick ſighted, and ſome want of warineſſe and care it ſeems there was in her, and ſo David eſpied her from the top of his houſe, and ſo by that means his eye proved an inlet of luſt into his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And David ſent and enquired after the woman.]</hi> When the ſight of naked Bathſheba had kindled luſtfull thoughts and deſires in Davids heart, had he preſently caſt out thoſe unclean motions, and ſet his mind upon better things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he had never gone further; but we ſee he went on thinking of the ſight he had ſeen and ſent to enquire what woman it was, and ſo ſuffering the poyſoned ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to lie rankling in his heart, at length the wound grew incurable, and he could not be ſatisfied till he had enjoyed her.</p>
                  <p>

Chron. 3.5. as alſo Eliam her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there called Ammiel. Why Uriah is called the Hittite, we may ſee by that which is noted, 1. Sam. 26.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>For ſhe was purified from her uncleanneſſe.]</hi> That is, from her menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uncleanneſſe, Lev. 18.19. and hereby ſhe was the more apt to conceive.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the warre proſpered.]</hi> Thus we ſee how David faultered in ſeeking ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

pretences for fetching home ſuch a worthy as Uriah was, from a ſervice of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, as was the ſiege of Rabbah? Alas, theſe things he might have known, and did dayly hear by every meſſenger that came from the camp; and enough it was to make Uriah ſuſpect ſome underhand plot, to ſee that he ſhould be ſent for upon ſo ſleight an occaſion, as to ſatisfie ſuch triviall queries as theſe were. But David was forced to diſſemble and pretend ſomewhat, and could not act this part arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And Uriah departed out of the kings houſe, and there followed him a meſſ of meat from the king.]</hi> To wit, that this might be an occaſion of inviting him to make merry with his wife, and ſo to lie with her.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah ſaid unto David; The ark, and Iſrael, and Judah abide in tents,</hi> &amp;c] They uſed in perillous warres to carry the ark with them into the camp, both as a teſtimony of Gods preſence, and that they might ask counſel of God as occaſion ſerved; as is evident, 1. Sam. 4.4. and 14.18. and therefore the moſt of Expoſitours conceive, that accordingly at this time, the ark was with Joab in the camp at the ſiege of Rabbah; and that this was the reaſon why Uriah ſpake of the arks abiding in tents, together with Iſrael and Judah: but yet becauſe it ſeems not probable, that they would carry the ark, the ſigne of Gods preſence amongſt his people out of the land of Canaan into the countrey of the Ammonites; I ſhould rather think, that being to ſpeak of the abiding of Iſrael and Judah in tents, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the ark was alſo in the tent which David had ſet up for it, chap. 6.17. Therefore onely it is, that he joyns the ark with Iſrael and Judah; <hi>The ark,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and Iſrael and Judah abide in tents, and my Lord Joab and the ſervants of my Lord are encamped in the open fields; ſhall I then go into mine houſe to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?</hi> &amp;c. But however, the drift of theſe words is evident, to wit, that Uriah herein rendred a reaſon why he would not go home to his houſe, namely, becauſe he judged it unfit and unreaſonable, that he ſhould take his eaſe and pleaſure, whileſt his Generall and his brethren lay abroad in continuall danger in the open fields: and then beſides, there was withall in theſe words, by the providence of God, a ſecret check given to David, that Uriah ſhould make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of taking pleaſure with his own wife, at a time when the people of God were in continuall danger, and yet David had not ſcrupled at that very time, to ſatisfie his luſt with the wife of Uriah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him, and made him drunk.]</hi> It is not probable, that Uriah that had ſo reſolutely refuſed to feaſt and frolick with his wife; would yeild to do that with the king, which he had refuſed to do with his wife; onely when David had invited him to his table, he thought it too much to reject the kings favour, and therefore reſolved to yeild here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the kings commandment no further then might ſtand with his reſolved courſe of auſterity; fully purpoſing not to let looſe himſelf to any delight or freedome in eating or drinking: but we ſee the event; by degrees he was overtaken and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which was that David aimed at, hoping that when he was heated with wine, he would then go home to his wife, which hitherto he had refuſed to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And at even he went out to lie on his bed with the ſervants of his lord, but went not down to his houſe.]</hi> He went not to ſleep as the night before, at the doore of the kings houſe, verſ. 9. (to wit, becauſe he had drunk too freely) but yet he went not home to his wife, but lay in the court amongſt the kings houſhold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: ſo that though he were a little overgone with exceſſe, yet he ſtill remembred and ſtuck to his former reſolution of not going home to his wife: A paſſage very obſervable, whileſt David uſed all his skill to get him home, doubtleſſe his wife was not wanting to act her part too: it cannot be thought, but that ſhe ſent and came to him again and again, and ſolicited him earneſtly to come home to her, (for it much concerned her) and yet all this could not move him; even when he was drunk he would not home to his houſe: for whence was this? doubtleſſe there was a ſecret hand of Providence in it; it is like enough he was diſpleaſed that he was ſo cauſeleſſely taken off from that noble enterpriſe of the ſiege of Rabbah, and deemed it unfitting, as he had ſaid before, to take his pleaſure, whileſt his brethren and fellow ſouldiers were in ſuch hard ſervice: but yet conſidering how many means were uſed to overcome him; we may well conclude, that there was a ſpeciall hand of Providence, in the firmneſſe of his reſolution; the Lord intending hereby to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terplot David, and not to ſuffer him to ſmother his ſinne, as he deſired to have done.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd the Lord ſent Nathan unto David,</hi> &amp;c.] It was now about three quarters of a yeare, ſince David committed that foul ſinne with the wife of Uriah (for the child ſhe then conceived, was now born, verſ. 14.) in all which time, though doubtleſſe his conſcience did often gall him, yet he ſtrived to harden himſelf againſt ſuch fears, and onely took care to conceal his ſinne that it might not be known (which yet he could not do; for however, he did it ſecretly, and had done what he could to keep it cloſe; yet by reaſon of his marriage with the wife of Uriah, &amp;c. it began now to be by ſome ſuſpected, and blazoned abroad; and therefore Nathan tells him, verſ. 14. that by this deed he had given great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the enemies of God to blaſpheme:) now therefore the Lord in mercy ſent Nathan to him, that he might be brought to confeſſe his ſinne, and unfainedly to riſe out of this ſad condition.</p>

For the intention and application of the Parable, it is this: by <hi>the rich man,</hi> that had <hi>exceeding many flocks and herds,</hi> he meant David, who had very many wives and concubines: by <hi>the poore man</hi> that had <hi>nothing, ſave one little ewe-lambe,</hi> is meant Uriah, who had it ſeems but one wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, Bathſheba; and ſhe is not onely compared to an ewe-lambe, but alſo to ſuch a lambe, as we uſe to call cade-lambes, or coſſet-lambes, which without a damme, are brought up by hand; and therefore it is ſaid, it was a lambe <hi>which he had bought</hi> (for husbands in thoſe times, uſed to give dowries for their wives) <hi>and nouriſhed up, and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat,</hi> (or as it is in the original, <hi>of his own morſell;</hi> implying, that though the poore man had but a little, yet he gave his darling lambe part of it) <hi>and drank of his own cup, and lay in his boſome:</hi> which doth ſweetly expreſſe the condition of a wife, whom the husband ought to eſteem his onely darling and delight, and make her a ſharer of all that he hath; as indeed men are the liker to do when they have but one wife. Again, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, verſ. 4. that <hi>There came a travailer into the rich man, and he ſpared to take of his own flock, and of his own herd, for the wayfaring man that was come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but took the poore mans lambe, and dreſſed it for the man that was come to him.</hi> By this traveller, or wayfaring man, for whoſe entertainment the rich man took away the poore mans ewe-lambe, is meant the devil, by means of whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was, that David incroached upon the bed of Uriah, and lay with his wife,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42229:199"/>
though he had ſo many wives and concubines of his own, and the alluſion is very fit: firſt, becauſe the devil may well be compared to a traveller, in regard of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall traverſing the earth, from one place to another, that he may tempt, and ſeduce men to ſinne; when the Lord asked Sathan whence he came, Job. 1.7. he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it;</hi> and S. Peter ſaith, 1. Pet. 5.8. that <hi>As a roaring lion, he walketh about ſeeking whom he may devoure:</hi> ſecondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe hereby is ſweetly implyed, a notable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the temptations of the regenerate, (ſuch as David was) and the ſinnes of wicked men; to the one the devil comes now and then, as a traveller, and wayfaring man, and finds for the time too good entertainment; but in the other, he dwels as a Lord and maſter, ruling and reigning in them at all times: and thirdly, becauſe when men eſpecially ſuch good men as David was, do give any entertainment to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils temptations, for the committing of any ſinne, they feaſt the devil herewith; it is meat and drink to him, to winne ſuch men to ſinne againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And he ſaid to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing ſhall ſurely die.]</hi> That is, he ſhall not onely reſtore the lambe fourefold according to the Law, Exod. 22.1. <hi>If a man ſhall ſteal an ox, or a ſheep, and kill it, or ſell it, he ſhall reſtore five oxen for an ox, and foure ſheep for a ſheep;</hi> but beſides, he ſhall be put to death: Thus David in his wrath threatens a heavier puniſhment then God in his Law had appointed; as accounting it ſuch a mercileſſe act, and ſo, ſuch a ſingular wickedneſſe, that fourefold reſtitution was not puniſhment enough; for ſo much he expreſſeth in the following words, verſ. 6. <hi>And he ſhall restore the lambe fourefold, becauſe he did this thing, and becauſe he had no pity:</hi> and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly paſſeth a moſt heavy ſentence againſt himſelf.</p>

Doubtleſſe it was unlawfull for David, to marry any of Sauls his father-in-laws wives, to wit, ſuch as he had carnally known; for ſhe that was Sauls wife, was Davids mother-in-law, and ſuch he might not marry, Levit. 18.8. <hi>The nakedneſſe of thy fathers wife thou ſhalt not uncover; it is thy fathers nakedneſſe:</hi> either therefore the meaning of theſe words, if meant of ſuch, muſt be onely this, that Sauls wives and concubines were in Davids power, that he might have taken them, though he did it not; or if it be conceived that David did indeed take to him any of Sauls wives or concubines, we muſt underſtand theſe words [<hi>I gave]</hi> onely of Gods bringing them into his power (though he made uſe of his power unlawfully) not of Gods approving of this fact of his againſt the Law, as in the like ſenſe this word is uſed again, verſ. 11. <hi>I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his ſight?]</hi> Becauſe when men embolden themſelves to do that which they know is contrary to Gods commandment, onely becauſe they can do it ſecretly, and no body ſhall come to know of it (and yet they cannot be ignorant that God is priuie to all they do) this is an evident argument, that in effect they make light of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42229:200"/>
Gods Law, and care not much for diſpleaſing God, ſo no other inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be like to come upon them; hence it is that the Prophet Nathan chargeth Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid with deſpiſing the commandment of the Lord, in doing that which was evil in his ſight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt killed Uriah the Hittite with the ſword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife,</hi> &amp;c.] Firſt, the perſon whom David had cauſed to be ſlain, is ſo expreſſely named, the rather becauſe Uriah was a man of ſuch eminency, one of Davids worthies, chap. 23.39. and one it ſeems that feared God, and was zealous for God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as appears by that he ſaid to David, chap. 11.11. <hi>The Ark, and Iſrael, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah abide in tents, and ſhall I then go home into mine houſe, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?</hi> and ſo the worth of the party murthered did much aggravate his ſinne. Secondly, even his marrying with Bathſheba is mentioned here as a branch of his ſinne; for becauſe he had accompliſhed this marriage by ſuch wicked means, to wit, by cauſing her husband to be killed, that he might marry her, and had done it purpoſely to conceal his adultery, and having brought this to paſſe, did now chucker himſelf, as if all had been well, even by this marriage he had highly provoked God to diſpleaſure againſt him. And thirdly, this is mentioned as a great aggravation of his ſinne, that he had ſlain Uriah <hi>with the ſword of the children of Ammon:</hi> and indeed there was much evil wrapped up in this: For firſt, there was a treachery in this; a ſinne which God greatly abhorres; they ſet him upon a deſperate ſervice, and then according to the plot they had laid, when he was engaged, they retired from him, and ſo baſely betrayed him to the ſword of the enemie: ſecondly, by this means many of Gods people were ſlain together with him: thirdly, the Ammonites were encouraged hereby, and took occaſion to inſult over Gods people, and over the truth and religion they profeſſed; yea, perhaps over the God of the Iſraelites, as regardleſſe of thoſe that ſerved him, or not able to protect thoſe that fought in his cauſe: and fourthly, the hearts of Gods people were exceedingly ſadded and diſcouraged thereby.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Now therefore the ſword ſhall never depart from thine houſe.]</hi> This may be referred not onely to the violent death of his three ſonnes Amnon, Abſalom, and Adonijah, who were all ſlain with the ſword; but alſo to the bloudy wars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the poſterity of David were continually moleſted, eſpecially betwixt them and the kings of Iſrael, the ſucceſſours of Jeroboam.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I will raiſe up evil againſt thee out of thine own houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] This is meant of Amnons inceſt, and Abſaloms rebellion, and other abominable wickedneſſe: for though God be not the authour of ſinne, yet his providence concurres in the worſt evils that men do: and ſo it did both in the rebellion and in the inceſt of Abſalom; concerning which, that is meant which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the next words, and <hi>I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he ſhall lie with thy wives in the ſight of this ſunne:</hi> where by his <hi>neighbour</hi> is meant one that was nigh to him; and who was nigher to him then his own ſonne; and it is ſaid that this ſhould be done before Davids eyes; becauſe it was done whileſt he lived, and he came to know of it; and <hi>in the ſight of the ſunne,</hi> becauſe Abſalom did it openly, <hi>in the ſight of all Iſrael,</hi> chap. 16.22. and in a tent which they ſpread for him in Jeruſalem, upon the top of the houſe; perhaps the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42229:200"/>
ſame houſe, from the roof whereof David did firſt caſt a luſtfull eye upon the wife of Uriah, chap. 11.2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>For thou didst it ſecretly; but I will do this thing before all Iſrael, and before the ſunne.]</hi> And thus God threatned to puniſh him with that, which ſhould be a ſhame and reproch to him amongſt all the people, becauſe he had been more afraid of ſhame amongſt men, then of his diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And David ſaid unto Nathan, I have ſinned againſt the Lord.]</hi> If we compare together Sauls confeſſion of his ſinne to Samuel, 1. Sam. 15.24.25. with this of Davids to Nathan, there ſeems better expreſſions of a true penitent in that of Sauls, then in this of Davids: for Saul confeſſed his ſinne in appearance more fully, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for I have tranſgreſſed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words, becauſe I feared the people, and obeyed their voice:</hi> beſides, he entreated for pardon, verſ. 25. and deſired Samuel that they might go and worſhip the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as it were to ſeek atonement with him. But now David onely ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord;</hi> which is the ordinary confeſſion of thoſe that moſt ſleight their ſinnes; and yet Saul was rejected, and David had an anſwer of pardon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returned to him. But for this we muſt know, that Davids heart was truly humbled, which Sauls was not, and thence was the difference: doubtleſſe David was ſo overwhelmed with ſhame and godly ſorrow, that he could not ſpeak, he could ſay no more, but <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord,</hi> and much ado perhaps he had to ſay that; but afterwards we ſee he confeſſed his ſinne more fully to the whole Church of God: for having penned the 51. Pſalme, (which contains his acknowledgement of this ſinne, and the profeſſion of his repentance) he committed it to the chief mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to be publiſhed in the ſanctuary, as by the title of the Pſalme we may ſee, <hi>To the chief muſician a Pſalme of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathſheba.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And Nathan ſaid unto David, The Lord alſo hath put away thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not die.]</hi> That is, neither eternally, nor by any ſudden ſtroke or judgement of God, both which his ſinne had deſerved: even himſelf had ſo judged againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, verſ. 5. and he might the rather fear it, becauſe of thoſe words, verſ. 10. <hi>Now therefore the ſword ſhall never depart from thine houſe; becauſe thou haſt deſpiſed me, and haſt taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Howbeit, becauſe by this deed, thou haſt given great occaſion to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God to blaſpheme,</hi> &amp;c.] Two ſeverall wayes had David <hi>given occaſion to the enemies of God to blaſpheme:</hi> to wit, firſt, becauſe by cauſing Uriah and others of the people of God to be ſlain by the Ammonites, he gave occaſion to them (who were the enemies of God in regard they were the enemies of Gods people) to inſult and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over them; and ſo at leaſt in effect to blaſpheme the Lord God of Iſrael, as not able to defend his people againſt them; as it is ſaid of the Aſſyrians when they oppreſſed grievouſly the people of God whom they carried away captives, Iſaiah 52.5. <hi>They that rule over them make them to houl, ſaith the Lord, and my name continually every day is blaſphemed:</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe by his groſſe ſinnes he had given occaſion to wicked prophane men (whom God eſteems his enemies) to ſpeak evil of that which God had done for David; yea and of all the godly that walked ſtrictly with God as David had done, and of all ſuch wayes of piety and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42229:201"/>
zeal as David had hitherto walked in. What? might they ſay, is this the man after Gods own heart, of whom Samuel promiſed ſuch great matters? Did Saul ever commit adultery with another mans wife as he hath done? and why then was Saul caſt off, and he anointed in his room? but thus indeed it is with all thoſe that make ſuch a ſhew of religion, and ſeem ſo zealous of religion, there are none ſo bad as they: this is the fruit of their hearing and praying ſo much, &amp;c. Thus wicked and prophane wretches were like to deſcant upon theſe ſinnes of David, and ſo to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme according to that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 2.24. where having ſpoke much of the great wickedneſſe of the Jews, he addes, <hi>For the name of God is blaſphemed amongſt the Gentiles through you;</hi> and for this cauſe the prophet tells David here, that the child he had begotten of the wife of Uriah ſhould die; <hi>Becauſe by this deed thou haſt given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme: the child alſo that is born unto thee, ſhall ſurely die.</hi> For though it were in ſome regard a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit both to David and Bathſheba that this child died, (ſo did God temper his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure with goodneſſe, for as long as this child had lived it would have been a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of their ſinne and ſhame both to themſelves and others) yet conſidering the affection they bare to their child, and the manifeſtation of Gods diſpleaſure therein; it was indeed a ſharp affliction, and cauſed David a great deal of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>David therefore beſought God for the child,</hi> &amp;c.] For though Nathan had told him that the child ſhould ſurely die, yet he might hope that this was threatned conditionally, and that upon his tears and repentance this ſentence might be reverſed; as was afterward that of Hezekiah his death, and the deſtruction of the Ninivites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And it came to paſſe on the ſeventh day, that the child died.]</hi> That is, the ſeventh day after he fell ſick, or (as many take it) the ſeventh day after he was born; and if we thus underſtand the words, then the child died, before he was circumciſed, and yet after he was dead, David cheared up himſelf we ſee, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the childs ſalvation, yea though he was begot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Then David aroſe from the earth, and waſhed and anointed himſelf, and changed his apparell, and came into the houſe of the Lord and worſhipped,</hi> &amp;c.] There is a law, Num. 10.14. That when one died in a tent, all that came into the tent and all that was in the tent, ſhould be unclean ſeven dayes, yet David preſently after the death of this infant, waſhed himſelf, and went up into the houſe of God: either therefore this law when they came to dwell in houſes, was underſtood to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no further then to the room where the party died, not to the whole houſe; or elſe, the child died not in the ſame houſe wherein David was, but in ſome other houſe not farre from Davids pallace. Many reaſons may be conceived, why David, his conſcience being now awakened, was ſo eager to worſhip God in his houſe; to wit, partly that he might bleſſe God for calling him to repentance, when he lay in ſuch a dangerous condition, for giving him aſſurance by the prophet that his ſinne was pardoned, and for enabling him to bear with patience the loſſe of his child; and partly that he might further acknowledge and bewail his ſinnes before God, and pray for mercy in regard of thoſe remaining corrections which God had threatned
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:42229:201"/>
him with, at leaſt that God would ſtrengthen him to bear them, and ſanctifie them to his good. However obſervable it is, that ſo eager he was upon theſe duties of Gods worſhip, that though he had faſted all the time the child lay ſick, yet he would not eat any thing till he had firſt been in the houſe of God, that is, the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle which he had ſet up for the ark; but when once he had been there and had there worſhipped the Lord, <hi>Then,</hi> as it follows in the next words, <hi>he came to his own houſe, and when he required they ſet bread before him, and he did eat.</hi>

Nathan it was that told him that his former child born of Bathſheba ſhould ſurely die; and by Nathan now the Lord aſſured him concerning this child that he ſhould be Jedidiah, that is, <hi>The beloved of the Lord,</hi> and herein alſo was Solomon a type of Chriſt, Matth. 3.17. <hi>And ſo a voice from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved ſonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought againſt it, and took it.]</hi> It may juſtly ſeem ſtrange, that David ſhould go with a numerous army, out of the land of Iſrael, into the land of the Ammonites, onely to take a citie that was in a manner taken already; and which they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid would be wonne before he came; and that for no other end, but that David might have the name of taking the citie. But for this we muſt conſider: firſt, that even the beſt of Gods ſervants are naturally vain-glorious, and too much tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a deſire of having their name famous and renowned; and ſecondly, there might be other occaſions of Davids going thither, as for the proſecuting of their conqueſts in the land of the Ammonites, and for giving directions for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe, that had with ſuch ſcorn abuſed his embaſſadours; and that Joab knowing this, did adviſe him onely, the rather to haſten his coming thither, that the citie might be taken by him; and ſo he might have the glory of this great piece of ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 30. <hi>And he took the kings crown from off his head; the weight whereof was a talent of gold, with the pretious stones,</hi> &amp;c.] There was but a talent of gold in the golden candleſtick of the Sanctuary, Exod, 25.39. which is thought to have been at leaſt an hundred and twenty pound weight; but the common talent, ſome ſay, was but half ſo much as the talent of the Sanctuary, to wit, ſixty pound weight; and ſo much it may be therefore this crown weighed: and if ſo, doubtleſſe it was too maſſie to be uſually worn. Rather it was a crown of ſtate, which was onely ſet upon the heads of their kings, at their coronation; or hung over their heads in ſome chair of ſtate, and ſo happely at this time it was ſet upon their kings head, and then taken off, and ſet upon Davids; to ſhew, that now the royall dignity was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from him to David: and indeed, becauſe the brother of this king, the ſonne of Nahuſh, ſuccoured David when he fled from Abſalom, chap. 17.27.28. it is moſt probable, that Hanun was now either depoſed, or put to death by David, and his brother made governour of Rabbah, whence it was that he ſhewed ſuch reſpect to David in that time of his troubles.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>I pray thee, ſpeak unto the king, for he will not with-hold me from thee.]</hi> When nothing elſe would prevail with him, being in a ſtreight, ſhe adviſeth him to deſire her of his father for his wife, not as thinking that this could be done; but onely as deſiring by any means to put him off for the preſent, from the proſecuting of this his wicked purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly,</hi> &amp;c.] Thoſe pangs of grief and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience, which men uſually feel after an act of uncleanneſſe committed, do naturally alienate the affections of men, from thoſe that have been the occaſions of their ſinne, and make them oft-times to loath them more then before they loved them: and ſo it ſeems it was with Amnon, but then beſides there was no doubt a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hand of God in this, whereby way was made to the publiſhing of this ſinne for the puniſhment of David.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Amnon ſaid unto her, Ariſe, be gone.]</hi> It is a wonder that Amnon ſhould thus put her forth, even becauſe of the reſpect he might have had to his own credit and ſafety; had he kept her a while with him, by many entreaties, and tendring what ſatisfaction could be made her, he might have perſwaded her to conceal what he had done, whereas her blubber'd eyes, and ſuch other ſignes of the force done to her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently thruſt out of doors, muſt needs make that wickedneſſe which had been ſecretly done, either vehemently ſuſpected, or manifeſtly known, and ſo expoſe him to the wrath of his father, the puniſhment of the law, (which in caſe of a rape was death) and ſhame amongſt all that ſhould heare of it: but God infatuated him, and why? he meant by this inceſt of Amnon, and Abſaloms murthering his brother in revenge of this rape, to puniſh David for his adultery with Bathſheba, and murther of Uriah, and therefore by occaſion of this mad rage of Amnon, it muſt be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and known.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>This evil in ſending me away, is greater then the other that thou didſt

unto me.]</hi> To wit, becauſe this turning her our in ſuch a condition, would expoſe her to ſo much ſhame and reproch, and not onely diſcover that ſhe had been defiled, but perhaps alſo raiſe an opinion in ſome, that ſhe had conſented, and thereupon was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and caſt off by Amnon, as ſtrumpets uſe to be by thoſe whom they have invei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to commit folly with them; and withall becauſe hereby the name of God would be blaſphemed amongſt his enemies, when they ſhould heare of ſuch a fact commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt his people, the people of God would be ſcandalized, and the heart of their father deeply and ſorely wounded. It is true indeed, that if by <hi>evil</hi> here, onely ſinne be meant, ſhe might well ſay in that ſenſe in ſome regard, that the evil in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her away, was greater then that of defiling her: to wit, in regard this was an act ſo full of inhumanity and cruelty, and for which there could not be pleaded ſuch an over-bearing temptation as there was in the other: but yet there is little queſtion I think to be made, that by <hi>evil</hi> here is meant the evil of injury, or miſchief done to her, and ſo it is no wonder that ſhe ſhould ſay, that the evil in ſending her away, was greater then that of his defiling her: for however the raviſhing her was an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wrong, yet conſidering how grievous the ſhame neceſſarily following the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery hereof, would be to her, ſhe might well judge this, in her paſſion eſpecially, farre worſe then the former evil.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And ſhe had a garment of divers colours upon her,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wrought, or embroidered work; and that which is added, that with ſuch robes were the kings daughters, that were virgins apparelled, is to ſhew, that the rending of her virgin attire, verſ. 19. <hi>And Tamar put aſhes on her head and rent her garment of divers coulours:</hi> did as it were ſecretly diſcover, that her virginity had been by force rent from her.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>He is thy brother, regard not this thing.]</hi> It ſeems when Tamar was turned out of doors ſhe went not to her father, as being happely moſt aſhamed to ſee him, and ſenſible what an exceeding grief it would be to him, but to her brother Abſalom, who was near and dearer to her then the reſt of her brethren, becauſe he was her brother both by father and mother, who thereupon did what he could to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie her: <hi>Hold now thy peace,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my ſiſter; he is thy brother, regard not this thing,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, his ſhame will be the ſhame of us all, and therefore be ſilent: and thus he endeavoured to ſay ſomething to appeaſe her ſorrow for the preſent, though himſelf were even at the ſame time highly enraged at what his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done, and fully reſolved to be revenged on him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>But when king David heard of all theſe things, he was very wroth.]</hi> This is noted, as an inexcuſable weakneſſe in David: when he heard how Amnon had raviſhed his ſiſter, and conſidered that he had made uſe of him to get his ſiſter into his hands, that he might defile her, he was highly enraged at it, but for all this his anger, he let him paſſe unpuniſhed; for what a poore puniſhment was the cheeks or frowns of a father, for ſuch a foul abomination?</p>

Had he quarrelled with Ammon, or ſhown himſelf diſcontented, this would have made Amnon the more jealous and wary of him; whereas now by carrying the matter ſo ſmoothly as he did, Amnon feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſo fell eaſily into the ſnare he had laid.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And it came to paſſe after two full years, that Abſalom had ſheepſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> &amp;c.] When Abſalom, after two years waiting, ſaw well there would be no courſe taken againſt Amnon, by David their father (the Lord having in this given him up to the inordinate love of his children, that Abſalom provoked hereby, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid might be now puniſhed with the ſword alſo) and hoped, that now they might think that Abſalom had forgotten that which Amnon had done to his ſiſter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take this occaſion of his ſheep-ſhearing feaſt, to invite his brother home to his houſe, intending there to kill Amnon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Behold now thy ſervant hath ſheep-ſhearers: Let the king I beſeech thee, and his ſervants, go with thy ſervants.]</hi> Doubtleſſe the chief reaſon why Abſalom invited all his brothers to his ſheep-ſhearing feaſt, yea and his father too, was, that Amnon might not ſuſpect any thing; yet it may well be alſo (as ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours have noted) that he deſired his father ſhould have been an eye witneſſe of the tragicall execution of his inceſtuous darling, becauſe he had all this while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to puniſh him: and yet at this time was David ſo tender over this his ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſonne, that he would not go with his ſervants to his feaſt, onely leſt they ſhould be too chargeable to him, as it is expreſſed in the following words, <hi>Nay my ſonne,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>But Abſalom preſſed him, that he let Amnon, and all the kings ſonnes go with him.]</hi> It vvas ſtrange, that neither Amnon nor David ſhould ſuſpect any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvhen Abſalom vvas ſo earneſt to have Amnon come to his houſe, that he would not take a deniall of his father, but preſſed him till at laſt he conſented to it: but when the Lord means to correct his children, or to puniſh wicked men, he is wont thus to take away their wiſdome and underſtanding from them, ſo that they ſhall not ſee the danger approching, though never ſo evident, but ſhall go on, as blind men into a trap; when any body that had their eyes in their heads, might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern it.</p>

But it ſeems Davids heart did encline to the ſaving of his own ſonne Abſalom, who was guiltie of the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and by this byas was his heart drawn aſide, to ſpare unjuſtly this widdows ſonne too.</p>

But rather I conceive it is meant of the inevitable lot of all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men, to wit, that they muſt need, die and that being dead they cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, no more then water can be gathered up that is ſpilt upon the earth; for this is the plain ſenſe of the words, and is pertinent to make good that which ſhe had ſaid, that the continuing of Abſaloms baniſhment would leave Gods people in as

Some Expoſitours do otherwiſe underſtand this which is ſaid, that the Lord <hi>doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe means, that his baniſhed be not expelled from him:</hi> for ſome conceive it is meant of his favour, in receiving repenting ſinners, that though without reſpect of any mans perſon, he hath caſt off all mankind for ſinne, yet he hath deviſed a means, that ſuch as will repent, ſubmit, and believe in Chriſt, ſhould be received into his favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and thus they conceive, that this woman did covertly put David in mind of Gods pardoning his adulterie with Bathſheba, and murder of Uriah, as a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to move him to ſhew mercy unto Abſalom. Others underſtand it of Gods providence in regard of Abſalom, to wit, that though he had chaſtiſed him by this baniſhment he had ſuffered, yet he had hitherto kept him alive, and had now mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the people to ſet this woman a work to ſolicite David for him, and ſo had deviſed <hi>a means that his baniſhed,</hi> that is, Abſalom ſhould not be for ever expelled from him; but the firſt expoſition I conceive is moſt proper.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Now therefore that I am come to ſpeak of this thing unto my Lord the king, it is becauſe the people have made me afraid.]</hi> That is, becauſe their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent made me fear what the event of this would prove; or, becauſe I was afraid for the peoples ſake, to wit, firſt, leſt he ſhould make an invaſion upon the land, being aided therein by his father-in-law, the king of Geſhur, to whom he is fled: or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, leſt the people ſhould riſe up in ſome uproar, becauſe of him, and ſend for him home without thy conſent, and perhaps proceed further to ſome more mutinous and miſcheivous courſes: or thirdly, leſt the people ſhould hereafter be corrupted in point of Religion, by means of him, who hath lived ſo long amongſt idolatrous heathens.</p>

ſhould have ſaid, I reaſoned thus with my ſelf, ſurely the king will heare me his poore handmaid in this caſe of my ſonne; and if ſo, his anſwer will be comfortable alſo, when I come to propound the caſe of his own; now this confidence of hers, that the king would grant her requeſt, ſhe alledges here, not onely to ſhew what it was that did embolden her to come to the king with this requeſt, but alſo as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument whereby to move him to ſatisfie her deſire; for all men are naturally loth to deny thoſe that come to them with full aſſurance, that what they crave ſhall be done for them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>For as an Angel of God, ſo is my Lord the king, to diſcern good and bad.]</hi> That is, thou art exceeding wiſe to diſcern between good and evil in any thing that is propounded to thee: ſome Expoſitours hold that ſhe ſaid, David was <hi>as an Angel of God to diſcern good and bad,</hi> becauſe he was a Prophet, and inſpired by God, to judge of any thing propounded to him. But I rather joyn with them that ſay it was proverbiall phraſe uſed in thoſe times, to expreſſe a mans excellency in any thing, by comparing him to an Angel of God: for thus Achiſh ſaid to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, 1. <hi>Sam</hi> 27.9. <hi>thou art good in my ſight, as an Angel of God:</hi> and Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth to David, chap. 19.27. <hi>My Lord the king is as an Angel of God:</hi> however, the aim of the woman of Tekoah in extolling David thus, was partly to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſhe was ſo confident that he would rightly judge in this cauſe, and partly to curry favour with him, that hereby he might be the better wonne to grant her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and therefore we ſee in what an exceſſive ſtrain ſhe extolls his wiſdome (as flatterers are wont to do, when they extoll Princes) verſ. 20. <hi>My Lord is wiſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wiſdome of an Angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</hi>

                     <hi>Therefore the Lord thy God will be with thee.]</hi> Becauſe thou judgeſt rightly (and no doubt wilt ſo do in this which I have adventured to commend to thee) the Lord will be with thee to bleſſe thee in all thy enterprizes, proſpering thy government, and making thy kingdome to flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himſelf, and thanked the king,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Joab knew well that David deſired Abſaloms return more then he (for this it was which put him at firſt upon this plot, as is expreſſed before verſ. 1.) yet becauſe David would ſeem to do it merely upon his requeſt, and he knew it would endear him to David, that he ſhould deſire and rejoyce at the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his children, therefore he alſo carried himſelf, as if he thought that David had done it for his ſake, profeſſing that he accepted it with much thankfulneſſe, and as a clear argument of the kings favour to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the king ſaid, Let him turn to his own houſe, and let him not ſee my face.]</hi> This David enjoyned: firſt, to humble Abſalom the more for his ſinne, and that too that the recovery of his fathers favour, might not embolden him to do evil again: and ſecondly, out of a reſpect to his own credit amongſt the people, that he might not ſeem too facil, to one that was guilty of ſo foul a fact, but that rather it might be thought he was in a manner conſtrained to fetch him home: and thirdly, to deterre others from doing the like.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>But in all Iſrael there was none to be ſo much praiſed as Abſalom, for his beauty</hi> &amp;c.] This mention of Abſaloms rare beauty, is here inſerted to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate one reaſon of Davids ſtrong affection to him, and to ſhew how hard it was to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:42229:207"/>
hide himſelf from him, or it is prefixed before the ſtory of his rebellion: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was one main thing that made him ſo proud and high minded: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe this was one thing that did much winne the hearts of the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>Therefore Abſalom ſent for Joab, to have ſent him to the king,</hi> &amp;c.] This being thus prefixed before the ſtory of Abſaloms rebellion, it makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the diſcontent he took at this, did firſt ſtirre in him that purpoſe of riſing againſt his father, and knowing not well how to accompliſh this as long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued baniſhed from the court, this might make him ſo violently earneſt to be brought again into the kings favour.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>Wherefore am I come from Geſhur? it had been good for me to have been there ſtill.]</hi> Firſt, becauſe his fathers diſpleaſure was farre the more grievous the nearer he was to him: ſecondly, becauſe the infamy of not being ſuffered to ſee his father, would not have been ſo notorious and remarkable had he continued in Geſhur, as it was now that he was come home to Jeruſalem: and thirdly, becauſe in Geſhur he injoyed his libertie, whereas now he was cooped up in his houſe, and might not come to the court, therefore he profeſſeth that he had rather have ſtayed in Geſhur ſtill, then live in that manner as he did. It ſeems he minded not much the libertie of Gods ordinances, which he was wholly deprived of in Geſhur, and now might enjoy again being returned to Jeruſalem. No, what cared he for Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? becauſe he might not come to the court, Jeruſalem was to him no better then Geſhur.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now therefore let me ſee the kings face, and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.]</hi> That is, if he will not ſuffer me to ſee his face, as being one that have deſerved to die, let him put me to death: for I had rather die then live thus: but whence was this confidence of Abſalom? perhaps out of an opinion that he did well in revenging the rape of his ſiſter, but eſpecially from a ſecret perſwaſion he had of his fathers gentleneſſe and indulgence towards him, by reaſon whereof he knew he would not put him to death.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>So Joab came to the king and told him, and when he had called for Abſalom, he came to the king,</hi> &amp;c.] As ſoon as David heard that Abſalom took it ſo heavily, that he was debarred from his fathers preſence, and that he choſe rather to die then not to ſee his face, he concluded, that now he was throughly humbled, and that this proceeded from tender affection to his father (when indeed there was no ſuch matter, but he deſired onely to be at the court, that he might ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt the people, and advance himſelf to his fathers throne) and ſo thereupon he ſent for him, kiſſed him, and was fully reconciled to him.</p>

thoſe times, and as the firſt courſe he took, both to make known to the people that he expected to ſucceed his father in the throne (for in the great ſtate he took upon him, they might ſee what his hopes were) and alſo to gain upon the affection of the people; for outward pomp, and ſhews, and magnificence, are wont mightily to work upon the common people, who by the outward bravery of men are ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to conclude, that they are men of brave and gallant ſpirits: David we muſt know began now to be aged; Abſalom therefore remembring how his father had ſhewed his diſpleaſure againſt him for killing his brother Amnon, and fearing leaſt for that fact of his, he ſhould be judged unworthy to ſucceed him; yea, and hearing perhaps ſome rumours to that purpoſe ſcattered abroad concerning Solomon, through he were Davids eldeſt ſonne, yet he thought it not ſafe to abide his fathers death, but reſolved to ſee if he could make himſelf king, his father being yet living; and to that end, firſt he ſought ſecretly to winne unto himſelf a popular reputation, and ſo to ſteal away the hearts of the people from his father, and then brake forth into an open inſurrection againſt him: and thus the Lord did not onely correct David for his ſinnes in the matter of Uriah, according to that which the Lord had ſaid to him by the prophet Nathan, <hi>Behold I will raiſe up evil againſt thee out of thine own houſe.</hi> chap. 12.11. but alſo, for his fond indulgence towards this his ungratious ſonne: when he had killed his brother, he was pardoned and was not cut off ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods law, and now did he lay a plot againſt his father, that had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>See, thy matters are good and right: but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.]</hi> Or as it is in the margent of our bibles, <hi>none will hear you from the king downwards.</hi> And indeed however the words are read, the meaning of theſe words of Abſalom was, not that the king had deputed no ſubordinate Judges or Magiſtrates, to hear the cauſes of thoſe that reſorted thither for juſtice, (for who can think that David had no judges under him to relieve thoſe that came to complain) but that none that were deputed to that office, would hear them uprightly and do them juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And on this manner did Abſalom to all Iſrael, that came to the king for judgement,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thus he flattered them all as is before related, verſ. 3. whether their cauſe were good or bad, it was all one to him, his anſwer was ſtill the ſame, <hi>See, thy matters are good and right: but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee:</hi> and thus he would embrace and kiſſe them all as is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, he made no difference between rich and poor, but would kiſſe and embrace the pooreſt man that came thither as ſoon as the greateſt; and this is noted firſt, to ſhew his deſperate wickedneſſe, in ſeeking ſo generally to ſpread the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of his fathers government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by pretending that there were none deputed of the king that would hearken to the juſt complaints of his ſubjec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this in the eares of ſome few, the wrong had been great, but to ſpread it abroad ſo generally, made his villany the greater: ſecondly, to ſhew and ſet forth how baſely this proud wretch could ſtoop, that he might accompliſh his ambitious deſignes: and thirdly, to intimate by what means the people were ſo generally afterwards, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to favour his conſpiracie, to wit, by this his ſcrewing himſelf generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the affections of the people, that came to the king for juſtice (for by this means, as it follows in the next words, <hi>Abſalom ſtole the hearts of the men of Iſrael:</hi>) and it is ſaid, that he ſtole away their hearts, firſt, becauſe he wonne them to a deſire that the crown might be transferred from David to him: their affections might have been to him as their Prince, without any wrong to David; but to draw off thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the people from David, which they did owe him as their ſovereigne the Lords anointed, and to winne them ſo to himſelf, that they ſhould wiſh that he were their king, this was manifeſt theft; becauſe thus their hearts ſhould have been ſet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon David: and ſecondly, becauſe he did this ſo ſecretly, cloſely, and cunningly, that David diſcerned it not, nor did the people at firſt diſcover his aim; he did not openly perſwade them to revolt from his father, but by courting the people, and ſeeming to bewail their condition, that they had not ſuch a refuge in the ſeat of juſtice as they ſhould have, he did covertly and ſlily draw off by degrees the hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the people, from the king to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And it came paſſe after fourty years, that Abſalom ſaid unto the king, I pray thee, let me go, and pay my vows,</hi> &amp;c.] Had he gone away with ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the people after him, as he had drawn into his conſpiracie, and not acquainted his father beforehand with it, this might have been ſuſpected: under pretence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a vow which he had made in Geſhur, to wit, that he would offer to God certain peace-offerings, gratulatory ſacrifices, if God ſhould be pleaſed to open a way for his return from that idolatrous place, to live again amongſt the people of God, and in his fathers favour, he begged leave of his father, that he might go and pay this his vow at Hebron, the place where he was born, and where his father was firſt crowned and anointed king, and where was one of the chief high places in the tribe of Judah, whether in thoſe time they reſorted to offer ſacrifices; and this he did, firſt, becauſe this ſhew of devotion he knew would pleaſe his father, and eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him liberty to go: and ſecondly, becauſe when they offered theſe peace-offerings, they uſed to make great feaſts therewith, and ſo under that colour he might invite thither his friends and followers, and many of the people, whom he might hope to winne to joyn with the reſt, in his intended conſpiracie: the greateſt difficulty of this place is, whence we muſt count theſe fourty years, after which it is ſaid here, that Abſalom got leave to go to Hebron, intending there to make himſelf king: that which would moſt readily come into any mans mind at the reading of theſe word is, that theſe fourty years muſt be counted from the beginning of Davids reigne, and then becauſe David reigned in all but fourty years, chap. 5.4. the meaning of the words muſt needs be this: <hi>And it came to paſſe after fourty years,</hi> that is, in the fourtieth yeare, to wit, the laſt year of Davids reigne, <hi>that Abſalom ſaid unto the king, I pray thee let me go, and pay my vow,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed ſome of our beſt Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours judge this account the moſt probable; partly, becauſe there can, they ſay, no juſt reaſon be given, why we ſhould count theſe fourty years from any other
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42229:208"/>
time, but the beginning of Davids reigne; and partly, becauſe in the laſt yeare of Davids reigne we may the better conceive why Abſalom ſhould break forth into theſe open and violent practiſes againſt his father, and ſhould find ſo many ſo ready to aſſiſt him herein, namely, becauſe his father began then to be very aged, and there could not but be ſome diſcovery by that time of Davids purpoſe to eſtabliſh Solomon in the throne; but yet becauſe it is very hard to conceive how all that which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards related concerning Davids reigne, could poſſibly be done in one yeare, and particularly, how there could be within the compaſſe of one yeare, ſo great a change in David, that he ſhould in the time of Abſaloms rebellion, be able to fly on foot out of Jeruſalem, as it is ſaid he did, verſ. 14. yea and that barefoot too, verſ. 30. and yet afterwards before the yeare was ended, lie bedrid with age, ſo extremely cold, that though they covered him with clothes, yet he could get no heat, as it is ſaid he was before he died, 1. Kings 1.1. therefore indeed the moſt of Expoſitours do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe compute theſe fourty years, as that it is meant of Abſaloms age, or of the fourty years from the anointing of Saul, or of the fourty years of the current Jubilee, &amp;c. of which all that I can ſay is this; namely, that there are onely two of theſe wayes of accounting theſe fourty years, that have any great ſhew of probability in them: firſt, that of thoſe that account from Davids firſt anointing, 1. Sam. 16.13. and ſecondly, that of reckoning them from the firſt ſetting up a king amongſt them, which was when Saul was anointed, and indeed upon ſuch a remarkable change in the government of the commonwealth of Iſrael as that was, it may well be that they uſed ſtill to reckon the years from that obſervable change, as they have done in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other kingdomes upon the like occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>But Abſalom ſent spies throughout all the tribes of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, that at the ſame time when he had plotted his journey to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, when he intended amongſt his conſpiratours to be anointed king, he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo certain men as ſpies to go ſeverally into all the tribes of Iſrael, who were to ſearch and to ſift the hearts of the people in all places, and to prepare and fit them for this change; and at the ſet time agreed upon between them, to wit, when he was to be anointed king at Hebron, upon the ſound of trumpets they were to ſay, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom reigneth in Hebron: As ſoon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as ye hear the ſound of the trumpet, then ye ſhall ſay, Abſalom reigneth in Hebron:</hi> whereby is meant, either that upon the ſounding of the trumpets in every tribe, theſe ſpies ſhould make known the reaſon of it to the people; namely, that it was becauſe Abſalom was made king in Hebron in ſtead of his father, that ſo then the people mighty cry out, as is uſuall at ſuch times, God ſave king Abſalom; or rather, that when the people were ſummoned by the ſound of the trumpet to come to Hebron, then theſe ſpies ſhould make known the cauſe, why they were called together, to wit, becauſe Abſalom in Hebron was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crowned king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And with Abſalom went two hundred men out of Jer;uſalem, that were called and they went in their ſimplicitie,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, being invited to the feaſt of Abſaloms peace-offerings, they went in the ſimplicitie of their hearts, merely as invited gueſts not knowing any thing of the plotted conſpiracy: but why would Abſalom invite ſuch of whom he could have no aſſurance whether they would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his deſignes or no? I anſwer, that ſeverall reaſons might induce him hereto, to

wit, firſt, becauſe he knew that the people generally favoured him, and therefore hoped that when they came thither and ſaw what was done, they would ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, and joyn in the conſpiracy: ſecondly, becauſe however, if they proved firm to his father, then his fathers party would be weakned by drawing ſo many out of the citie, that would there have taken his part againſt Abſalom: and thirdly, becauſe by inviting ſuch known faithfull men, that meant no ill, his plot intended would be the better concealed.</p>

                  <p>Verſ 18. <hi>And all his ſervants paſſed on beſides him, and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites.]</hi> Concerning theſe Cherethites and Pelethites, ſee the note. chap. 8.18. the Gittites doubtleſſe were the garriſon ſouldiers that kept Gath, which David had taken not long before from the Philiſtines, chap. 8.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Then ſaid the king unto Ittai the Gittite, wherefore goest thou alſo with us?</hi> &amp;c.] This Ittai was one of Davids principall Captains, to whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the third part of his army when they went out againſt Abſalom, chap. 18.2. and had fled (as it ſeems) from the Philiſtines or ſome other of the neighbouring nations (for why elſe is he called <hi>a ſtranger and an exile,</hi>) and ſo living with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was become a Proſelite, and was at preſent the Captain of the Gittites. Now firſt, becauſe he was <hi>a ſtranger and an exile,</hi> and therefore too, not like to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or hurt by the new king or his followers, he thought it unequall to engage him in their diſſentions; to make him that had loſt all in his own land by ſiding in their combuſtions, to be as unſafe in Iſrael whither he had fled for ſanctuary, as he had been before in his own countrey, he judged a very unreaſonable thing: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe he was upon ſome occaſion very lately come from Gath with his ſouldiers, he judged it too much to make them preſently march up and down with him, before they had well reſted themſelves, and therefore he diſſwades them from going with him, though he had all the reaſon in the world to ſtrengthen his party as much as he poſſibly could; yet thinking it not fitting to take them along with him for the reaſons here alledged, and being confident in Gods aſſiſtance, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Pſal. 3.6. he was not ſo eager upon any outward helps for the ſtrengthening of himſelf, as to do any thing that had but a ſhow of unwarrantableneſſe in it, and therefore he earneſtly perſwadeth him to return with his men and to abide with the new proclaimed king, that is Abſalom, <hi>Return,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to thy place, and abide with the king,</hi> &amp;c. hoping alſo perhaps in their troubles to make the ſame uſe of him that he did afterwards of Huſhai. verſ. 34. <hi>If thou return to the city, and ſay unto Abſalom, I will be thy ſervant, O king: as I have been thy fathers ſervant hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſo will I now alſo be thy ſervant; then mayest thou for me defeat the counſel of Ahithophel.</hi>

miniſtery as we may ſee, 1. Chron. 9.22. <hi>All theſe which were choſen to be por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the gates were two hundred and twelve.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And they ſet down the ark of God,</hi> &amp;c.) That is, when they came to the place where David and his company reſolved to ſtay a while, waiting and obſerving how things would paſſe, there they ſet down the ark; but as for Abiathar who was now the high prieſt, and went alſo out of Jeruſalem together with David, it is here ſaid that he <hi>went up untill all the people had done paſſing out of the city:</hi> either becauſe he went in the forefront of the people that came along with David, and ſo ſtayed not, but led them up mount Olivet untill all the company that followed him were paſſed over the brook Kidron and were come to the place where the ark was ſet down: or elſe, becauſe he went up to that part of mount Olivet where the ark was ſet down, and there ſtayed till all the people were come thither that followed David out of the citie; and being happely in a high place, he might thence ſee the people coming, and when they left coming out of the citie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And the king ſaid unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the citie,</hi> &amp;c.] Though David knew that the ark was a viſible teſtimonie of Gods preſence, and could have been glad to enjoy it; yet partly, becauſe he deſired to make uſe of the prieſts who attended the ark, and without whom he might not keep the ark, to give him intelligence out of the city of all the counſels and practiſes of Abſalom againſt him, verſ. 35.36. <hi>And haſt thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the prieſts, therefore it ſhall be that what thing ſoever thou ſhalt hear out of the kings houſe, thou ſhalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the prieſts. Behold they have there with them their two ſonnes, and by them ye ſhall ſend unto me every thing that ye can hear:</hi> and partly perhaps, becauſe he was loth to bring them in danger, remembring what the prieſts had formerly ſuffered at Nob for his ſake, he was contented for the preſent to want the preſence of the ark, as having his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and not relying altogether upon the externall ſacrament, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them to carry it back again into Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>The king ſaid alſo unto Zadok the prieſt, Art not thou a ſeer?</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive that Zadok is here called <hi>a ſeer,</hi> onely becauſe he was now in the courſe of his attendance upon the ark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is noted above, verſ. 24. and was to enquire of the Lord for the people upon all occaſions, and to return them Gods anſwer; which cannot be, becauſe he was not the high prieſt, who onely might wear the Ephod; but others conceive that he was alſo a prophet, and had that extraordinary gift of foretelling things to come, for ſuch were called <hi>Seers,</hi> 1. Sam. 9.9. or that he was a man expert in the oracles of God, and conſequently, that the drift of Davids men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning this, may be either to imply that in this regard, he was the better able to judge whether the advice he gave were not right and fit to be followed; or elſe, to ſhew the cauſe why it was fit he ſhould return (to wit, becauſe he was in this his courſe the publick miniſter appointed to attend the ark for the ſervice of the whole Church, and withall, might there conſult with God in his behalf, and give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing that concerned him, as occaſion ſerved: <hi>Return</hi> ſaith he, <hi>into the city in peace, and your two ſonnes with you;</hi> but yet that their two ſonnes Ahimaaz

and Jonathan went not with their fathers into Jeruſalem, is evident, chap. 17.17. <hi>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz ſtayed by En-rogel, for they might not be ſeen to come into the citie:</hi> and therefore it ſeems their fathers appointed them to ſtay at En-rogel.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And David went up by the aſcent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered,</hi> &amp;c.] His weeping was no doubt eſpecially becauſe he was afflicted with the remembrance of his ſinne, that had brought theſe troubles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and his covering his head was ſuitable hereto; for ſo was the cuſtome of mourners, to wit, partly that their tears might not be ſeen, and partly that the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other objects, might not divert their minds from intending their ſorrows, as being deſirous to give up themſelves wholly to bewail their mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ 32. <hi>When David was come to the top of the mount, where he worſhipped God, behold Huſhai the Archite came to meet him,</hi> &amp;c.] He worſhipped the Lord on the top of the mount, becauſe thence he might beſt behold the ark the teſtimony of Gods preſente, as the prieſts were carrying it back to Jeruſalem, and be thereby ſtirred up the more affectionately, and effectually to call upon the Lord, and becauſe being gone over that mount, he was like for a time to ſee it no more; but that which is moſt obſervable is, that no ſooner had David prayed againſt the counſels of Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thophel, <hi>O Lord, I pray thee, turn the counſel of Ahithophel into fooliſhneſſe</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently there came to him Huſhai (who is called the <hi>Archite,</hi> from the place of his birth or habitation, to wit, Archi, a place mentioned Joſh. 16.2. which was in the borders of the children of Joſeph) by whom God had determined to defeat his counſels.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>Unto whom David ſaid, If thou paſſeſt on with me, then thou ſhalt be a burden unto me.]</hi> Whereas by going back to Jeruſalem, he might there do him better ſervice, and withall be no way burdenſome to him, and indeed though Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid had cauſe enough to be glad to ſee his party encreaſe, yet no wonder it is, that he ſhould tell Huſhai, that ſtaying with him he would be a burden to him: firſt, becauſe he and his attendants that came with him, would help to expend their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which was yet but ſmall: and ſecondly, becauſe his care for thoſe that went with him, and his grief for the miſery they were like to ſuſtain was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>Say unto Abſalom, I will be thy ſervant, O king,</hi> &amp;c.] Herein David teacheth Huſhai to diſſemble with Abſalom, and an eaſie thing it is for the beſt men in their extremities, to pitch upon ſuch counſels as are not exactly ſuch as they ought to be.</p>

that ſhewed him favour in this time of his affliction, would be well rewarded for it, and this made him come now with theſe preſents to David. And thus many ſide with Chriſt, and that too in the time of perſecution and trouble, that yet have falſe hearts, and aim merely at their own advantage; though his Church be for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the weakeſt, yet they hope it will prove the ſtrongeſt, and upon that ground they ſide with them; they follow Chriſt for his loaves, and fiſhes, Joh. 6.26.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Then ſaid the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth.]</hi> It is very ſtrange that David, ſo juſt and good a king, ſhould now when the hand of God was upon him, pronounce ſuch an unjuſt ſentence as this was, againſt a poore cripple, that was not very likely to affect the crown, as Ziba had ſlandered him, nor very well able to come and plead for himſelf; yea againſt the ſonne of his dear friend Jonathan, who had alwayes been ſo loving to him, and with whom he had made a ſolemn covenant, that he would ſhew kindneſſe both to him, and to his ſeed after him, 1. Sam. 20.14.17. but for this we muſt conſider: firſt, that there were many probabilities to induce David to believe that falſe tale that Ziba had told him; as becauſe Mephiboſheth came not out to David, as other his friends did, and becauſe for all his lameneſſe, Mephiboſheth the true heir of Saul, might in theſe troublous times, hope that Sauls family might be remembred, and ſo might prove treacherous, as many others did: and ſecondly, that David did this in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being mightily enraged to heare, that Mephiboſheth ſhould ſo requite all the kindneſſe he had ſhewn him: and thirdly, doubtleſſe God was pleaſed herein to leave David to himſelf, that ſo he might ſee by this groſſe failing, that it was not for any merits in him, but of Gods own free grace, that his enemies were afterwards ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and he again ſettled in the throne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Ziba ſaid, I humbly beſeech thee that I may find grace in thy ſight, my Lord, O king.]</hi> That is, I acknowledge thankfully the bounty of my Lord, yet I eſteem thy favour more then the gift which thou haſt given me; I came not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Mephiboſheth, that ſo I might wreſt his eſtate from him, but I came to procure thy favour, O king, and that it is which I chiefly deſire may be continued to me.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And when king David came to Bahurim.]</hi> See the note, chap. 3.16.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>The Lord hath returned upon thee all the bloud of the houſe of Saul,</hi> &amp;c.] Shimei might in theſe words have reſpect to the death of Iſhboſheth and Abner, as pretending that David had ſecretly a hand therein: yea, and perhaps too it was before this, that thoſe ſeven ſonnes of Saul were delivered up to the Gibeonites to be hanged by them, though the ſtory of that be related after this, chap. 21. but beſides all this, it is very probable, which ſome ſay, that the enemies of David did
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42229:211"/>
charge him, that he had ſtirred up the Philiſtines to make that invaſion upon the land wherein Saul and his ſonnes were ſlain, and therefore Shimei here chargeth <hi>all the bloud of the houſe of Saul</hi> upon David.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the king ſaid, What have I to do with you, ye ſonnes of Zeruiah?]</hi> As if he had ſaid, trouble me not, I will in this take none of your counſell, nor will I have a hand in your wayes of revenge.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>It may be, that the Lord will look on mine affliction, and that the Lord will requite good for his curſing this day.]</hi> This hope of Davids was grounded doubtleſſe upon the Lords uſuall dealing with his children; for as Phyſicians are wont to give cordialls after purges, to ſupport and cheriſh the ſpirits of their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; ſo when the Lord ſuffers wicked men to abuſe his ſervants, he is wont uſually as pitying them for their ſorrows, to recompence the evil they have done them, even here in this world, with ſome ſpeciall mercy.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 13. <hi>And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hills ſide over againſt him, and curſed as he went,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added; firſt, to ſhew the violence of Shimie's malice: ſecondly, the conſtancy of Davids patience; and thirdly, the obedience of Davids captains, who now were quiet, though Shimei ſtill ceaſed not to revile their Lord, and would not give over.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreſhed themſelves there.]</hi> That is, at Bahurim, verſ. 5.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Abſalom ſaid to Huſhai, Is this thy kindneſſe to thy friend?</hi> &amp;c.] This he ſaith to ſift and try Huſhai, as wondring at, and ſuſpecting his revolt from David, not as diſliking any ſuch ingratitude; for why then ſhould he not as well condemn himſelf for riſing up againſt his father that begat him, and that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been ſo loving, yea indulgent towards him; and indeed in his ſpeaking of this to Huſhai, one may ſee that his conſcience did inwardly accuſe him for doing as bad himſelf, as that he ſeemed to charge Huſhai with, and therefore he ſaid not, is this thy kindneſſe to my father thy friend? and why wenteſt thou not with my father? but <hi>is this thy kindneſſe to thy friend?</hi> and <hi>Why wenteſt thou not with thy friend?</hi> as being aſhamed to mention the name of father, or to utter a word that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him of ſo foul a ſinne.</p>

what would become of him and the reſt of Abſaloms abettours: yea, if the people did but fear this, it might keep them from ſiding with Abſalom; to prevent theſe miſchiefs, therefore he ſeeks to engage Abſalom in this (as he judged) unpardonable villany.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>So they ſpread Abſalom a tent upon the top of the houſe, and Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom went in unto his fathers concubines,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus was that accompliſhed which God had threatned, chap. 12.11. of which ſee the note there: he that ſlew Amnon becauſe he had committed inceſt with his ſiſter Tamar, did now himſelf commit the ſame ſinne with his fathers concubines; and this he did too, not drawn thereto with the ſtrength of his luſts, but adviſedly upon politick reſpects, led there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the counſel of Ahithophel, which doubtleſſe was a great aggravation of his ſin.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And the counſell of Ahithophel, which he counſelled in thoſe dayes, was as if a man had enquired at the Oracle of God.]</hi> That is, it was highly prized, and for the ſucceſſe counted moſt ſure and certain.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Behold, he is hid now in ſome pit, or in ſome other place,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe words may be underſtood either with relation to that which went before ſhewing more fully how unlikely it was, that they ſhould ceaſe upon David, though they ſhould preſently purſue him, to wit, becauſe he would not at that time lodge in the camp with his ſouldiers, but in ſome pit or cave, well known to him ſince in thoſe places he uſed to hide himſelf from Saul &amp; ſo would eſcape, though any diſtaſter ſhould happen to his followers; or elſe with relation to that which followeth, knowing that David, as an experienced ſouldier, was like enough to lie in ambuſh with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in ſome cave, or ſuch ſecret place, whence, ſaith he, ſuddenly ruſhing out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy men that purſue them, it is like they will put them to the worſt, at leaſt at firſt, and then, ſaith he, <hi>it wil come to paſſe, when ſome of them be overthrown,</hi> that is, ſome of thoſe twelve thouſand which Ahithophel intends to lead forth againſt thy father, the report will be, that thy ſouldiers are ſlaughtered, <hi>whoſoever heareth will ſay, There is a ſlaughter among the people that follow Abſalom,</hi> and ſo the ſtouteſt of thy followers will be quelled, <hi>he whoſe heart is as the heart of a lion, ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly melt:</hi> all will be appalled, and the buſineſſe we have in hand, utterly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably ruined.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>For all Iſrael knoweth, that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.]</hi> This is added to prove what Huſhai had ſaid to Abſalom, to wit, that upon the killing of ſome of his men at the firſt aſſault, there would be a report raiſed of a great ſlaughter amongſt his men, and ſo all would be quelled and put to flight; how likely this was to be, he ſhews by this reaſon, taken from the great opinion which all the people had, of the exceeding valour of David and his men; namely, becauſe this would make men the more inclinable, both to believe and to ſpread abroad ſuch a report, and it would make the report alſo the more terrible to all that heard it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Therefore I counſel, that all Iſrael be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beerſheba,</hi> &amp;c.] Huſhai aimed at Davids good in this counſel, that he might have the more reſpite to ſtrengthen himſelf, and might not be ſuddenly ſurprized; yet it was ſo ordered too, that it was very like to take with Abſalom: for firſt, it was cunningly fitted to this young gallants ambitious and inſolent humour, who was like to deſire to have the leading forth of his army himſelf (whereas Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thophel adviſed that he might go out with a party) and to be enflamed with the thoughts of having <hi>all Iſrael gathered,</hi> to follow him, <hi>from Dan, even to Beerſheba, as the ſand that is by the ſea for multitude:</hi> and ſecondly, it carried a fair ſhew of wiſdome, to make as ſure work as could be, in a buſineſſe of ſuch conſequence, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by raiſing all the ſtrength that poſſibly they could, ere they ſet upon David.</p>

Now in ſpeaking of pulling down this citie, he mentions the pulling of it into the river, becauſe great and ſtrong cities ſtand uſually upon ſome river, waters being alwayes of great uſe and of great defence to any citie; or elſe by the river muſt be meant the trenches about the citie, which in the beſt forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied cities are uſually great, and full of water.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Now therefore ſend quickly, and tell David ſaying, Lodge not this night in the plain,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Abſalom and the reſt had preferred Huſhai's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel before Ahithophels, yet Huſhai like a prudent man, not knowing how ſuddenly their minds might alter again and embrace Ahithophels counſel, which now they had rejected, takes order to give David notice of that which had paſſed, and to adviſe him to haſt away with all the ſpeed he could, leaſt they ſhould ſuddenly go forth, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hithophel had adviſed, and ſurpriſe him ere he was aware of them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz ſtayed by Enrogel,</hi> &amp;c.] Which was in the borders of Judah and Benjamin not farre from Jeruſalem: See Joſh. 15.7. and 18.16. there they ſtayed becauſe <hi>they might not be ſeen to come into the citie,</hi> to wit, becauſe then they could not ſafely go forth thence to carry David tidings of that which paſſed in the citie, or becauſe they were ſuſpected; and a wench was ſent to tell them this counſel of Huſhai who might go to Enrogel (which ſignifies, <hi>the fullers fountain,</hi>) under a pretence of going to fetch water, or to waſh there: and ſo the intelligence was carried to David.</p>

Chron. 2.17. this Ithra is called Jether the Iſhmaelite, <hi>And Abigail bare Amaſa, and the father of Amaſa was Jether the Iſhmaelite:</hi> it ſeems therefore, that he was either an Iſhmaelite by birth, but an Iſraelite by profeſſion and habitation, and that becauſe he became a proſelite, and ſo joyned himſelf to the people of God; or elſe rather, he was an Iſraelite by deſcent, and was onely called Ithra, or Jether the Iſhmaelite, becauſe he had lived among the Iſhmaelites, as ſeverall others upon the ſame ground were called Hittites and Gittites, &amp;c. nor can there indeed be any probable reaſon conceived, why this ſhould be ſo particularly expreſſed here, that he was <hi>an Iſraelite,</hi> but onely this that it was to intimate, that however he was indeed generally called Ithra, or Jether the Iſhmaelite, yet he was indeed of the ſtock of Iſrael as others were; as for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abigail (of whom Ithra begat this Amaſa, but not in lawfull marriage, for ſo much the words ſeem to import, that he <hi>went in to Abigail,</hi>) it is ſaid here, that ſhe was <hi>the daughter of Nahaſh ſiſter to Zeruiah Joabs mother:</hi> now becauſe it is evident, 1.

It ſeems that the gates of cities were in thoſe times built (as they are now) with high towers, and ſo ſtronger and thicker then other parts of the wall, and therefore had two gates, one inward toward the citie, and another outward toward the ſuburbs, and between theſe two gates it was that David now ſate.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And the king ſaid, If he be alone there is tidings in his mouth.]</hi> That is, if there were many coming together, we might well fear they fled from the face of the enemy; but if there be but one alone, doubtleſſe it is a meſſenger that is ſent with ſome tidings.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And the king ſaid He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.]</hi> David inferres, that if it were Ahimaaz that was coming he doubtleſſe brought good tidings, becauſe he was <hi>a good man;</hi> whereof there may be two reaſons concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Firſt, that being a good man, he was not likely to be the firſt in flying away; and therefore it was not likely he fled from the enemy, but rather he came with ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate.]</hi> See the note above, verſ. 5. partly as apprehending the miſery of Abſaloms dying in his ſinne, and partly as remembring that his ſinne in the matter of Uriah, was now puniſhed in the death of this his ungracious ſonne, he felt his paſſions breaking out ſo violently, that not being able to go home to his own houſe, and being withall doubtles aſhamed that his paſſion ſhould be ſeen, he was glad to run up to the chamber over the gate, where he was ſitting when he heard the tidings, there in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to poure out his ſorrow; nor was he able to ſuppreſſe his paſſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>But the king covered his face,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, chap. 15.30.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5, <hi>And Joab came into the houſe to the king, and ſaid, Thou haſt ſhamed this day the faces of all thy ſervants,</hi> &amp;c.] Joab ſaw that there was ſome danger, leſt the hearts of Davids friends and ſervants, ſhould be alienated from him, by his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of himſelf ſo diſreſpectfully to thoſe that had hazarded their lives for him; and he perceived too that his paſſions were ſo violent, that there was no way to winne him to withſtand them, unleſſe he ſpake that which might ſtartle him and ſcare him, and hence it was that he ſpake ſo roughly and ſharply to David, more roughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed then otherwiſe it had been fit for a ſubject to ſpeak to his ſovereigne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Now therefore ariſe, go forth, and ſpeak comfortably unto thy ſervants,</hi> &amp;c.] This Joab adviſed David to do, that he might prevent the alienating of his ſervants affections from him, and perhaps too becauſe the addreſſing of himſelf to the affairs of his kingdome, would be the beſt means to allay his paſſions, and indeed after that he came forth and ſat in the gate, we heare no more of his violent weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wailing.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And all the people were at ſtrife throughout all the tribes of Iſrael</hi> &amp;c.] That is, throughout all the ten tribes of the Iſraelites, the people began to blame one another, for ſiding with Abſalom in his inſurrrection againſt his father, and to call upon their Elders and Officers to go and ſubmit themſelves to him, and to fetch him back again into the land of Iſrael, to the citie of Jeruſalem, that he might be reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the throne, to reigne over them again, as he had done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Abſalom whom we anointed over us, is dead in battel,</hi> &amp;c.] This is another argument wherewith the Iſraelites perſwaded one another to ſubmit themſelves again to David, and it is as if they had ſaid, we ſee that God was againſt us in that attempt of ours to make Abſalom king, and why do we then ſtill ſtand it out, and not go in and ſeek reconciliation with our king whom we have wronged?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And king David ſent to Zadok, and to Abiathar the prieſts, ſaying, Speak unto the Elders of Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] The men of Judah had been the firſt, and chief in ſiding with Abſalom, and had delivered up to him the citie of Jeruſalem, and the ſtrong fort of Sion, and being therefore conſcious to themſelves of much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude againſt their ſovereigne, and fearing withall his juſt diſpleaſure againſt them, they durſt not think of going forth to meet him; David therefore by the prieſts who had ſtayed all this while in Jeruſalem, ſends them word how ready he was to pardon and forget all that was paſt, <hi>Why are you the laſt to bring the king back to his houſe?</hi> and aſſures them that his affection to them was ſingular, as being his brethren of the ſame tribe with himſelf, <hi>Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones, and my fleſh,</hi> and acquainting them what he had heard concerning the reſolution of the other tribes, warns them to take heed that they were not the laſt in fetching home their king that had cauſe to be the firſt: and thus was David a notable type of Chriſt, who doth alſo fetch in rebels to God, by proclaiming the tidings of mercy to them, the terrours of the Law may ſcare ſinners, and make them deſire if it were poſſible, to runne away from God, but it is the tender of grace in the Goſpel, that makes them come in and ſubmit themſelues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:42229:216"/>Verſ. 13. <hi>And ſay ye to Amaſa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.] David doubting that Amaſa, deſpairing of the pardon of his offence, might draw from him a great part of the ſtrength of Iſrael, now under his command, he ſent particularly to him, both to aſſure him that he was ready to receive him into his favour again, and to give him the reſpect of a near kinſman (for he was indeed his ſiſters ſonne, 1. Chron. 2.16, 17.) and alſo to proffer him the place of captain of the hoſt, (the place which Abſalom had given him, and which Joab now enjoyed, and had long ſince purchaſed by his valour, 1. Chron. 11.6.) <hi>God do ſo to me, and more alſo, if thou be not captain of the hoſt before me continually, in the room of Joab:</hi> and thus did David ſeek both to ſatisfie Amaſa, and winne him to come in, and withall to weaken the exceſſive power of Joab, who had alwayes carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too too inſolently towards him, and had now lately much provoked him, both by ſlaying Abſalom, againſt his expreſſe command, and ſpeaking ſo roughly and rudely to him, when he was in heavineſſe lamenting his death.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of Amaſa, that upon this promiſe made to him, by David, he preſently inclined the hearts of all the men of Judah to David, ſo that unanimouſly they ſent to the king, their deſire, that he ſhould return to Jeruſalem again, and the tender of their fealtie and alleageance to him, as in former times; but I rather think with others, that this is ſpoken of David, and that it is mentioned as the happy effect of this his wiſe, and gentle carriage of himſelf, both towards the men of Judah in generall, and Amaſa in particular; namely, that herewith <hi>he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah,</hi> to deſire unanimouſly to ſettle him again in the throne; it might have coſt a great deal of bloud to have ſubdued them by force; but by theſe tenders of grace, he bowed their hearts to him, even according to his own deſire.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And they went over Jordan before the king.]</hi> That is, before the king came over, to wit, to meet him there on the other ſide, and to fetch him over.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>I am come the firſt this day of all the houſe of Joſeph, to go down to meet my Lord the king.]</hi> It may be juſtly queſtioned why Shimei, who was of the tribe of Benjamin, chap. 16.5. ſhould here ſay, <hi>I am come the firſt this day of all the houſe of Joſeph;</hi> but to this two anſwers may be given, which have good evidence of reaſon in them (to omit others that are not ſo ſatisfactory as theſe are) to wit, firſt, that hereby is meant, that he was the firſt of all the tribes of Iſrael that came to the king, as conſidered apart from the tribe of Judah: the Scripture is wont ordinarily to divide the tribes into Judah and Iſrael, and the tribes of Iſrael ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoned a part from Judah, are uſually called Ephraim (becauſe that was the chief of thoſe tribes) as Eſa. 7.2. <hi>Syria is confederate with Ephraim;</hi> and the houſe of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Pſal. 80.1. <hi>Give eare O ſhepherd of Iſrael, thou that leadeſt Joſeph like a flock:</hi> and Zach. 10.6. <hi>I will ſtrengthen the houſe of Judah, and I will ſave the houſe of Joſeph:</hi> and ſo here in the ſame regard all the tribes of Iſrael, as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Judah, are comprehended under theſe words, <hi>the houſe of Joſeph:</hi> or ſecondly, that hereby is meant that he was come before any of the houſe of Joſeph, <hi>I am come the firſt this day of all the houſe of Joſeph:</hi> that is, I am come before any of the tribes of Iſrael, and becauſe indeed where Judah and Iſrael, or the houſe of Judah, are diſtinguiſhed in the Scriptures, Benjamin is uſually reckoned with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:42229:217"/>
therefore many Expoſitours do rather approve of this laſt reſolution of this doubt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And David ſaid, What have I to do with you ye ſonnes of Zeruiah, that ye ſhould this day be adverſaries unto me?]</hi> That is, that you ſhould adviſe me to that which may prove ſo exceeding prejudiciall to me; my adverſaries could not wiſh me more hurt, then this which you adviſe may bring upon me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For do not I know, that I am this day king over Iſrael?]</hi> That is, am I not this day reeſtabliſhed again in my kingdome, which I had in a manner loſt? and would it be convenient to damp the joy of this day with ſhedding bloud? or would it be ſafe to beat off them that begin now to ſubmit themſelves, and to endanger my yet unſettled eſtate, by ſhewing ſuch ſeveritie to him that firſt ſtooped, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fault? and ſhould not Gods mercy in reſtoring me to my kingdome, induce me to ſhew mercy to others?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Therefore the king ſaid unto Shimei, Thou ſhalt not die, and the king ſware unto him.]</hi> Yet at his death, he gave Solomon charge to put him to death, 1. kings 2.9. <hi>his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with bloud,</hi> as perſwading himſelf happely, that therein he ſhould not break his oath: firſt, becauſe he ſware onely for himſelf, that he would not put him to death, <hi>I ſware to him by the Lord, ſaying, I will not put thee to death:</hi> ſecondly, becauſe he did not (as it may ſeem) abſolutely enjoyn his ſonne to put him to death for this fact, but to take ſome other occaſion to do it, for ſo much thoſe words ſeem to imply, which there he uſeth: <hi>thou art a wiſe man, and knoweſt what thou oughteſt to do unto him,</hi> namely, that if he watched and obſerved him well, his malice and wickedneſſe would break forth, and give occaſion enough, in ſomewhat or other, to proceed againſt him in a way of juſtice, and ſo then he might puniſh him for all together.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And he anſwered, My Lord O king, my ſervant deceived me, for thy ſervant ſaid, I will ſadle me an aſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in that when Mephiboſheth had told him that he would have an aſſe ſadled, that he might ride to the king, he took away the aſſes, and went ſecretly to David, leaving him behind, a poore lame man, no way able to help himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>For all of my fathers houſe were but dead men before my Lord the king,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, we were in thy power, thou mighteſt have put us all to death, and enough thou hadſt been provoked by our family eſpecially by the attempt which Iſhboſheth made, and <hi>therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what right have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</hi> that is, what cauſe have I therefore to complain, though that which was given me, when there was ſo little cauſe for it, be now taken away.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And the king ſaid unto him Why ſpeakeſt thou any more of thy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? I have ſaid, Thou and Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ba divide the land.]</hi> Some underſtand this thus, as if he had ſaid, thou needeſt ſay no more, I believe and approve thy excuſe, the latter ſentence given upon Ziba's ſlander to wit, that he ſhould have thy land. I recall, and do reeſtabliſh my former, which was, that <hi>thou and Ziba divide the land</hi> that is, that Ziba ſhall occupy the land to halves for thy uſe, for this they conceive was the order which David appointed at firſt chap. 9.10. to wit that Ziba ſhould till the land, &amp;c. and then he ſhould have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alf the encreaſe for his coſt and labour and the other half Mephiboſheth ſhould have, and that this David did now again eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:42229:217"/>
and that therefore David uſeth theſe words, <hi>I have ſaid,</hi> as having reſpect to his firſt order. But moſt Expoſitours do farre otherwiſe underſtand this ſentence, and I think rightly, to wit, that David as ſtill ſcarce fully ſatisfied concerning Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth, and not willing to give any diſcontent to Ziba, eſpecially at this time, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended haſte, that he had not leiſure to examine the buſineſſe any further, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at all adventures reſolved to go a middle way, and ſo to determine it thus, that they ſhould divide the land betwixt them; <hi>I have ſaid,</hi> that is, this I decree, and it ſhall not be altered, <hi>thou and Ziba divide the land:</hi> and indeed, if this were not the meaning of his words, why ſhould Mephiboſheth have anſwered David to ſhew himſelf contented, verſ. 30. <hi>Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace,</hi> &amp;c. It is indeed very ſtrange, that David ſo good and juſt a king, ſhould paſſe ſuch an unjuſt ſentence, eſpecially againſt Mephiboſheth, the ſonne of his beloved Jonathan, with whom he had made a ſolemn covenant, that he would ſhew kindneſſe to him, and to his ſeed after him: for firſt, the tale that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth told was in it ſelf very fair and probable: ſecondly, even the poor plight wherein he was (for he had <hi>neither dreſſed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor waſhed his clothes,</hi> ſince the king went from Jeruſalem) made his report of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe the more credible, there being no appearance in this of one that affected to be king of Iſrael, as Ziba had ſlandered him: and thirdly, Ziba's being preſent and not anſwering a word to what Mephiboſheth ſaid, made the truth of this charge unqueſtionable: but it ſeems David was loth to diſpleaſe Ziba by taking back from him all that he had given him, eſpecially at this time, when he was ſo deſirous to endear himſelf to every body as much as he might, and therefore he hoped to ſalve all by appointing them to divide the land between them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And the king ſaid unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jeruſalem.]</hi> Thus David was carefull to requite thoſe that had ſhewed him kindneſſe in his affliction; and ſo will Chriſt remember their love, and requite their kindneſſe abundantly that afford any help or relief, to him or to his poor members, Matt. 25.34, 35. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: For I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat, I was thirſty and ye gave me drink,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>And all the people of Judah conducted the king, and alſo half the people of Iſrael.]</hi> That is, thoſe of Iſrael that had ſtuck to the king in the warre, and fell not from him, and ſuch as were ſince come and were reconciled to him, as that thouſand of Benjamin, verſ. 17. yet the preciſe half is not to be underſtood, but onely a part, to wit, that they were not ſo wholly there, as the men of Judah were.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>And the men of Iſrael anſwered the men of Judah, and ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have ten parts in the king,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as being ten of the twelve tribes, for the men of Benjamin were with Judah.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the words of the men of Judah, were fiercer then the words of the men of Iſrael</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, when they anſwered this objection of the men of Iſrael, they did not ſeek to appeaſe the Iſraelites of the ten tribes, but when they came to reply upon them, their language was fiercer and rougher then the others had been.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd there happened to be there a man of Belial, whoſe name was Sheba,</hi> &amp;c.] As bones new ſet are eaſily put out again, ſo a people that have broken out into ſedition and newly quieted, if they be not very charily handled, are apt upon every light occaſion to make a new inſurrection, and ſo it was now with the Iſraelites; for by occaſion of the quarrell between them and the men of Judah, mentioned in the latter end of the foregoing chapter, <hi>Sheba the ſonne of Bichria man of Belial,</hi> as he is here termed (concerning which ſee the note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deut. 13.13.) perſwaded the Iſraelites preſently to caſt of Davids government; and the motion he made, they as readily embraced, <hi>We have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the ſonne of Jeſſe:</hi> in which words, though it may ſeem he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to ſome phraſe of ſpeech uſuall amongſt the Iſraelites when they diſclaimed their intereſt in any thing, and therefore we ſee the ten tribes uſed the ſame form of ſpeech, when they revolted from Rehoboam, 1. Kings 12.16. <hi>The people anſwered the king, ſaying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the ſonne of Jeſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Yet withall, he intimates the reaſon, why they ſhould no longer be Davids ſubjects: namely, becauſe they were ſleighted, as if they had no part in the king, and therefore ſaith he, what is the ſonne of Jeſſe to us, let the men of Judah enjoy him wholly to themſelves, and let us chooſe a king of our own; his ſcornfull ſpeaking of David ſhews, that as a Benjamite he ſtill grudged at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the kingdome from their tribe in the houſe of Saul.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep his houſe, and put them in ward,</hi> &amp;c.] This David did, firſt, becauſe they had yeilded to the inceſtuous luſt of Abſalom; (for they ſhould rather have dyed then condeſcended to him) and ſecondly, becauſe he judged it not fit to go in unto them, that had been defiled by his own ſonne, or to leave them to be defiled by others.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Then ſaid the king to Amaſa, Aſſemble me the men of Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus as he had promiſed, chap. 19.13. David imployed Amaſa as the generall of his forces in Joabs room.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>But he tarried longer then the ſet time which he had appointed him.]</hi> To wit, either becauſe the people that had been formerly commanded by Joab, were not willing to change their Generall and to ſubmit to Amaſa, or becauſe Amaſa did not cordially follow the buſineſſe for David, or becauſe indeed, the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by David for raiſing the trained bands of Judah was too little to do it in, for out of a deſire that David had preſently to cruſh this inſurrection of the ten tribes, he had allowed Amaſa but three dayes for that ſervice, as is expreſſed in the former verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And David ſaid to Abiſhai, Now ſhall Sheba the ſonne of Bichri do us more harm,</hi> &amp;c.] David was much troubled at Amaſa's delay, but yet Joab he would not imploy, both becauſe he was ſtill diſcontented againſt him for his killing Abſalom, and becauſe he knew well that Joab was alſo diſcontented for the loſſe of his place, and ſhould he be now imployed again, would be ready enough to preſſe into that place again, from which he had depoſed him; and therefore he called Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai

and ſent out him, and enjoyned him to take his Lords ſervants, that is, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids the kings guard, and with them to purſue Sheba.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And there went out after him Joabs men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites,</hi> &amp;c.] Thoſe are called Joabs men, that had been under his command, as for the Cherechites and Pelethites, ſee the note, chap. 8.18.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>But Amaſa took no heed to the ſword that was in Joabs hand</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he never thought of any danger that was in that, he took that to be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, by the caſuall and unexpected falling of his ſword out of his ſcabbard as he came to ſalute him, and therefore hearing him ſpeak ſo ſmoothly, and ſeeing him embrace him ſo lovingly, he never ſuſpected any danger in his ſword; and thus was Amaſa puniſhed by the juſt hand of Gods providence for his unnaturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt his uncle David his Lord and Sovereign; though David had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him, God would not ſuffer him to go unpuniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And one of Joabs men ſtood by him, and ſaid, He that favoureth Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab,</hi> &amp;c.] Leaſt the ſight of their ſlain Generall ſhould beat off the ſouldiers from going any further, one of Joabs men ſtood by him, no doubt by Joabs appointment, as it were to juſtifie the fact, and to adviſe them if they were friends to Joab, and the king, to go on after him, who would now be their leader in this enterprize, which David had neither juſtly nor ſafely committed to Amaſa's truſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And Amaſa wallowed in bloud.]</hi> To wit, by reaſon of the pangs of death that were upon him.</p>

                     <hi>And when the man ſaw that all the people ſtood ſtill,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when the man mentioned in the foregoing verſe, that had encouraged the ſouldiers to march on after Joab, ſaw that for all this, they ſtood ſtill as aſtoniſhed at that which was done, he removed Amaſa's dead body out of the high way.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And he went through all the tribes of Iſrael unto Abel, and to Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maachah,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Sheba having gone through all the tribes to ſtirre them up againſt David, came at length to Abel, and to the places adjoyning, where Joab found him.</p>

the citizens of Abel perſwaded themſelves, that ſurely Joab would before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to force them, propound his demands to them, and ſo they ſhould make an end of the difference: but as the words are rendred in the text, they may have a double ſenſe: for firſt, ſome expound it much after the ſame manner, to wit, that in old time they were wont to ſay according to the expreſſe law of God, Deut. 20.10. that when they came againſt a citie, they were firſt to make their demands and to propound conditions of peace, and ſo they ended the matter, as if ſhe had ſaid, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had this enterpriſe been undertaken in former times, they would not have done as thou haſt, they would have ſaid, Surely we will firſt ask at Abel, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will conſent to do what we ſhall require of them: ſecondly, ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be an allegation of an old proverb, <hi>They were wont to ſpeak in old time, ſaying, They ſhall ſurely ask counſel at Abel:</hi> to wit, becauſe it ſeems there were in times paſt in this citie, men eminent: for wiſdome and abilitie to give counſel, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning the laws, inſomuch that they uſed to come up from all parts of the kingdome to take advice there, and ſo they ended the matter; that is, many a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie was thus peaceably dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>I am one of them that are peaceable and faithfull in Iſrael.]</hi> Here this wiſe woman of Abel doth further diſſwade Joab from proceeding with ſuch ſeverity againſt this Citie by three ſeverall Arguments; firſt, by pleading their innocency, <hi>I am one of them that are peaceable and faithfull in Iſrael:</hi> for this ſhe ſpeaks not of her ſelf in particular, there being no reaſon that the whole citie ſhould be ſpared, becauſe ſhe was peaceable, but ſhe ſpeaks in the name and perſon of the whole citie; to wit, that their citie Abel was <hi>peaceable and faithfull;</hi> and indeed it may well be, that either the citie knew nothing of Sheba's guilt, and did ſhut their gates not to defend Sheba but onely becauſe they heard of an Army that was coming againſt them: or at leaſt that though there might be a faction in the citie, that were abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Sheba, yet for the generality of the people they were otherwiſe minded; and this ſhe alledgeth to juſtifie the citie, and to ſtay the rage of Joab: ſecondly, by pleading the dammage that would redound to the Iſrael of God by the ruine of this citie, <hi>Thou ſeekest to destroy a citie, and a mother in Iſrael,</hi> that is, the chief citie of a Province, a mother citie. The chief cities of a Countrey are called in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, mothers, partly in regard of the multitude of the Inhabitants which are there bred and brought up as it were in the lap and boſome of a mother, and are by her defended and ſheltred from the violence of thoſe that would hurt them, and liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for, and ſent forth perhaps into other parts of the land with a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of outward things, but principally in regard of the towns and villages about them, either becauſe the cities had the command over them, or at leaſt becauſe the towns and villages had much dependance upon them, as children upon their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for counſell and direction in their weightieſt affairs, for defence againſt invading enemy, and for a ſupply of thing, convenient for them; and ſo this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tearms her citie <hi>a mother in Iſrael,</hi> to ſhew what a miſchief he ſhould do to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42229:219"/>
the land of Iſrael, in ruinating ſuch a citie; and thirdly by pleading the wrong that therein would be done unto the Lord, in that the people were the people of God that were like to be deſtroyed in it, and the citie a part of the inheritance wherein God had placed his people, <hi>Why wilt thou</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>ſwallow up the inheritance of the Lord?</hi> where alſo the expreſſion ſhe uſeth of ſwallowing up the inheritance of the Lord, is very obſervable, for thereby ſhe covertly blames him for his violent and furious proceedings againſt them, and intimateth that if he would not do all in a paſſion, but would a little deliberate of theſe his proceedings, he would be ſoon of another mind.</p>

                     <hi>And the woman ſaid unto Joab, behold his head ſhall be thrown to thee over the wall.]</hi> This ſhe promiſeth with ſuch confidence, either becauſe ſhe knew already the minds of thoſe that were able to do it, or becauſe ſhe was aſſured they would be wonne to it, and not hazard the citie to ſhelter a Traitour; and indeed that the inhabitants were by her perſwaded to yield to this, the words in the following verſe ſeem clearly to imply, <hi>Then the woman went unto all the people in her wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> &amp;c. that is, by her wiſdome in pleading with them, and the ſtrong reaſons ſhe alledged, ſhe perſwaded the Citizens to cut off his head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen there was a famine in the dayes of David, three years, yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeare, and David enquired of the Lord.]</hi> Though this ſtory of the three years famine, be here related after that of Abſaloms rebellion, and Sheba's inſurrection againſt David, yet it is generally held that both this and the following ſtory, chap. 24. happened long before, and indeed if Abſaloms rebellion was in the the fourtieth yeare of his fathers reigne, who reigned in all but fourty years, chap. 5.4. as many gather from chap. 15.7. <hi>And it came to paſſe that after fourtie years, Abſalom ſaid unto the King,</hi> &amp;c. this conſequently muſt needs be before that, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe all theſe fore-mentioned troubles that befell David, befell him for his ſinne with Bathſheba, therefore are they there inſerted immediately after that, and theſe that concerned other matters are afterward related by themſelves; the Scripture ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpecting the coherence of the matter and argument, then the conſequence of the time, and ſo much methinks the very Text doth imply, giving no other note of

the time, but that it was <hi>in the dayes of David;</hi> though the ſinne was long ſince committed, yet at length God began to puniſh the whole land for it by ſending a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine amongſt them, cauſed as it ſeems, verſ. 10. by want of rain; and how ever at firſt David took it as a puniſhment laid upon them for the common ſinnes of the land, yet when he ſaw that it continued three years together, he concluded there was ſome ſpeciall thing wherewith God was offended, and for which he would be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and therefore then he <hi>enquired of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Lord anſwered, It is for Saul, and for his bloudy houſe, becauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites.]</hi> That is, many of the Gibeonites: in the following verſe it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed expreſſed, that he endeavoured to root them all out of the land; <hi>Saul ſought to ſtay them in his zeal to the children of Iſrael and Judah,</hi> to wit, as pretending that it was neither profitable, nor honourable, nor ſafe for Gods people to ſuffer any of thoſe curſed nations to live amongſt them, whom God hath commanded them utterly to deſtroy. Exod. 23.33. Deut. 7.2. but it ſeems he did not openly profeſſe this which he had purpoſed with himſelf: (for this would have been too manifeſt an act of tryranny and injuſtice, and too palpable a violation of the oath which Joſhua and the Elders of Iſrael had taken, that they ſhould live peaceably amongſt them, Joſh. 9.15. and beſides had he gone this way to work, the poore Gibeonites could never have eſcaped his fury) no, though his intentions were utterly to root them all out of the land, yet the way he took to effect it was by picking quarrells ſeverally againſt them, ſome at one time, and ſome at another, that ſo he might cut them off by degrees, and that under a pretence of Juſtice, either by charging them with forged accuſations, or by aggravating any ſmaller offence, and making it to them capitall, or ſome ſuch other wayes of heavie oppreſſion; and thus intending to proceed in this cloſe politick way though he ſlew many of them as is here expreſſed, yet it ſeems he was ſome way taken off before he could accompliſh what he had determined: however for this cruelty of Sauls againſt the Gibeonites, it was as the Lord here tells David that the famine had been ſo long upon the land. <hi>It is for Saul, and for his bloudy houſe, becauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites:</hi> Indeed conſidering what an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable act of cruelty that of Sauls was, when he ſlew foureſcore and five of the Prieſts, and utterly deſtroyed their citie with all that were therein, <hi>both men and women, children and ſucklings,</hi> &amp;c. It is ſtrange that Sauls poſterity were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an account for that cruelty of Sauls againſt the Prieſts of the Lord, as well as for this againſt the Gibeonites: but for this two reaſons may be probably given; firſt that it was to let the Iſraelites ſee that God will be avenged for ſhedding the bloud of the meaneſt, ſuch as the Gibeonites were, who were as bondmen and ſlaves to the Iſraelites, as well as for ſhedding the bloud of the greateſt: ſecondly, that it was to let the Jewes ſee that thoſe of other Nations, if they were of the faith of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and were once received to be his people, were as acceptable to God, and as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his ſight as the Jewes were; and thirdly, that it was to diſcover how the Lord abhorres all falſifying of oaths and covenants, in that he proceeded with ſuch ſeverity againſt Sauls poſterity, becauſe he had done the Gibeonites conrary to what Joſhua and the Iſraelites had covenanted and ſworn many hundred years ago; ſo hatefull to God all perſidiouſneſſe is, whatſoever pretences are put upon it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>The Gibeonites were not of the children of Iſrael, but of the remnant of the Amorites,</hi>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:42229:220"/>
&amp;c.] The Gibeonites were Hivites, Joſh. 9.7. <hi>And the men of Iſrael ſaid unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us,</hi> &amp;c. But both Hivites, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the inhabitants of Canaan, are uſually in the Scripture called Amorites, Gen. 15.16. <hi>For the iniquitie of the Amorites is not yet full.</hi> Ezek. 16.3. <hi>Thy Father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Wherefore David ſaid unto the Gibeonites, What ſhall I do for you?]</hi> &amp;c. It ſeems by this, that when David enquired of the Lord, he did not onely tell him wherefore this famine was ſent, but alſo enjoined him to ſatiſfie the Gibeonites for the wrong which had been done them: for why elſe ſhould he allow them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what ſhould be done?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And wherewith ſhall I make the atonement, that ye may bleſſe the inheritance of the Lord?]</hi> That is, that ye may pray for the people of God, and the land which God hath given them for their inheritance: becauſe the Lord had pleaded the cauſe of the Gibeonites by ſending a famine upon the whole land of Iſrael, David looked upon them as men highly favoured of God, and therefore was the more deſirous that they ſhould pray for them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>We will have no ſilver nor gold of Saul, nor of his houſe, neither for us ſhalt thou kill any man in Iſrael.]</hi> That is, ſave onely of his family that did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe us.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Let ſeaven men of his ſonnes be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, to ſatisfie his juſtice, and appeaſe his wrath, and that others by this example may learn to keep covenant, and not to oppreſſe the ſtranger that is taken under Gods protection: See the note Numb. 25.4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>But the King tooke the two ſonnes of Rizpah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the five ſonnes of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom ſhe brought up for Adriel,</hi> &amp;c.] It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that not Michal but Merab her elder ſiſter, was married to this Adriel the ſon of Barzillai, called the Meholathite, becauſe he was of Abel-meholah in the Tribe of Benjamin, Judg. 7.22. and to diſtinguiſh him from Barzillai the Gileadite, chap. 19.31. 1. Sam. 18.19. <hi>When Merab Sauls daughter ſhould have been given to David, ſhe was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife;</hi> and that Michal had no children to her dying day, 2. Sam. 6.22. <hi>Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death;</hi> and therefore doubtleſſe theſe five ſonnes of Adriel were the children of Merab Michals ſiſter, and were onely brought up by Michal as her own (ſhe having no children) and therefore called her ſonnes, but are ſaid to be brought up for Adriel her ſiſters husband.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And they hanged them in the hil before the Lord.]</hi> That is, in a hill in Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah of Saul, verſ. 6. that they might be a ſpectacle of Gods indignation againſt Saul for that ſinne of his in ſlaying the Gibeonites, and thus did the Lord, puniſh that cruelty of Saul toward the Gibeonites, and withall did provide for the ſetling of the Kingdome upon David and his ſeed, by cutting off the poſterity of Saul, leſt they ſhould be ſtill plotting and practiſing againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Rizpah the daughter of Ajah took ſackcloth and ſpread it for her upon the rock,</hi> &amp;c.] Rizpah Sauls concubine the mother of two of thoſe that were hanged, knowing it ſeems that the bodies of her ſonnes were to hang up till God ſhould teſtifie that he was appeaſed by giving them rain again (wherein doubtleſſe
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42229:221"/>
David had ſpeciall direction from the Lord, for otherwiſe it had been againſt the expreſſe letter of the Law, Deut. 21.23. <hi>His body ſhall not all night remain upon the tree, but thou ſhalt bury him that day.</hi>) That ſhe might defend their bodies both from birds and beaſts, ſhe reſolved to watch them, and to that end ſhe took ſackcloth and ſpread <hi>it for her upon the rock;</hi> that is, ſhe ſpread therewith a Tent in the rock next adjoyning, the better to defend her from the heat, and withall perhaps to teſtifie her ſad and mournfull condition, in regard of this ſhamefull death of her children, and ſo continued watching them, <hi>untill water dropped upon them out of Heaven;</hi> till God ſent rain upon the land as was deſired; ſhe that had been Sauls concubine it is likely had ſervants to have done this; but ſuch was the ſtrength of her affection, that ſhe could not be ſatisfied, unleſſe ſhe did it, or ſaw it done her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And David went, and took the bones of Saul,</hi> &amp;c] Hearing as it is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, what affection Rizaph had ſhown to her ſonnes that were hanged, and how carefull ſhe had been to keep their dead bodies from being torn and mangled, that they might be decently interred, partly as being ſtirred up by the example of Rizpah, to ſhew the like reſpect to the dead bodies of Saul and his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and partly that this honourable buriall of her ſonnes, might be ſome comfort to that poore ſad woman, he went himſelf and fetched the bones of Saul and Jonathan, and buried them together with the bones of thoſe, that were lately hanged in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of Kiſh the father of Saul.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.]</hi> That is, after their bodies had been buried for ſome time; or elſe we muſt ſay, that the bodies hanged ſo long ere rain came, that the greateſt part, at leaſt of the fleſh, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And David waxed faint.]</hi> To wit, as being then grown old, and therefore not ſo well able to hold out in the fight, as formerly he had been.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt go no more out with us to battel, that thou quench not the light of Iſrael.]</hi> That is, for fear thou ſhouldeſt be ſlain, in whom conſiſts the conduct, joy, and life of thy people: kings are called in the Scripture the light of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1. Kings 15.4. <hi>The Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jeruſalem, to ſet up his ſonne after him:</hi> Pſal. 132.17. <hi>I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed:</hi> partly, becauſe by their wiſdome the people are governed, partly becauſe they are to ſhine as lights by good example; but principally, becauſe they are the means of ſo much joy and comfort to a people, and thence it is that the people here tell David, that by his death the light of Iſrael would be quenched.</p>

Pſalme, onely there are ſome clauſes here, that are expreſſed there in other words, and in ſome places a clauſe is now and then added alſo in one of them, which is not in the other, as here in the very beginning of the Pſalme we have not thoſe words, <hi>I will love thee, O Lord, my ſtrength,</hi> which are there prefixed, the reaſon whereof may be, as ſome Expoſitours conceive, becauſe here we have it, as it was at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by David; but there as it was afterwards reviſed, and upon ſecond thoughts, in ſome expreſſions, altered and changed, when he delivered it to the Levites to be ſung in the Temple: the reaſon why he uſeth here in the entrance of the Pſalme, ſuch variety of expreſſions to ſet forth the praiſe of God, calling him his rock, his fortreſſe, his deliverer, his ſhield, the horn of his ſalvation, his high tower, his refuge, his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, is partly, becauſe his heart was ſo full of thankfulneſſe upon the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his many deliverances, that this made him ſo abundantly to powre out his ſoul in the high praiſes of God, he thought he could never ſufficiently expreſſe them; and partly, becauſe he deſired hereby to ſet forth, what an alſufficient defence the Lord was unto him, that God was all in all for his preſervation, and that there was no ſecuritie to be thought on, but he had found it in God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>The God of my rock, in him will I truſt,</hi> &amp;c.] Pſal. 18. verſ. 2. this is expreſſed thus, <hi>my God, my strength, in whom I will truſt;</hi> and the laſt clauſe of this verſe. <hi>my refuge, my Saviour, thou ſavest me from violence,</hi> is not in the 18. Pſalme: as for the next words here, <hi>he is my ſheild, and the horn of my ſalvation:</hi> a horn ſignifieth in the Scripture, power, and glory, Pſal. 92.10. <hi>My horn ſhalt thou exalt, like the horn of an unicorn,</hi> Amos 6.13. <hi>Have we not taken to us horns, by our own strength:</hi> Hab. 3.4. <hi>He had horns coming out of his hand, and there was the hiding of his power:</hi> horns therefore are uſed to ſignifie kings, Dan. 8.21. <hi>The great horn that is between his eyes, is the firſt king:</hi> Rev. 17.12. <hi>And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt, are ten kings,</hi> &amp;c. in which regard Chriſt is called an horn of ſalvation, Luke 1.69. God therefore is here called by David the horn of his ſalvation, to imply, that by him he had been advanced and enabled, both to defend himſelf, and to puſh down his enemies before him.</p>

                     <pb n="424" facs="tcp:42229:222"/>Verſ 5 <hi>When the waves of death compaſſed me: the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.]</hi> To expreſſe the condition he was in, by reaſon of his enemies, David compares them here to waves, and floods of waters: firſt, to ſet forth the multitude of his enemies, they came in amain to Saul from all parts of the kingdome, to take part againſt David, as in a flood the waves come tumbling, and rowling one in the neck of another: ſecondly, to ſignifie the violent rage of his enemies who were in this regard like floods of water that come rowling down from hills, and mountains, and carry all before them: and thirdly, to intimate that yet like land floods, that continued not long, their roaring rage made him afraid, but that fear did drive him to God (as it follows in the next verſe,) and then their rage was ſoon ſtilled, and ſo his former fears made him now the more thankfull.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>The ſorrows of hell compaſſed me about, the ſnares of death prevented me.]</hi> That is, deadly ſorrows and dangers had ſo hemmed me in, that there ſeemed to be no poſſibilitie of eſcaping them, no more then there is of a ſick mans eſcape, that hath pangs of death already upon him, I was brought to the very brink of hell, or of the grave, there was but a ſtep betwixt me and death, 1. Sam. 20.3. and to the ſame purpoſe tends the next clauſe, <hi>the ſnares of death prevented me,</hi> that is, my enemies had ſo cunningly contrived their plots for my death, that like hidden ſnares they were ready to take hold on me ſuddenly, ere I was aware of them, in ſo much, that all hope of help ſeemed to be prevented; if help ſhould come, it would come too late.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God, and he did then heare my voice out of his Temple.]</hi> That is, he heard me out of heaven, which is here called the Temple of God, becauſe the Temple was a type of heaven: firſt, as being the place of Gods ſpeciall preſence (fot though God be every where preſent, yet in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he manifeſts his preſence in a more eminent manner then elſewhere:) ſecondly, in regard of the exceeding glory of heaven, which to ſhadow forth, the Temple was built ſo exceeding glorious: and thirdly, in regard of the tranſcendent holineſſe of heaven, whither no unclean thing ſhall ever enter, where God is continually ſerved by his Angels, and glorified Saints, and there is not the leaſt mixture of pollution in their ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Then the earth ſhook and trembled; the foundation of heaven moved,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe and the following words David ſheweth how the Lord in his hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, fought from heaven againſt his enemies, and poured forth his vengeance upon them, and that under the ſimilitude of a ſore tempeſtuous ſtorm, when the earth quakes, the air is covered with thick, black, and dark miſts, and ſends forth winds, rain, thunder, and lightning, &amp;c. firſt, to imply that the Lords power and terrible wrath, was as evidently to be ſeen, and as much to be admired in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his enemies, as in a horrid and terrible ſtorm, wherein every one is forced to acknowledge his hand: and ſecondly, to imply how ſuddenly God reſcued him and deſtroyed them; things were changed on a ſudden, as when a ſtorm unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectly ariſeth in the air: and thirdly, to allude to the puniſhment of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, when God reſcued his people thence, for the Scriptures do uſually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that redemption of Iſrael out of Egypt, that being as it were the archtype, or chief pattern, wherein God meant to let his people ſee, how in all ſucceeding ages, be would deliver them, and deſtroy their enemies; in Pſal. 18.7. this firſt clauſe is
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:42229:222"/>
expreſſed thus, <hi>the foundations of the hills moved,</hi> and the meaning is, that the hills were ſhaken even from their very foundations, or bottomes; but here theſe hills are called <hi>the foundations of heaven,</hi> as elſewhere alſo, to wit, Job. 26.11. <hi>the pillars of heaven,</hi> becauſe the tops of high mountains ſeems to touch the clouds, and the heavens ſeem to lean upon them; and becauſe the earth is in the centre of the world, about the which, the heavens do continually turn.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>He bowed the heavens alſo, and came down,</hi> &amp;c.] For in rainy and tempeſtuous weather, not onely the tops of hills ſeem covered with clouds, but every where the lower region of the air is filled with miſts, and cloudy darkneſſe; but withall ſome conceive, that this following expreſſion, <hi>and darkneſſe was under his feet,</hi> is uſed to imply Gods coming inviſibly to the help of David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And he rode upon a Cherub, and did flie: and he was ſeen upon the wings of the wind.]</hi> In Pſalme 18.10. it is, <hi>And he did flie upon the wings of the wind:</hi> David here ſpeaketh of ſtrong and violent winds, which the Lord alſo uſeth as his inſtruments in the execution of his judgements; he ſaith, that <hi>he rode upon a Cherub:</hi> to wit, becauſe the Lord governs the winds at his command, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Angels, they raiſe them, and they ſtill them: and they order them as God hath appointed, and he uſeth the word <hi>Cherub,</hi> rather then that of Angel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Angels were repreſented in the mercy ſeat and tabernacle, under the figure of golden-winged Cherubims, and he deſired ſo to expreſſe the power of God here, as withall, he might put them in mind, that it was that God who did all theſe things, that had entred into a ſpeciall covenant with Iſrael that he would be their God, and they ſhould be his people, and ſo dwelt among them in his tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And he made darkneſſe pavilions round about him.]</hi> To wit as a king that being angry, ſhould withdraw himſelf from his ſubjects, and not ſuffer them to ſee him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Through the brightneſſe before him were coals of fire kindled,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſomewhat varied, Pſal. 18.12, 13. <hi>At the brightneſſe that was before him his thick clouds paſſed, hail-stones and coals of fire. The Lord alſo thundred in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the higheſt gave his voice, hail-ſtones and coals of fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he ſent out arrows, and ſcattered them; lightning and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited them.]</hi> By Gods arrows here, are meant thunderbolts or hail-ſtones, &amp;c. as the hail-ſtones that fell upon the Canaanites, are called arrows, Hab. 3.11. and therefore alſo, Pſalme 18.14. the laſt clauſe is expreſſed thus, <hi>He ſhot out lightning, and diſcomfited them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And the chanels of the ſea appeared, the foundations of the world were diſcovered,</hi> &amp;c.] This is meant of the raging of the ſeas in tempeſtuous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the waves will riſe in ſuch an admirable manner, as if in the gulfs and breaches of the waves made thereby, the very channel and bottome of thoſe ſeas would be diſcovered and laid bare; yet withall, there may be in theſe words, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the drying up of the red ſea and Jordan before Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>He ſent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.]</hi> This expreſſion David uſeth, to imply how ſtrange and miraculous his deliverance was, as if a hand from heaven had been reached forth to ſnatch him up when he was ready to ſink.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:42229:223"/>Verſ. 18. <hi>He delivered me from my ſtrong enemy,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſeems to be meant of Saul in particular, but may be alſo underſtood indefinitely of all his ſtrong ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: the like may be ſaid of that clauſe, verſ. 49. <hi>Thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20, <hi>He brought me forth alſo into a large place,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he freed me out of all the ſtraits I was in, and this he did, not for any merit in me, but of his own free grace and favour, <hi>He delivered me becauſe he delighted in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, according to mine innocencie, in regard of mine enemies. Davids enemies charged him with ambition, rebellion againſt Saul, and many other grievous crimes; but they charged him unjuſtly, and therefore God that knew his integrity, took his part againſt his enemies: nor need we ſtartle at it, that David calls the good which God had done for him, a reward and a recompence; for though the obedience of Gods ſervants is a due debt which they owe to God, and it is God that enables them to do what they do; yet God of his own free grace may reward them that ſerve him, though their works be farre ſhort of that which they ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>For I have kept the wayes of the Lord, and have not wickedly depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my God.]</hi> That is, I have not caſt off that care and endeavour to walk in Gods wayes, which God requires in all his ſervants; becauſe every man by the law of nature is bound to obey the law of his Creatour, therefore when men do not herein keep cloſe to God, they do in a manner forſake him, there ſinne is in a degree a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from God: but yet becauſe Gods righteous ſervants do ſincerely deſire and endeavour to keep his laws, even then when they break them; therefore indeed their ſlips are not an abſolute defection from God, and to diſtinguiſh Davids failings from ſuch a deſperate apoſtaſie, ſpeaking here of his integrity, he expreſſeth it thus, that he not had <hi>wickedly</hi> departed from his God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Therefore the Lord hath recompenſed me according to my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, according to my cleanneſſe in his eye ſight.]</hi> Or, <hi>The cleanneſſe of my hands,</hi> as it is expreſſed, Pſalme 18.24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And with the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf unſavourie.]</hi> That is, as they walk croſſe and contrary to thee, ſo thou wilt walk contrary to them, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and croſſing them in all they do; according to that, Levit. 26.27 28. <hi>And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me, then I will walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto you alſo, in fury.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And the afflicted people thou wilt ſave, but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou maist bring them down.]</hi> This is added, to clear that which went before, though God ſeem not alwayes to deal with men as they deſerve, yet the iſſue ſhews he doth: for though the righteous be afflicted for a time, yet they at length ſhall be ſaved, and though the wicked proſper a while, yet at length in their pride they ſhall be be brought down, <hi>Thine eyes are upon the haughtie,</hi> or, <hi>Thou wilt bring down high looks,</hi> Pſalme 18.27. when he ſpares ſuch for a time, he doth but watch for an opportunitie to poure out his wrath among them: his eyes are upon them all the time to watch for a fit ſeaſon to ruine them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>For thou art my lamp, O Lord: and the Lord will lighten my dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.]</hi> Or as it is expreſſed, Pſalme 18.28. <hi>For thou wilt light my candle, the Lord
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42229:223"/>
my God will enlighten my darkneſſe:</hi> the meaning is, either that God would turn his affliction and grief into proſperity and comfort, according to that, Eſther 8.19. <hi>The Jews had light and gladneſſe, and joy and honour:</hi> or elſe, that God would direct him and comfort him in his afflictions, as God makes the wicked grope even at noon, ſo he cauſeth a light to ſhine upon his righteous ſervants, even in their greateſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by directing them what to do, when of themſelves, they know not which way to turn themſelves, and as a candle is a great comfort in the dark, though it doth not make day where it comes, as the ſunne doth, ſo it is a great mercy, when God doth chear up, and enlighten the ſpirits of his people in affliction, though he doth not take the affliction away.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>By my God have I leaped over a wall.]</hi> That is, I have not onely ſcaled their walls, and ſo have taken their cities, forts, and caſtles, but I have done it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily; but it may alſo be meant of his overcoming all difficulties that were in his way.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>The word of the Lord is tried.]</hi> That is, it hath been proved to be true, by unqueſtionable proof and experience.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>God is my ſtrength and power.]</hi> Or it is God that girdeth me with ſtrength, Pſalme 18.22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he maketh my way perfect.]</hi> That is, by him I fully accompliſh all my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, by his providence all impediments being removed, I fail not to perfect what I go about.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>He maketh my feet like hinds feet,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be meant of agility, and nimbleneſſe, a great help in martiall affairs, 1. Chron. 12.8. <hi>and were as ſwift: as Roes upon the mountains:</hi> but I conceive, it is rather meant of his ſudden and ſpeedy ſucceſſe, in taking the ſtrong forts of his enemies, that as hinds do ſuddenly runne up to the top of inacceſſible rocks, ſo he did ſuddenly take into his power the ſtrong towers and forts of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>A bow of ſteel is broken by mine arms.]</hi> It ſeems they had in thoſe times ſome bows made of ſteel, becauſe that is more flexible, and ſtronger then iron; whence is that, Job. 20.24, <hi>He ſhall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel ſhall ſtrike him through.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>And thy gentleneſſe hath made me great.]</hi> In Pſal. 18.35. it is, <hi>And thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleneſſe hath made me great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>Thou haſt enlarged my ſteps under me,</hi> &amp;c.] Thou haſt removed all impediments out of my way, that might hinder me in the enterprizes which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took; and by that means I went on freely without any rub: the contrary we ſee is affirmed of the wicked, Job 18.7. <hi>The steps of his strength ſhall be ſtraitned, and his own counſel ſhall cast him down:</hi> when a man goeth in a deep troubleſome way, he can hardly ſtirre his feet, but paſſeth on ſlowly; but in a plain way, he may take large ſteps, and make what ſpeed he will, hence is this expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And I have conſumed them,</hi> &amp;c.] Pſal. 18.38. <hi>I have wounded them that they were not able to riſe, they are fallen under my feet.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>Then did I beat them as ſmall as the duſt of the earth, I did ſtamp them as the mire of the ſtreet, and did ſpread them abroad.]</hi> In Pſal. 18.42. it is, <hi>Then did I beat them as ſmall as the dust before the wind, I did caſt them out as the dirt in the ſtreets:</hi> having ſaid before, that they looked to God, and he regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not, then he addes, <hi>then did I beat them,</hi> &amp;c. when God once withdraws his protection and help from a people, it is an eaſie matter to tread them down, and beat them in pieces.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 44. <hi>Thou alſo haſt delivered me from the ſtrivings of my people, thou haſt kept me to be the head of the heathen,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thou haſt not onely delivered me from mine own people, over whom thou wert pleaſed to anoint me king, when they roſe up againſt me (as we know they did in the warres that Saul made againſt him, in the rebellion of Abſalom, the inſurrection of Sheba, &amp;) but haſt alſo brought many nations of the heathens to be in ſubjection under me, and to acknowledge me, to be their Lord and head: now herein was David alſo a type of Chriſt; for firſt, the Jews that were Gods own peculiar people, and that pretended to truſt in the promiſed Meſſiah, were the cruelleſt enemies to Chriſt that ever he had, and ſo it hath been ſince too, amongſt thoſe that have profeſſed themſelves Chriſtians; never did Turks and infidels more for the ruin of Chriſts kingdome, then they have done; onely ſtill the ſtrivings of his people againſt his Scepter and government, have been in vain: and ſecondly, when the Gentiles were converted to the faith of Chriſt, he became then more truely then ever David was, <hi>the head of the heathen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 45. <hi>Strangers ſhall ſubmit themſelves unto me,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſtill intended both of David and of Chriſt, of whom David was a type; of David, in regard of the many neighbouring nations, that ſhould become tributaries to him; of Chriſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the converſion of the Gentiles, who were aliens and ſtrangers from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Iſrael, and did yet come in and ſubmit themſelves to Chriſt the ſonne of David. In the margin theſe words are rendred thus, <hi>Strangers ſhall yield fained obedience unto me:</hi> and indeed, as it was no doubt true of many of the heathens that were ſubdued by David, that they ſubmitted themſelves to him, becauſe they durſt do no other: either for fear of being deſtroyed, or becauſe the greateſt number yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then it was in vain for them to ſtand out (for this is the lot of conquerours, their yoke is received, but they have not the hearts of them that ſtoop to it) ſo is it uſually with thoſe that become Chriſtians, they yield Chriſt onely <hi>fained obedience,</hi> they call him Lord, but his yoke is burthenſome to them, and they are farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch indeed, as they profeſſe themſelves to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As ſoon as they heare, they ſhall be obedient unto me.]</hi> That is, ſpeedily, as ſoon as they heare of any coming againſt them, without any more ado; ſo terrible the very name of David ſhould be unto them: but eſpecially is this verified in Chriſt, of whom David in this was a type; for the hearing of the word of Chriſt preached, is that whereby they are brought to ſtoop to his Sceptre, Rom. 10.17. <hi>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God:</hi> Epheſ. 1.13. <hi>In whom ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo truſted after you heared the word of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 46. <hi>Strangers ſhall fade away,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, either that the

glory and ſtrength of the heathens ſhould by little and little decay and waſte away, untill they came to ſubmit themſelves unto him; or elſe rather, that their hearts ſhould die, and fade; and faint away within them for fear; and therefore it follows, <hi>and they ſhall be afraid out of their cloſe places,</hi> though they be in places of never ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable ſtrength; even from theſe cloſe places, theſe fortified cities, towers and caſtles, they ſhall be no leſſe afraid, then if they were in ſome poor unwalled villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and this alſo may be not unfitly applyed to Chriſt, for it muſt be the fear of Gods wrath, the ſpirit of bondage, that muſt bring men in to ſubmit to Chriſts ſceptre: as long as a man doth hope that his own righteouſneſſe will ſhelter him, and can truſt in his prayers, his alms, &amp;c. in theſe <hi>cloſe places</hi> he will abide, and deſpiſe Chriſt: but if once he is afraid in his <hi>cloſe places,</hi> he ſeeth the weakneſſe and vanitie of theſe things, then he will come out of them, and diſclaim all hope in them, and ſubmit himſelf to Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And he ſhall be as the light of the morning, when the ſunne riſeth, even a morning without clouds,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, who ſo ruleth as is before ſaid, he ſhall reign proſperouſly, and ſtill encreaſe in glory; his glory ſhall be like the morning light, that ſhines more and more unto the perfect day, <hi>as the tender graſſe ſpringing out of the earth, by clear ſhining after rain,</hi> that is, the glory of his kingdome ſhall be great, and ſhall dayly encreaſe like the graſſe, that hath ſeaſonably the moiſtening rain, and warming ſunne to make it ſprout up and grow.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>But the ſonnes of Belial, ſhall be all of them as thorns thrust away,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, all prophane, graceleſſe, and ſtubborn wretches, that will not ſtoop to Gods government, (and why theſe are called <hi>ſonnes of Belial,</hi> we may ſee in the note, Deut. 13.13.) becauſe <hi>they cannot be taken with hands,</hi> that is, they are intractable and incorrigible, there's no dealing with them in a gentle way, they will ſcratch and tear thoſe that offer to touch them, God will cut them up, and caſt them out, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them up to the inſtruments of his wrath, and ſo as thorns, <hi>they ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly burnt with fire, in the ſame place,</hi> that is, in the very place where they grew, or the place whither they are thruſt away: and ſo the meaning may be, either that they ſhall be utterly deſtroyed and conſumed here in this world, or that they ſhall be made the fewell of hell fire hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Theſe be the names of the mighty men whom David had.]</hi> His chief Colonels and Captains under Joab the Generall of all his forces, men renowned for their valour and admirable exploits, and ſuch as were great ſupporters to David in all his troubles, as it is expreſſed, 1. Chron. 11.10. <hi>Theſe alſo are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who ſtrengthened themſelves with him in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and with all Iſrael to make him king:</hi> It ſeems that thirty of them, were Captains of thouſands, over whom there were ſix Colonels, though the firſt three had ſome preheminence of place and honour above the ſecond three: happely three of them were Colonels, and the other three were Lievetenant Colonels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Tachmonite that ſate in the ſeat chief among the captains, (the ſame was Adino the Eznite) he lift up his ſpear againſt eight hundred, whom he ſlew at one

time.]</hi> In the 1. Chron. 11.11. this is expreſſed thus, <hi>Jaſhobeam an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains, he lift up his ſpear againſt three hundred, ſlain by him at one time:</hi> ſo that by comparing theſe two places together we may probably at leaſt conclude concerning this man, who was the firſt of Davids worthies: firſt, that his proper name was <hi>Adino,</hi> as is here expreſſed: ſecondly, that he was called the <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> from the countrey where he was born, or bred; <hi>the Tachmonite,</hi> or <hi>Hach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monite,</hi> from his parentage, being the ſonne of one <hi>Tachmoni,</hi> or <hi>Hachmoni;</hi> and <hi>Jahobeam</hi> from his place of honour, becauſe he ſat in the ſeat, as is here ſaid, to wit, as preſident of the counſel of warre among the captains, for <hi>Jaſhobeam</hi> or as it is in the margent of our bibles, <hi>Joſheb-baſſebet,</hi> doth indeed ſignifie, <hi>he that ſits in the chair:</hi> and ſeems therefore to be a name given in alluſion to his place of dignitie, as being the firſt of the firſt three colonels, <hi>the chief</hi> under Joab <hi>amongst the captains:</hi> and thirdly, whereas it is ſaid here, that there were <hi>eight hundred whom he ſlew at one time;</hi> but in 1. Chron. 11.11. there is mention but of <hi>three hundred ſlain by him at one time:</hi> for the reconciling of this ſeeming difference, it muſt be held, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there were eight hundred ſlain by him at one time, &amp; three hundred at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or elſe rather, (if both places relate one and the ſame fight) that he diſcomfited and put to flight eight hundred, whereof onely three hundred were ſlain outright by him, the reſt by others, which yet are here ſaid to be ſlain by him, becauſe it was by means of his routing them, and beating them down before them, that they were ſlain.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And after him was Eleazer the ſonne of Dodo the Ahohite,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, one of the poſterity of Ahoah a Benjamite, 1. Chron. 8.4. this was alſo <hi>one of the three mighty men with David,</hi> that is, one of Davids three mighty men, to wit, the ſecond of the firſt three, one of them that defied the Philiſtines, vanquiſhed and ſmote them <hi>when the men of Iſrael were gone away;</hi> that is, when they fled from before the Philiſtines; for ſo it is expreſſed, 1. Chron. 11.13, 14. where alſo ſome circumſtances of this exploit, are more particularly related, to wit, that it was <hi>at Paſdammim, and in a parcel of ground, full of barley,</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt the Philiſtines, the reſt of the people being ſled away, and ſlow them there, ſo that at laſt <hi>the people returned to the ſpoil of the enemy,</hi> as it follows here in the next verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And his hand clave unto the ſword.]</hi> That is, when he had done ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Philiſtines he was not able to let go his ſword, or take his hand away from it; whether becauſe his hand was as it were glued with bloud to the hilt of his ſword, or becauſe the nerves and ſinews of his hand were ſo benummed with graſping it ſo hard, and holding it ſo long, that he could not take it off.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And after him was Shammah.]</hi> This was the third worthy of the firſt three: in the 1. Chron. 11. this Shammah is not mentioned, but as is above noted, the very ſame exploit is there aſcribed to Eleazar, which is here aſcribed to Shammah, to wit, that he alone defended a field of corn againſt a troop of Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and rooted, and ſlew them, when his men runne away from him, onely this is ſaid to have been done in <hi>a piece of ground full of lentiles;</hi> that by Eleazar <hi>in a parcel of ground full of barley:</hi> it is therefore probably conceived by Interpretours, that this exploit againſt the Philiſtines, was joyntly performed by both theſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains at one and the ſame time, and therefore it is ſaid, 1. Chron. 11.14. that they
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:42229:227"/>
ſet themſelves in the midſt of that parcel of ground, and delivered it, and ſlew the Philiſtines, and that there being both barley and lentiles in the ſame field, Eleazar kept the Philiſtines from the barley field, and Shammah from that part that had the lentiles.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time,</hi> &amp;c.] There is nothing in the text whereby we can certainly conclude, who theſe three worthies were that fetched water from the well of Bethlehem for David: ſome think that they were three of thoſe thirty named in the latter part of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; others, that they were the three colonells in the ſecond rank, or Lieuetenant colonells: but the moſt generall opinion of Expoſitours is, that they were the firſt three immediately before mentioned, to wit, Adino the Tachmonite, Eleazer, and Shammah, which ſeems the more probable, becauſe the 1. Chron. 11, 19. this paſſage is ſhut up with this clauſe: <hi>theſe things did theſe three mightiest.</hi> Before we are told what they did ſeverally, here an exploit is added which they did all joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and if it be ſo, then theſe firſt words, <hi>and the three of the thirty chief went down,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be thus underſtood, that the three chief of the thirty, or colonells and commanders of the thirty, that is over the thirty, went down and came to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 15. <hi>Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem,</hi> &amp;c.] Though David were happely at preſent diſtreſſed for want of water, yet he ſpake not theſe words, as deſiring to ſtirre up any of his ſouldiers to fetch it for him, but occaſionally to ſhew how precious a draught of that water would be in that his diſtreſſe, as if he ſhould have ſaid, what would one give now for a draught of the water of the well of Bethlehem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And the three mightie men brake through the host of the Philiſtines,</hi> &amp;c.] Though they knew there was at that time a <hi>gariſon of the Philiſtines in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> as is before noted, verſ. 14. and that there was a band of the Philiſtines that lay in the valley of Rephaim, verſ. 13. in the way as they were to go to Bethlehem: yet no ſooner did David ſeem to wiſh for a draught of the water of the well of Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem, but thoſe three reſolved to ſatisfie his deſire, and ſo breaking through the hoſt of the Philiſtines, to wit, which lay in the valley of Rephaim, they came to Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem, and in deſpite of the gariſon there, drew of that water, and brought it unto David.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nevertheleſſe he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord.]</hi> That is, as out of reſpect to God, and to teſtifie how farre he was from deſiring to to expoſe ſo raſhly the lives of his Captains, for ſatisfying of his deſire to drink of this water, he poured it out upon the ground, though it ſeems at that time they wanted water, and therefore that might be thought an act of folly, to caſt away wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter procured with ſo much danger; it is ſaid, he did it <hi>unto the Lord,</hi> that is, out of a religious reſpect, to make known how farre he was from deſiring to hazard their lives to pleaſe his appetite.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Abiſhai the brother of Joab, the ſonne of Zeruiah, was chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong three.]</hi> That is, among the ſecond three.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he lift up his ſpear againſt three hundred, and ſlew them,</hi> &amp;c.] Other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant acts he did beſides, as that when he went with David into the midſt of Sauls

camp, 1. Sam. 26.6. <hi>Who will go down with me to Saul, to the camp, and Abiſhai ſaid, I will go down with thee:</hi> 2. Sam. 21.16, 17. <hi>And Iſhbi-benob, which was of the ſonnes of the giant, (the weight of whoſe ſpear weighed three hundred ſhekels of braſſe in weight, he being girded with a new ſword, thought to have ſlain Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. But Abiſhai the ſonne of Zeruiah ſuccoured him, and ſmote the Philiſtine, and killed him:</hi> but here that onely is recorded, which was not mentioned before.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>He went down alſo, and ſlew a lion in the midſt of a pit in time of ſnow.]</hi> His valour in ſlaying the lion, is here amplified by two circumſtances: firſt, that it was in the midſt of a pit, where the room was ſtrait, and where he knew beforehand he muſt either kill or be killed: and ſecondly, that it was in the ſnow-time, when lions are moſt fierce by reaſon, then they want there prey, the ſheep and cattel being uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhut up in ſuch hard weather.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And he ſlew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a ſpear in his hand,</hi> &amp;c.] 1. Chron. 11.23. it is expreſſed that he was <hi>a man of great ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, five cubits high, and that his ſpear was like a weavers beam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Theſe things did Benaiah the ſonne of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighty men.]</hi> That is, among the ſecond three; who was the third of the ſecond three, is not here expreſſed, ſome reckon one of thoſe worthies menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, chap, 21.18. &amp;c. Sibbechai, Elhanan, and Jonathan: others Aſahel the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Joab, verſ. 24. and that eſpecially, becauſe there are thirty mentioned beſides him, in the following verſes, which ſeems to me moſt probable, yet nothing can be certainly concluded upon ſuch uncertain grounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirty and ſeven in all.]</hi> There are here in this catalogue, onely thirty one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to which if we joyn the five worthies, or colonells mentioned in the former part of the chapter, that makes but thirty ſix; and therefore to make up this number of thirty ſeven; either Joab muſt be comprehended, as being generall of all the kings forces; or elſe the third of the ſecond three worthies, not being here expreſſed by name.</p>

In 1. Chron. 27.1. &amp;c. it is expreſſely ſaid, that for every ſeverall moneth there were ſeverall bands, of four and twenty thouſand, that did in their courſes attend upon the king, and hence is this expreſſion, <hi>captain of the hoſt which was with him:</hi> and the rather happely is this clauſe added, becauſe the hoſt which now attended in Jeruſalem upon the king, was to go out with Joab to attend him in this ſervice of numbring the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Go now through all the tribes of Iſrael, from Dan even to Beer-ſheba, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ye the people,</hi> &amp;c.] He enjoynes them to number the people, that is, all that were fit for warre, verſ. 9. <hi>and there were in Iſrael eight hundred thouſand valiant men that drew the ſword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thouſand men:</hi> and gives no other reaſon but this, <hi>that I may know the number of the people:</hi> and herein the ſin of David is intimated, to wit, that he did it cauſeleſſely, merely out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie and pride, and carnall confidence in the multitude and ſtrength of his people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>But why doth my Lord the king delight in this thing?]</hi> That is, why ſhould this be done, there being no other cauſe for it, onely to ſatisfie thy curioſitie, and to delight thy ſelf therein? In 1. Chron. 21.3. there are other reaſons added, which Joab uſed alſo to diſſwade the king from this his purpoſe, of numbring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as, <hi>are they not all my lords ſervants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cauſe of treſpaſſe to Iſrael?</hi> concerning which, ſee the note there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Notwithſtanding, the kings word prevailed against Joab, and againſt the captains of the hoſt,</hi> &amp;c.] Though not Joab onely, but the captains alſo with him, did what they could to diſſwade David; yet David reſolved it ſhould be ſo, and ſo it was done, though he could not over-ballance them with reaſons, yet his word prevailed, he had ſaid it ſhould be ſo, and therefore it muſt be: it is indeed a very diſputeable queſtion, whether Joab and the other captains did well in yielding to David for the numbring of the people. Some hold that they did well therein, and that becauſe when Princes enjoyn that which is not in it ſelf ſinfull (as doubtleſſe it was not evil in it ſelf to number the people) the ſubject then is bound to obey: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hold that Joab did ſinne in obeying the kings command herein: firſt, becauſe Joab perceived plainly, that David commanded this cauſeleſſely, and onely to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his vain glorious humour; and ſo as the commanding of this with ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention made it ſinfull in David, ſo the obeying of this command in Joab, when he knew the kings intention was evil, could not be warrantable: and ſecondly, becauſe it appears that Joab did it againſt conſcience (for ſo it is ſaid, 1. Chron. 21.6. <hi>the kings word was abominable to Joab</hi>) yea, and when he did it, his mind gave him it ſeems, that there would come ſome judgement upon the kingdome for it: <hi>why doth my lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>require this thing:</hi> and indeed in theſe regards, this laſt opinion ſeems to be the moſt probable. Joabs conſcience was againſt this unneceſſary num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the people, the rather happely, becauſe it was like to be ſome way charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and burdenſome to the people: but he had once angered David before, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt his command in the death of Abſalom, and he was loth to hazard his diſpleaſure again.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And came to the ſtrong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, and of the Canaanites.]</hi> That is, all the cities formerly poſſeſſed by thoſe nations, or where ſome remainders of thoſe nations, did ſtill live mixed among the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And there were in Iſrael eight hundred thouſand valiant men that drew the ſword.]</hi> Hereby it is evident, that onely thoſe men were numbred, that were of years and of abilitie of body to bear arms, the reaſon whereof is given, 1. Chron. 27.23. <hi>But David took not the number from twenty years old and under, becauſe the Lord had ſaid, he would encreaſe Iſrael like the ſtarres in the heavens;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the intention of David, was chiefly, to know the ſtrength of his kingdome; for that was it wherein his heart was exalted; he deſired to know how many armed men fit for warre, he was able, if need required, to bring into the field; beſides, though it be ſaid in generall, that in Iſrael, that is, in the tribes of Iſrael conſidered apart from Judah, <hi>there were eight hundred thouſand valiant men;</hi> yet we muſt know that the tribes of Levi and Benjamin were not included in this number; for ſo it is expreſſed, 1. Chron. 21.6. <hi>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not amongſt them: for the kings word was abominable to Joab,</hi> concerning which, ſee the note in that place; but why is it ſaid, 1. Chron. 21.5. that there were found in Iſrael, eleven hundred thouſand, and here it is ſaid that there were found of them, but eight hundred thouſand? I anſwer, that in the Chronicles it is likely that the ordinary companies of the trained bands are included, which in their turns did every moneth attend in Jeruſalem: which are here omitted, becauſe their names were alwayes kept enrolled, and therefore there was no need now to take the account of them: but was there then three hundred thouſand of them? I anſwer, there were two hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eighty and eight thouſand of them, (for there were four and twenty thouſand which ſerved every moneth; and twelve times four and twenty thouſand, make two hundred eighty and eight thouſand) to which if you adde their captains over thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and hundreds, and other officers of the bands, they might well make up three hundred thouſand; I know that many Expoſitours do in another manner reconcile theſe two places, and that not improbably, to wit, that in the Chronicles we have the number of all that were numbred by Joab and the captains, which were eleven hundred thouſand, but that here we have the number that Joab gave up to David, which was but eight hundred thouſand, and that becauſe whileſt he was making up the account out of there ſeverall papers, which he was to give in to the king, the plague was begun in Jeruſalem, and that hereupon he brake off in diſcontent, and ſo three hundred thouſand were left out in the account which was by Joab carried in
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42229:229"/>
to David, and hence they ſay is that, 1. Chron. 27.24. <hi>Joab the ſonne of Zeruiah began to number, but he finiſhed it not, becauſe there fell wrath againſt Iſrael for it, neither was the number put in the account of the Chronicles of king David;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is expreſſely ſaid, 1. Chr. 21.5. that Joab gave up to David the ſumme of eleven hundred thouſand of Iſrael; and the ſeries of the hiſtory ſeems plainly to imply, that Joab gave up the ſum of the people before the plague begun, therefore I conceive the firſt anſwer is far the moſt probable. As for that place, 1. Chr. 27.24. ſee the note there</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the men of Judah were five hundred thouſand men.]</hi> Both in regard of the dignity of this tribe, and the multitudes of their people; the number of this tribe was given in apart by it ſelf. In 1. Chron. 25.5. it is ſaid there were of Judah four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy thouſand, here it is ſaid there were of Judah five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; ſo that here are reckoned of Judah thirty thouſand more then are reckoned there, to which there are two ſolutions given by Expoſitours; the firſt is, that the thirty companies under the command of the thirty worthies mentioned in the latter end of the former chapter (which might be all of Judah) are reckoned here, but left out in the Chronicles: the other is, that here is ſet down the totall number of the men of Judah which was taken before the plague, but in the Chronicles thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of theſe are left out, becauſe ſo many of them were dead of the plague, but for the reaſon mentioned in the former note, I rather approve of the firſt of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Davids heart ſmote him after he had numbered the people.]</hi> Expoſitours do generally hold, that this was done the very night before the Prophet Gad was ſent unto him, verſ. 11. God wakening his conſcience by the immediate motion of his ſpirit; for though in the Chronicles Gods puniſhing the people is mentioned before Davids repentance, yet it is evident, that firſt Davids heart ſmote him, and then afterwards when he had choſen three dayes peſtilence, the peſtilence was ſent amongſt them: and this was the plague wherewith God ſmote Iſrael, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Davids ſinne, but yet according to our tranſlation, wherein the following verſe is rendred, not as it is ordinarily in other tranſlations: <hi>And when David was up in the morning,</hi> &amp;c. but, <hi>for when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came unto the Prophet Gad,</hi> &amp;c. methinks it cannot be otherwiſe taken, but that when David was up the next morning after the number of the people was given unto him by Joab; the Prophet Gad was ſent unto him by the Lord to make known his ſinne, and how he intended to puniſh him for it, and that hereupon Davids heart ſmote him, and he confeſſed his ſinne to the Lord, and begged pardon of him: as is here ſaid, for to what elſe can that particle (<hi>for</hi>) have reference, but to make known how Davids heart came to be touched with remorſe for his numbring of the people, to wit, that the Prophet Gad was ſent unto him with the following meſſage, and that thereupon his heart ſmote him, and he humbled himſelf before God, as is here expreſſed; but however, evident it is, that all the while that Joab and the captains were numbring the people, which was verſ. 8. <hi>Nine moneths, and twenty dayes,</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid continued in his ſinne without any effectuall check of conſcience for it; which is indeed very obſervable.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I offer thee three things, chooſe thee one of them,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the Lord knew better then David, which was the leaſt grievous of the three puniſhments, he meant to propound to him, and accordingly had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſend the peſtilence amongſt them; yet did he think fit to tender him warre,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:42229:229"/>
and famine, and peſtilence, willing him to chooſe with which of them he would be ſcourged; firſt, becauſe when the peſtilence was ſent amongſt them the very ſcourge which he had choſen, hereby David might plainly ſee, that it was ſent of God, and that for the puniſhment of his ſinne: ſecondly, becauſe this was uſefull to humble David the more by letting him ſee the hainouſneſſe of his ſinne, in the ſharp puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God might juſtly have laid upon him, as a father that brings forth three or four rods, ſome greater then other, though he means to uſe but one of them, and happely the leaſt, doth thereby the more ſcare his child, and humble him with the fear of his anger, ſo did the Lord deal herein with David: thirdly, becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he meant to diſcover his kindneſſe, and mercy to David, who though he might have inflicted what puniſhment he pleaſed himſelf, not onely of theſe three, but of a thouſand more, yet ſuch was his gentleneſſe and goodneſſe to David, that of theſe three he would let him chooſe which he had rather ſuffer: and fourthly, becauſe he would hereby make it more manifeſt, that the determination of our wills by Gods decree, doth no way deprive us of the freedome of our wills, as we ſee in David, who was left freely to chooſe either of theſe puniſhments propounded, and yet choſe (and indeed could not but chooſe) that which God had decreed on.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Shall ſeven years of famine come unto thee in thy land?]</hi> Three years of famine are onely ſpoken of, in 1. Chron. 21.11, 12. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Chooſe thee, Either three years famine, or,</hi> &amp;c. therefore we muſt underſtand, that here thoſe years of famine mentioned, chap. 21. are alſo included, becauſe of this plague, would have been much aggravated by this, that having had lately three years of famine, they ſhould now in the fourth yeare be doomed to three years famine more: as if the Prophet had ſaid, three years of famine the land hath already endured, becauſe of Sauls ſinne againſt the Gibeonites, and this is now the fourth yeare wherein the Lord hath manifeſted that his wrath is appeaſed by ſending ſeaſonable ſhowers of rain, but being now again offended by this thy ſinne he propounds unto thee three years famine more, ſhall the famine you are ſcarce yet rid of begin a new, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of ſeven years; and theſe are thoſe three years of famine mentioned, 1. Chron, 21.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or that there be three dayes pestilence in thy land?]</hi> In 1. Chron. 21.12. <hi>or three dayes the ſword of the Lord, even the peſtilence in the land, and the Angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Iſrael.</hi> It was not therefore an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry peſtilence cauſed by the diſtemper of the air, and other naturall cauſes which was now propounded to David, but a peſtilence by the immediate ſtroke of an Angel which is alſo evident indeed by this, that in three dayes ſpace it went throughout all the coaſts of Iſrael, and having continued three dayes did then preſently ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>I am in a great ſtrait: let us fall now into the hand of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] The famine was to continue ſeverall years, the ſword to deſtroy ſeverall moneths, and the peſtilence to laſt onely three dayes, yet David was in a ſtrait which he ſhould chooſe, and that becauſe they were all ſore judgements, and David knew well that the peſtilence might deſtroy as many in three dayes, as the ſword in three moneths, or the famine in three years: but at laſt he choſe the peſtilence, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would rather fall into the hands of God then men, <hi>Let us fall,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>now into the hand of the Lord;</hi> for though the ſword and famine are ſent by God, yet in them he uſeth other inſtruments beſides, as men in warre, and other devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42229:230"/>
creatures in famine, and beſides, in the peſtilence we depend more immediately upon the Lord for help, whereas in warre and famine our help depends very much upon the mercies of men; and again, uſually when the Lord puniſheth by men, he ſuffers them to deal more ſeverely and cruelly, then himſelf is wont to deal with them when he takes them into his own hand, and this was the main cauſe why David choſe the peſtilence; yet withall his charitie alſo was herein remarkable, that he choſe ſuch a calamitie as would ſpare the Prince no more then the people; whereas in warre he might have got into ſome ſtrong fort, and in famine might have ſtored up proviſion for himſelf, and ſo have hoped to be free.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>So the Lord ſent a pestilence upon Iſrael, from the morning even to the time appointed,]</hi> That is, from the morning when Gad came to David, unto the third day, verſ. 11. <hi>For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came unto the Prophet Gad,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Gad came and told it David,</hi> &amp;c. all which day the plague ſhould have continued, even the full term of three dayes, but then the Lord repented, and ſtayed the hand of the deſtroying Angel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there died of the people from Dan to Beerſheba, ſeventy thouſand men.]</hi> To wit, beſides women and children; or elſe, under this word men, women are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo included, as in other places, however, thus was David puniſhed in that wherein he had ſinned, his mind was lifted up becauſe of the number of his people, and now their numbers are diminiſhed and empaired.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And when the Angel ſtretched out his hand upon Jeruſalem to deſtroy it, the Lord repented him</hi> &amp;c.] That is, on the third day, when after the ſlaughter of many thouſands in the other parts of the kingdome, the plague was begun in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem too; the Lord repented him of the evil which he had threatned, and ſo before the plague had continued full three dayes, the Lord commanded the Angel to ſtay his hand: evident indeed it is, that the charge given to the Angel to ſtay his hand, was not till David and the Elders had humbled themſelves, upon their ſeeing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel with a drawn ſword, and had offered up a ſacrifice, as God had enjoyned, for ſo it is ſaid, verſ. 17. that when David prayed, <hi>he ſaw the Angel that ſmote the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and verſ. 25. <hi>David built there an altar unto the Lord.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So the Lord was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed;</hi> onely firſt herein generall this is prefixed, that the Lord repented him, and commanded the Angel to ſtay his hand, and then afterwards it is expreſſed how the Lord was wonne to do this, to wit, by the prayers and ſacrifices which David offered unto him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And David ſpake unto the Lord, when he ſaw the Angel that ſmote the people.</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, with a drawn ſword in his hand and that not in a viſion, but in a viſible ſhape; for not onely David, but the Elders alſo that were with him, and Ornan, and his ſonnes are ſaid to have ſeen him, (for Araunah here, is there called Ornan) 1. Chron. 21.16. <hi>David ſaw the Angel of the Lord ſtand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn ſword in his hand:</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>And Ornan turned back and ſaw the Angel, and his four ſonnes with him, and they went and hid themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lo, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly: but theſe ſheep, what have they done?</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in that act of numbring the people, for which David had been told, that the peſtilence was ſent amongſt them, for ſo it is expreſſed in 1. Chron. 11.17. David knew well enough that there was too much ſinne amongſt the people,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42229:230"/>
to provoke God to deſtroy them, but he knew withall, that the preſent plague was ſent amongſt them for his ſinne in numbring the people, and that it was that did chiefly rend the bowels of David, that by his ſinne he had cauſed ſuch a ſlaughter to be made amongſt the people, which made him plead ſo earneſtly their innocence, in regard of this ſinne, and to ſtep in as it were betwixt the ſword of the Angel, and the poor people, <hi>Let thine hand I pray thee be againſt me, and against my fathers houſe;</hi> which may be meant either of his tendring himſelf alone, to be ſlain in ſtead of the people (for the whole houſe of his father would have ſuffered greatly in his death) or elſe as an expreſſion of his reall deſire, that he and his whole family ſhould be cut off, rather then that the people ſhould ſuffer as they did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Gad came that day to David, and ſaid unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the Lord, in the threſhing-floore of Araunah the Jebuſite.]</hi> That God by his Angel did ſend the Prophet Gad with this meſſage to David, is evident, verſ. 19. <hi>And David, according to the ſaying of Gad, went up as the Lord commanded,</hi> and 1. Chron. 21.18, <hi>Then the Angel of the Lord commanded Gad to ſay to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, that David ſhould go up and ſet up an altar,</hi> &amp;c. though David and the Elders of Iſrael had humbled themſelves in ſackcloth, and prayed unto the Lord, 1. Chron. 21.16, 17, 18. Yet for the ſtaying of the plague, the Lord would have beſides an altar reared, and ſacrifices offered thereon, which was doubtleſſe, to teach them that there was no way to obtain the pardon of their ſinne, and the removall of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent judgement, but by faith in that propitiatory ſacrifice which their promiſed Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was to offer up for them: but why was this altar appointed to be reared in the threſhing floore of Araunah the Jebuſite? I anſwer, firſt, to intimate the end of this ſacrifice, to wit, that it was to ſtay the plague, that it might go no further, there it was that the Angel appeared in a viſible ſhape, with a drawn ſword, 1. Chron. 21.15. <hi>The Angel of the Lord ſtood by the threſhing floore of Ornan the Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,</hi> thither therefore David was ſent to rear up an altar, and to offer ſacrifices: ſecondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe of Davids fear, the Lord having a gracious reſpect herein to the ſad condition of his poor ſervant, which we find expreſſed. 1. Chron. 21.29.30. <hi>The tabernacle of the Lord which Moſes made in the wilderneſſe, and the altar of tht burnt offerings, were at that ſeaſon in the high places at Gibeon. But David could not go before it to enquire of God; for he was afraid, becauſe of the ſword of the Angel of the Lord,</hi> that is, he durſt not give over interceding there, to go unto Gibeon, for fear of the ſlaughter that might be made in the interim, by the ſword of the Angel amongſt the inhabitants of Jeruſalem; or elſe he was ſo weakened with the terrour of ſeeing the Angel with a drawn ſword, that he was not able to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when he could not go to Gibeon, what place was then ſitter to reare an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in, then that where the Angel appeared with a drawn ſword? thirdly, to ſignifie the calling of the Gentiles; for Araunah being of the ſtock of the Jebuſites, though doubtleſſe at preſent a proſelite, that is, one that was converted to the faith of Iſrael, the Lords appointing David to rear an altar in his threſhing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>floore, did notably ſhadow forth, that the day ſhould come when God would dwell amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and be worſhipped by them: and fourthly, becauſe God had determined in this very place to have the Temple built, as is evident, 2. Chron. 3.1. <hi>Then Solomon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build the houſe of the Lord in Jeruſalem, in mount Moriah, where the
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:42229:231"/>
Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared, in the threſhing floore of Ornan the Jebuſite:</hi> and ſo the Lord would have this place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated as it were, and endeared to the people, by the ſacrifice that procured ſo great a bleſſing for them, as was the ſtaying of this raging peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Behold, here be oxen for burnt ſacrifices, and threſhing inſtruments, and other inſtruments of the oxen for wood.]</hi> In 1. Chron. 21.23. there is added, that he offered him alſo his wheat for a meat-offering: <hi>Lo, I will give thee the oxen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for burnt-offerings, and the threſhing inſtruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering, I give it all;</hi> partly becauſe of the terrour he was ſtricken into, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Angel with the drawn ſword (for as it is noted before, from 1. Chron. 21.20, both he and his ſonnes had ſeen the Angel, <hi>and hid themſelves</hi>) and partly, becauſe he was told that the altar and ſacrifices intended, were for the removing of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy judgement that lay now upon the people; in ſtead of ſelling, he proffered to give unto David, not the threſhing floore onely, but the oxen alſo, the threſhing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wheat and all, not caring how much he gave for ſo good a uſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>All theſe things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.]</hi> The moſt Expoſitours do hereupon inferre, that this Araunah had been king of the Jebuſites, and embracing the faith of Iſrael, was content to live as a private man, and to let David reigne as king in Jeruſalem, and indeed in the Hebrew it is, <hi>All theſe things did Araunah a king, give unto the king;</hi> but this ground methinks is not ſufficient to warrant this conceit, rather I conceive this expreſſion is uſed by way of extolling the bounty of Araunah, that he did herein as it were, match David the king in bounty, &amp; carried himſelf more like a king then a private ſubject, in this his princely bounty.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the king ſaid unto Araunah, Nay, but I will ſurely buy it of thee at a price,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive that David would needs give the full price for theſe things, becauſe he would not take away that which was anothers, to give unto God; as knowing well that ſometimes a kings requeſt, is in effect a command, &amp; that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do often give what they would not part with, but that they dare not but give it: but becauſe David might well ſee that Araunah offered theſe thing freely, it is better ſaid by others, that this was from the ingenuity of David, becauſe he was not willing to ſerve God coſt-free.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So David bought the threſhing-floore, and the oxen, for fifty ſhekels of ſilver.]</hi> 1. Chron. 11.25. It is ſaid, <hi>that David gave to Ornan for the place, ſix hundred ſhekels of gold by weight,</hi> which ſeeming difference is thus reconciled, to wit, that he bought the threſning-floore, and the oxen, as here, for fifty ſhekels of ſilver, but for the whole place, and the ground, with the houſes, where afterward the Temple was built, he gave ſix hundred ſhekels of gold.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>So the Lord was intreated for the land, and the plague was ſtayed from Iſrael.]</hi> And this the Lord teſtified by ſending fire from heaven to conſume the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as is expreſſed, 1. Chron. 21.26 <hi>and he anſwered him from heaven by fire upon the altar</hi> which muſt be meant onely of burning the burnt offerings; for the ſacrifices of peace offerings were not burnt upon the altar, but were to be eaten as a holy feaſt, ſo that it ſeems the burnt-offerings were firſt offered on the altar, which were miraculouſly conſumed by fire from heaven, and then afterwards the peace-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were offered upon the ſame altar.</p>

But now who were the holy Ghoſts pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in writing theſe books, we cannot determine; onely that which ſome hold, ſeems the moſt probable, namely, that they were written piece-meals by ſeverall Prophets ſucceſſively in their ſeverall ages, and then afterward collected &amp; compacted into one continued hiſtory, by ſome holy man of God, who was guided therein by the ſpirit of God; and that Firſt, becauſe it is manifeſt that many paſſages in theſe books were formerly recorded by Nathan, Ahijah, and Iddo, 2. Chron. 9.29. Secondly, becauſe it is alſo evident that the greateſt part of the 18, 19, and 20. chapters of the ſecond book of the Kings, was taken out of the prophecy of Iſaiah, as we may ſee Iſa. 36.1. &amp;c. And thirdly, becauſe the ſtory of Zedekiah, which we have in the latter end of the ſecond book of the kings, ſeems to have been taken almoſt word for word out of the latter end of the prophecie of Jeremiah. As for the dependance of this hiſtory upon that which went before in the end of the ſecond book of Samuel, though the laſt thing there recorded be the ſtaying of the peſtilence, ſent for Davids ſinne in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the people, by his rearing of an altar in the threſhing floore of Araunah, and offering ſacrifices thereon as God had commanded; yet we muſt know that Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs inſurrection, which is the next thing here recorded, did not follow immediately upon that, but many other things intervened between, which are recorded in the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:42229:232"/>
eight laſt chapters of the firſt book of Chronicles; for after the Lord had at that time it ſeems revealed to him that the Temple ſhould be built by his ſonne Solomon, in that very place where now he had reared an altar in the threſhing floore of Arau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, 1. He made great preparations of all materialls requiſite for that work, and ſet workmen at work about them, to make them ready for the building. 2. He ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the courſes of the Prieſts and Levites for their attendance upon their ſeverall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the Temple. 3. He made known in a publick aſſembly of the Princes and Rulers of the people, what the Lords pleaſure was, for Solomons ſucceeding him in the throne, and encouraged Solomon to build the Temple, and perſwaded the Princes and people to aſſiſt him therein, giving Solomon withall a pattern in writing, how all things were to be made, according as God had revealed it to him. And 4. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other aſſembly he perſwaded the people to contribute willingly to the building of the Temple, which accordingly they did. It is evident, I ſay, that all theſe things record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the eight laſt chapters of the firſt of Chronicles were done whileſt David was able to go abroad (for it is ſaid, 1. Chron. 28.2. that he <hi>ſtood up upon his feet</hi> in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Princes and Rulers, and ſpake unto them) and therefore they were done before this uſurpation of Adonijah, when David lay bedrid, and not able to ſtirre, as it is ſaid here, and that to ſhew that hereupon Adonijah took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of making himſelf king; <hi>King David was old, and ſtricken in years;</hi> yea, ſo weak he was, that lying bedrid <hi>they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat,</hi> and ſo thereupon verſ. 5, <hi>Adonijah the ſonne of Haggith exalted himſelf, ſaying, I will be king.</hi> It is much indeed that David ſhould be ſo farre ſpent with age before his death; for though this were a little before his death, he lived in all but threeſcore and ten years. 2. Sam. 5.4. <hi>David was thirty years old when he began to reigne, and he reigned fourty years;</hi> and we ſee in theſe dayes that many at theſe years are farre from this weakneſſe; but yet conſidering his many labours, warres, troubles, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and ſorrows, which do uſually much empair the ſtrength of man, <hi>A broken ſpirit,</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>drieth the bones,</hi> Prov. 17.22. it is no wonder though Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid in his old age ſunk apace, and was ſooner decrepite and bed-rid then other men.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Wherefore his ſervants ſaid unto him, Let there be ſought for my Lord the king a young virgin,</hi> &amp;c.] David had at this time many wives &amp; concubines, but theſe were all it ſeems well in years, and therefore his ſervants the Phyſitians adviſed that ſome well-complexioned young virgin ſhould be ſought out for him, to ſtand before him, to cheriſh him, and to lie in his boſome, as judging the heat of youth fitteſt to cauſe heat in his cold body, eſpecially where it had not been empaired by breeding and bearing of children, which made them adviſe that ſhe ſhould not onely be young, but a virgin too. Now though there be no mention here made of Davids taking ſuch an one to be his wife or concubine, but onely of his taking her to lie in his boſome in a medicinall way, yet that this was ſuppoſed and intended, ſeverall reaſons may induce us to think. 1. Becauſe it is no way probable that David would have yielded to ſuch a way of curing the coldneſſe of his body, had ſhe not been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken under the name of a wife or concubine, which was generally eſteemed lawfull in thoſe dayes; the other way would have been ſo ridiculous and ſcandalous, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought that David would ever have given his conſent to it. 2. Becauſe it is noted ver. 4. as an evidence of the great decay of his body, that though ſhe lay in
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42229:232"/>
his boſome, yet <hi>he knew her not:</hi> which doth clearly enough imply that ſhe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſuch a conjugall way, that he might lawfully have known her, had he not been diſabled by that extreme weakneſſe which lay now upon him: and thirdly, becauſe, had not Abiſhag been taken as Davids wife or concubine, Solomon would never have ſuſpected as he did, chap. 2.22, that Adonijah in ſeeking to take Abiſhag to wife after his fathers death, had a plot thereby to get away the kingdome from him: to have married the wife of the deceaſed king, might have advanced his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome way amongſt the people, but had Abiſhag been taken onely to attend on the king in his weakneſſe, or to lie in his boſome onely in a phyſicall way, there would have been no colour to think, that when he ſhould again lay claim to the crown, his marriage with ſuch an one would have added the leaſt ſtrength to his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and therefore it was ſurely the meaning of Davids Phyſicians, that a young wife or concubine ſhould be provided for the king to lie in his boſome; which may be one reaſon too why they adviſed ſhe ſhould be a virgin, as having reſpect therein to the honour of the king: as for that which is alſo ſaid of her attendance upon him, <hi>And let her ſtand before the king, and let her cheriſh him,</hi> this I conceive the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans added, partly becauſe they would ſhew that beſides the principall end they aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in this counſel they gave, ſuch a young wife might be a great comfort and help to him in his weakneſſe, by waiting on him, and miniſtring unto him ſuch things as he had need of; and partly becauſe the performance of theſe ſervices might mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduce to the end principally intended, in as much as they might gain upon the affections of David, and ſo his heart cleaving to her, he might take the more delight in her lying in his boſome, the means appointed for the cheriſhing of his cold body.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>So they ſought for a fair damoſel throughout all the coaſts of Iſrael, and found Abiſhag a Shunammite.]</hi> That is, of Shunem, a city in the tribe of Iſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char, Joſh. 19.18. where afterward dwelt that honourable matron, that made ſo much of the prophet Eliſha, 2. Kings 4.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>But the king knew her not.]</hi> This is expreſſely noted: firſt, as a clear evidence of the kings continuing weakneſſe: and ſecondly, to ſhew the reaſon why Adonijah did after his fathers death deſire to have this Abiſhag to wife, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his father had never known her, which made him think that he might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marry her, though ſhe had been his fathers wife, or concubine.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Then Adonijah the ſonne of Haggith exalted himſelf, ſaying, I will be king.]</hi> It was now doubtleſſe generally known in the court, that David by Gods appointment, had given order that his ſonne Solomon ſhould ſucceed him in the throne of Iſrael; for we ſee, 1. Chron. 28.5, &amp;c. before he was bedrid, in a ſolemn aſſembly of all the princes and captains of Iſrael, he did openly make known both Gods command and his purpoſe in this particular: now Adonijah, being the eldeſt of Davids ſonnes then living, grudging at this, reſolved to prevent it, and to make himſelf king before his fathers death; for beſides that Solomon was young and born of a mother formerly attainted with adultery, his father was now bedrid and near his end, which would be a great advantage, becauſe he would not be able to ſtirre to make head againſt him, and a fair pretence, becauſe his father could not live long, and in that weakneſſe he could not do the work of a king; and then beſides, Joab that invincible and feared captain, who was the chief cauſe of Abſaloms overthrow,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42229:233"/>
was now diſcontented, and was eaſily drawn unto his party; in all which reſpects, however Abſalom had ſped ill in the like attempt, he made no queſtion but he ſhould carry the matter without reſiſtance, and therefore he <hi>exalted himſelf, ſaying, I will be king,</hi> that is, though he had no juſt title neither from God nor man, yet he reſolved that he would be king, and to that end he preſently made a conſpiracie to effect what he had reſolved; making no conſcience of cruſhing his fathers heart with ſorrow, even then when he lay already in ſuch a ſad &amp; weak condition; but thus ſtill God made good that, 2. Sam. 12.11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I will raiſe up evil againſt thee out of thine own houſe, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, &amp; he ſhall lie with thy wives in the ſight of this ſunne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he prepared him chariots and horſemen, and fifty men to runne before him.]</hi> As Abſalom his brother had formerly done; concerning which, ſee the note, 2. Sam. 15.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And his father had not diſpleaſed him at any time, in ſaying, Why haſt thou done ſo?]</hi> This is noted; firſt, becauſe this was a great encouragement to Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah; he preſumed upon his fathers indulgence; this it was that had marred him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and this it was that did now embolden him to do what he did: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe this circumſtance did render this fact of his farre the more odious, that he could deal ſo lewdly with a father that had loved him ſo dearly, and had been ſo tender over him as David had been.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he alſo was a very goodly man.]</hi> It is queſtionable what this word (<hi>alſo</hi>) hath relation to; ſome conceive that it hath reference onely to that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, concerning Davids fondneſſe over Adonijah, to wit, that as that did embolden him to do what he did, ſo did this alſo, that he was a man of a goodly perſonage, and therefore, as himſelf judged, the fitter to ſway the ſceptre, and the more likely to find favour amongſt the people; and indeed that the goodlineſſe of his perſon is here mentioned as another advantage that was in probability likely to promote his deſigne, I make no queſtion: but yet this word (<hi>alſo</hi>) I conceive, hath reference to Abſalom too; for though there be no expreſſe mention of Abſalom in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, yet there was an intimation of him in the fifth verſe, where the very ſame words are uſed concerning Adonijahs pomp, that were formerly uſed concerning Abſaloms, <hi>He prepared chariots and horſemen, and fifty men to runne before him,</hi> which was as much in effect, as if it had been ſaid, as Abſalom when he intended to get the kingdome from his father, put himſelf upon an extraordinary exceſſive way of pomp, and ſtate, and princely attendance, thereby to get himſelf the name of a gallant prince, and ſo to ingratiate himſelf amongſt the common people, ſo did A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donijah too: and ſo in relation to this it follows here, <hi>And he alſo was a very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man,</hi> that is, as Abſalom was a proper handſome goodly man, 2. Sam. 14.25. and this was one of the main things that raiſed his ambitious thoughts to look after the crown, ſo it was with Adonijah too, <hi>He alſo was a very goodly man;</hi> and this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had ſome influence into this attempt of his to make himſelf king; firſt, becauſe this puffed him up with an high conceit of himſelf, as thinking that God had made him to be above others, and fitted him to ſit in the throne and to ſway the ſceptre of Iſrael: ſecondly, becauſe this was one of thoſe things that had made his father ſo extremely fond of him, and now he hoped it would prevail with him too: and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:42229:233"/>
thirdly, becauſe for this, he expected to find the more favour amongſt the people; ſee the note, 2. Sam. 14.25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his mother bare him after Abſalom.]</hi> That is, the next ſonne that David had after Abſalom was this Adonijah, by his wife Haggith; and ſo Abſalom being dead, he was Davids eldeſt ſonne, and to him therefore as the next heir, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he thought did of right belong.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah.]</hi> That is, the Cherethites and Pelethites, and others that were of Davids guard, and in their courſes attended upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Wherefore Nathan ſpake unto Bathſheba, the mother of Solomon, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.]</hi> By Nathan the Lord had made known to David his will concerning Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſucceeding him in the throne, 1. Chr. 22.8, 9. 2. Sam. 7.13. and therefore Nathan knowing this which Adonijah had done to be againſt the will and purpoſe of the Lord, and againſt that which David had appointed, was the forwarder to ſtirre and oppoſe himſelf againſt it; and to that end he went preſently to Bathſheba, (before ſhe, though the mother of Solomon, had heard any thing of that which Adonijah had done) and acquainting her with what he had heard, and that by way of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (to ſtartle her the more) <hi>Haſt thou not heard that Adonijah the ſonne of Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gith doth reigne?</hi> he ſets her on work to go to the king about it, as knowing that in regard of her affection to her ſonne, none would be more zealous in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then ſhe; and that in regard of Davids great affection to her, none was more like to prevail with him; onely for her encouragement he addes thoſe words, <hi>And David our Lord knows it not,</hi> thereby intimating that ſhe need not fear, but David when he came to know what was done, would ſoon take a courſe to ſuppreſſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donijah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Let me, I pray thee, give thee counſel, that thou mayeſt ſave thine own life,</hi> &amp;c.] To make Bathſheba the more willing to hearken to him, Nathan here tells her how deeply the buſineſſe concerned her, and that becauſe if Adonijah prevailed, ſhe might be ſure that he would never let Solomon her ſonne live, that was his rivall for the crown; nor her neither, whoſe hatred he would alwayes fear, becauſe of the wrong he had done her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Adonijah reigneth; and now my Lord the king, thou knowest it not.]</hi> This laſt clauſe Bathſheba addes, to let the king know that ſhe did not tell him of Adonijahs reigning, as blaming him for breaking his promiſe (for ſhe was fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he knew nothing of it) but onely to make known the inſufferable inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Adonijah, who durſt attempt ſuch a thing without his privity, and that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid might in time take ſome courſe to ſuppreſſe him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20, <hi>And thou, my Lord, O king, the eyes of all Iſrael are upon thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That David might not fear, leſt he ſhould not be able to oppoſe the faction of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah; Bathſheba ſeeks to aſſure him, that the people were generally enclined to yield to that which he ſhould determine herein, and did wait to ſee which of his ſonnes he would appoint to ſit in the throne after him, or rather that he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for Solomon, and make good what he had formerly declared concerning him, in a publick aſſembly of the Princes and Elders of the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>I and my ſonne Solomon ſhall be counted offenders.]</hi> That is, I and my

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>onne ſhall be charged for endeavouring to have gotten the kingdome from Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, to whom of right it did belong, and ſo for that ſhall ſuffer as offenders.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>While ſhe yet talked with the king, Nathan the Prophet alſo came in.]</hi> And ſo Bathſheba went out; for though that be not expreſſed here, yet it is evidently implyed, verſ. 28. where it is ſaid, that when Nathan had ſpoken his mind, David commanded that Bathſheba ſhould be called in again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>My Lord, O king, haſt thou ſaid, Adonijah ſhall reigne after me?</hi> &amp;c.] This he demands onely to intimate, that he verily believed, that what Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah had done, he had done without his allowance: firſt, becauſe David was not wont to reſolve any thing in ſuch weighty affairs, without conſulting with him: and ſecondly, becauſe he himſelf had brought that meſſage to him from God, concerning Solomons ſucceeding him in the throne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26, <hi>And thy ſervant Solomon, hath he not called.]</hi> Thus ſhe calls her ſonne, by way of endearing him to David, to wit, by intimating that he was willing to obey his father in all things, and ſought not to wreſt the kingdome away, before he was dead, as Adonijah did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And ſhe came into the kings preſence, and stood before the king.]</hi> And ſo Nathan went out again, as is alſo clearly implyed, verſ. 32. where it is ſaid, that when David had ſpoken what he had to ſay to Bathſheba, he gave order that Nathan ſhould be called in again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my ſoul out of all distreſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] In renewing his oath to Bathſheba, David mentions the Lords delivering him out of all diſtreſſe, as an engagement whereby he was bound to be carefull of doing what in Gods preſence he had ſworn he would do.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Let my lord king David live for ever.]</hi> This may be meant thus, Long mayeſt thou live here, and for ever in the world to come; but becauſe this was an ordinary form of ſpeech which they uſed to Princes in thoſe times, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Iſraelites, but alſo amongſt other nations, as we may ſee Neh. 2.3. where Nehemiah ſpake thus to Artaxerxes, <hi>Let the king live for ever;</hi> and Dan. 2.4. <hi>Then ſpake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever,</hi> and ſo in many other places of that Prophecy, therefore many hold with good probability, that the meaning of this phraſe of ſpeech, was onely to imply, that they deſired the long life of their king, and could be glad, if it might be ſo, that they might never looſe him: and this too Bathſheba might at preſent ſay, the rather, to imply, that ſhe deſired not her ſonne Solomon ſhould be preſently king, but rather that king David might live to enjoy it himſelf, many, and many years, but onely that after his deceaſe her ſonne might then ſucceed him in the throne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>Take with you the ſervants of your lord.]</hi> That is, my life-guard, to wit, the Cherethites and Pelethites, verſ. 38. and this David appointed, partly for their better ſafeguard, and partly by way of honouring Solomon, as their new an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed king.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And cauſe Solomon my ſonne to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.]</hi> A river on the weſt or ſouthweſt of Jeruſalem, which Hezekiah brought ſtreight down to the weſt ſide of the citie of David, 2. Chron. 32.30. and it is thought to be the ſame that is elſewhere called Siloe. Thither David would have Solomon
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:42229:234"/>
go to be anointed, either becauſe thence he might afterward enter the citie with the more pomp and ſolemnity; or elſe, becauſe it was not farre from En-rogel where Adonijah and his confederates were met, and ſo it ſerved the better for their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they ſhould heare the noiſe made at Solomons anointing; or elſe, that all men might perceive, that David had now before his death appointed him to be anointed king, in oppoſition to Adonijah, who had exalted himſelf to be king over Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>And the Cherethites, and the Pelethites,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, 2. Sam. 8.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And Zadok the prieſt took an horn of oyl out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.]</hi> Concerning this ceremony of anointing kings, ſee the notes, 1. Sam. 10.1. and 16.13. Doubtleſſe the tabernacle here ſpoken of, from whence Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok took an horn of oyl for the anointing of Solomon, was not the tabernacle of Moſes, which was yet in Gibeon, 1. Chron. 16.39. but that which David had ſet up for the ark, 2. Sam. 6.17. and much leſſe can we ſay, that it was of that holy oyl which was at firſt provided for the anointing of the prieſts, for it is expreſſely ſaid that no other uſe was to be made of that oyl, Exod. 30.32. <hi>Upon mans fleſh ſhall it not be poured;</hi> or that the horn of oyl wherewith David was at firſt anointed, was for ever after kept in the tabernacle, that ſo the ſucceeding kings might be anointed therewith, as ſome conceive, for there is no juſt ground for this conjecture; all that can be ſaid is this, that there being oyl kept in the tabernacle for ſeverall holy uſes, Zadok the prieſt took an horn of this oyl to anoint the king; the rather happely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the office of the Magiſtrate is indeed holy, and accordingly we ſee the ſeat of Juſtice is called the holy place, Eccleſ. 8.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>And the people piped with pipes, and rejoyced with great joy,</hi> &amp;c.] This exceeding great joy of the people at the inauguration of Solomon was, firſt, becauſe the people hoped, that by ſettling him in the throne to whom by Gods own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it did belong, and that whilſt David was yet living to maintain what was done, thoſe civil warres would be prevented, which by the faction that Adonijah had made amongſt the great ones, were like to have been kindled in the land: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to teſtifie their willing and chearfull ſubmiſſion to his government: but then thirdly, it was ſurely intended by the providence of God to ſhadow forth the great joy that ſhould accrew to Gods people by the kingdome of Chriſt, of whom Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was a notable type, when men ſhould come in willingly, and ſubmit to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; whence is that of the Prophet, Zach. 9.9. <hi>Rejoyce greatly, O daughter of Zion; ſhout O daughter of Jeruſalem; behold, thy king cometh unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>And while he yet ſpake, behold, Jonathan the ſonne of Abiathar the prieſt came,</hi> &amp;c.] This Jonathan was one of thoſe that lurked nigh to Jeruſalem as ſpies, when Abſalom rebelled againſt his father, that they might bring David word, upon every occaſion, of what was uſefull for him to know, 2. Sam. 16.36. but now it ſeems his father ſiding with Adonijah, he alſo took part with him, and ſo perhaps lay now as a ſpie at Jeruſalem, to bring Adonijah word of Davids proceedings. As for thoſe words of Adonijah to him, <hi>Thou art a valiant man, and bringeſt good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;</hi> ſee 2. Sam. 18.27.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>And Jonathan anſwered and ſaid to Adonijah, Verily our Lord king David hath made Solomon king.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, the tidings I bring are

farre from good tidings, for ſurely <hi>David hath made Solomon king:</hi> whether theſe be good tidings, or no, judge ye.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 47. <hi>The kings ſervants came to bleſſe our Lord king David,</hi> &amp;c,] That is, to congratulate with him the happie accompliſhment of that which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and David greatly deſired, to wit, the ſettling of Solomon in the throne, with the generall approbation and applauſe of the people; and by way of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the care he had taken hereby to ſettle the peace of the land; to deſire the Lord to give him much comfort, and the land much benefit, by this ſonne of his, whom God had appointed to ſucceed him in the throne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the king bowed himſelf upon the bed.]</hi> By way of adoration and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God: ſee the like, Gen. 47.31.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 50. <hi>And caught hold on the horns of the altar.]</hi> Either that which David had built, or that in Gibeon, where the tabernacle now was, 1. Chron. 21.29. and this he did to ſecure himſelf from being put to death; for though we reade of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Law that God ever gave to his people, that thoſe that fled to his altar ſhould thereby be ſecured; yet that it was of old a cuſtome for malefactours to fly to the altar for ſhelter, is evident Exod. 21.14. <hi>But if a man come preſumptuouſly upon his neighbour to ſlay him with guile, thou ſhalt take him from mine altar, that he may die,</hi> to wit, either becauſe it was held a kind of impiety to ſhed the bloud of a man in that holy place, whither none might enter that had touched any dead thing; or to draw them by violence, as it were from God, that were fled to him for ſuccour: or elſe, becauſe the altar being the place where God did ſhew forth the riches of his grace in accepting an atonement for ſinne, this hanging upon the altar was a kind of pleading that mercy ſhould be ſhewn to them even for Gods ſake, who had ſhewn ſuch mercy to man in the pardon of his ſinnes; and hence it was that Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah caught hold now on the horns of the altar: he that perhaps deſpiſed Gods altar formerly, was glad now to fly thither to ſave his life.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 52. <hi>And Solomon ſaid, If he will ſhew himſelf a worthy man, there ſhall not an hair of him fall to the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, if for the time to come he will carry himſelf faithfully and fairly, as a ſubject ought to do, not the leaſt hurt ſhall be done him; <hi>but if wickedneſſe ſhall be found in him,</hi> that is, if he be found any way falſe and treacherous for the time to come, then he ſhall certainly, without any mercy, be put to death.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 53. <hi>And Solomon ſaid unto him, Go to thine houſe.]</hi> That is, withdraw thy ſelf to thine houſe, and live there a private life, onely taking care of thine own domeſtick buſineſſes and affairs; and take heed that you meddle no more with the matters of the kingdome.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Thou knoweſt alſo what Joab the ſonne of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains,</hi> &amp;c.] It is hard to ſay what this is which David here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that Joab did him; ſome think it is meant of his killing Abſalom, when he had given a charge to the contrary; others underſtand it of ſome other action of diſloyalty towards David, which is not expreſſed in the Scripture: but more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, either that it is meant of Joabs inſolency towards him in generall, of which he often complained, as 2. Sam. 3.39. <hi>And I am this day weak though an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed king, and theſe men the ſonnes of Zeruiah be too hard for me;</hi> or elſe of that which here followeth, his treacherous killing Abner and Amaſa, wherein Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid profeſſeth himſelf to have been much wronged; firſt, becauſe good Princes look upon the injuries done to their ſubjects, as done to themſelves (and ſo doth Chriſt, Acts 9.9. <hi>And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice ſaying unto him, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>) ſecondly, becauſe David had engaged his faith, both to Abner and Amaſa, that they ſhould be ſafe, ſo that it redounded much to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when they were afterward ſo treacherouſly ſlain; it was enough to make the people think that he had ſecretly a hand in it: however, theſe things he alledgeth here againſt Joab, both to ſhew how juſtly Solomon might put him to death, though he had ſpared him, as alſo to imply how dangerous it was for Solomon to let him live: how il-affected he was towards him, was evident by his conſpiracy with Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah; and what miſchief might not be feared from him, that had his hands already ſo fouly embrued in bloud? now to aggravate his murthering of theſe two captains, he ſaith, firſt that <hi>he ſhed the bloud of warre in peace,</hi> that is, when there was peace made with them he ſlew them, as if they had been in open hoſtility againſt David, and ſecondly, that <hi>he put the bloud of warre upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his ſhoes that were on his feet,</hi> to wit, when embracing them he ſtabbed them with the ſword that hung at his girdle, and ſo they fell down dead at his feet; and this expreſſion I conceive is uſed in deſcribing theſe his impious facts, either to ſet forth the baſe perfidious manner of his murthering them, to wit, that ſtabbing them, when he pretended to embrace them, their bloud by that means guſhed out upon his girdle, and ranne down upon his ſhoes; or elſe his boldneſſe and impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in that he was not aſhamed thus treacherouſly to ſlain himſelf with the bloud of theſe men, but did rather glory in it, going up and down with their bloud upon his girdle, or upon his ſword hanging at his girdle, which he had put up all bloudy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſcabbard, and ſo alſo on the ſhoes he wore ſtained with their bloud.</p>

leſt Solomon ſhould think, alas he hath not long to live by the ordinary courſe of nature; let him alone, and within a while he will die of himſelf, and then the world will be rid of him; to prevent this David expreſſeth his charge thus, that his hoar head muſt not go down to the grave in peace: but why did not David cut off Joab himſelf, but put it now upon his ſonne Solomon? I anſwer, firſt, becauſe Joab had alwayes been faithfull to David, whereas he had already ſhown his ill will to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, by ſiding with Adonijah againſt him, and therefore it was now more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to let him live: ſecondly, David could never ſo well do it, as now Solomon might; in his younger years Joab had more power and eſteem amongſt the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of the kingdome, whoſe generall he was, then he had now in his old age, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince he had loſt his credit ſo much amongſt them, by conſpiring with Adonijah againſt his bedrid father; and beſides, David being continually encumbred with warres, was thereby conſtrained to comply with Joab in regard of his great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power amongſt the ſouldiers, which Solomon in regard of the peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his reigne, of which God had aſſured David, would have no need to do; and therefore though David durſt not proceed againſt him, <hi>the ſonnes of Zeruiah,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be too hard for me,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.39. yet Solomon might ſafely enough doe it: and thirdly, though David failed in ſparing Ioab, yet now at his death he repented him of it, and ſo enjoyned his ſonne to do that which he had neglected to do.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>For ſo they came to me when I fled becauſe of Abſalom thy Brother.]</hi> This word [<hi>ſo]</hi> hath reference to that he ſaid before, <hi>let them be of thoſe that eat at thy table;</hi> it is as if he had ſaid, they ſhewed me the very ſame kindneſſe which I deſire thou ſhouldeſt ſhew to them; they brought for me and my followers when I was in diſtreſſe, and therefore it is no leſſe then juſt, that thou ſhouldeſt alwayes bid them welcome to thy table.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Thou haſt with thee Shimei the ſonne of Gera a Benjamite of Bahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, which curſed me with a grievous curſe,</hi> &amp;c.] David calls the reviling and the reprochfull ſpeeches of Shimei againſt him, <hi>a grievous curſe;</hi> firſt, becauſe he called him a <hi>bloudie man,</hi> and did in effect ſay that he had been the cauſe of the death of Saul and all his ſonnes; and to him that knew what a grievous ſinne bloudſhed was, and that was deeply at that time wounded for ſhedding the bloud of Uriah and others, though he were innocent in regard of that he charged him with concerning Saul and his ſonnes, it muſt needs be very greivous to have ſuch an aſperſion caſt upon him: ſecondly, becauſe he called him <hi>a man of Belial,</hi> an ungracious wretch, that had no fear of God in him; and to a man of ſo tender a conſcience as David was, how bitter muſt this needs be? and thirdly, becauſe he upbraided him with the rebellion of his ſonne Abſalom, as the juſt curſe and vengeance of God upon him, for the wrong he had done to Saul his father-in-law, then which, nothing could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly wound his heart more deeply, 2. Sam. 16.7, 8. <hi>Come out, come out, then bloudy man, thou man of Belial, the Lord hath returned upon thee all the bloud of the houſe of Saul,</hi> &amp;c. Now however afterwards this Shimei came and fauned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on David, yet conſidering how bitterly he had vented his ſpleen againſt David in the time of his diſtreſſe, he was exceeding jealous, leſt encouraged by the youth of his ſonne, he ſhould attempt any thing againſt him after his deceaſe, and therefore gave aſtrict charge to Solomon to watch over him narrowly, and to take ſome occaſion to cut him off.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>So David ſlept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.]</hi> In 1, Chron. 29.28. it is ſaid, that <hi>he died in a good old age, full of dayes, riches and honour;</hi> here the place of his buriall is named, to wit, that it was in the citie of David, that is, in that part of Jeruſalem where he dwelt and kept his court, and which he had firſt taken out of the hands of the Jebuſites, which was thence cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the citie of David:</hi> even the place of his buriall was an honour to him, and it ſeems his ſepulchre was ſtrangely preſerved, notwithſtanding Jeruſalem was ſo oft ſacked and burnt, for it continued unto the Apoſtles times, as the Apoſtle Peter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Acts 2.29. <hi>Men and Brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the Patriach David, that he is both dead and buried, and his ſepulchre is with us unto this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And ſhe ſaid, Comest thou peaceably?]</hi> She might eaſily ſuſpect that Adonijah did even ſwell with envy againſt Solomon, and againſt her too, becauſe by her means his conſpiracy was defeated, and therefore when ſhe ſaw him come in to her, ſhe was jealous preſently of ſome plot he had againſt her, and her ſonne, and thence enquired whether he came peaceably or no.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he ſaid, Thou knoweſt that the kingdome was mine, and that all Iſrael ſet their faces upon me,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in regard that I was king, and in a fair way to have had the kingdome ſettled upon me, by the favour of the people, who looked upon me as my fathers eldeſt ſonne, though I be now but a private ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (and content to be ſo, ſince it was of God that my brother Solomon ſhould reigne) I hope you will be willing to afford me what honour a ſubject may be capable of, and will not deny me any reaſonable requeſt that I ſhall make to you: how farre Adonijah was from being really convinced that it was of God that Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was king, or from a quiet ſubmiſſion to the good providence of God therein, is evident by the plot he had now in hand to get Abiſhag to wife, that ſo he might wreſt the kingdome from Solomon; onely to hide his drift in deſiring Abiſhag to wife, he would ſeem to be fully ſatisfied, concerning Solomons being king, <hi>the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is turned about, and is become my brothers, for it was his from the Lord,</hi> and onely to deſire, that by conſidering what great hopes he was fallen from, ſhe would compaſſionate his condition, and be the readier to gratifie him in any thing a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might lawfully deſire.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king,</hi> &amp;c.] The onely reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged here by Adonijah, why he made choice of Bathſheba to get Solomons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for his marrying Abiſhag, is the great intereſt ſhe had in the king her ſonne (<hi>for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he will not ſay thee nay</hi>) but yet conſidering that there were many others that were of power enough to have obtained any reaſonable requeſt of the king for him, we may well think that there was another thing that induced him to ſet her a work in this buſineſſe; namely, the hope of winning her to undertake his petition, &amp; indeed accordingly it came to paſſe: though Bathſheba were ſo wiſe a woman, that her counſel to her ſonne is recorded by the ſpirit of God in the holy Scripture, Prov. 31.1. yet ſhe could not diſcern his drift, but being gulled with his fair words, and her melting thoughts of compaſſion towards him, ſhe undertook that ſuit of his,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:42229:237"/>
whereby he thought to undermine her ſonne, and at laſt to ſhoulder him out of the throne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And ſhe ſaid, Let Abiſhag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.]</hi> Thus ſhe intimates that becauſe he was his brother, forgetting what was paſt, he ſhould do well to gratifie him in any reaſonable requeſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Ask for him the kingdome alſo (for he is mine elder brother) even for him, and for Abiathar</hi> &amp;c.] There is nothing in the text whence we can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, whether Adonijah had a purpoſe again to wreſt the kingdome from Solomon, and had for that cauſe by the adviſe of his confederates, Abiathar and Joab, ſought to obtain Abiſhag to wife; yet it may ſeem probable: firſt, by the ſtrangeneſſe of the ſuite, that he ſhould deſire her to wife, who had lain either as his wife or concubine, in the boſome of his own father: ſecondly, by Solomons ſevere proceeding againſt him; for though by an ordinary way of providence he might have ſuſpected that Adonijah had ſome plot in this ſuit of his; yet becauſe he did ſo certainly conclude of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that preſently without any more ado he adjudged him to death, this m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kes it moſt probable that the drift of Adonijah was diſcovered to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon by a ſpeciall inſtinct of the ſpirit of God: and thirdly, by Joabs flying to the altar upon this, and not before, verſ. 28. however it is evident that Solomon took it ſo to wit, that by the friends Abiſhag had gotten whileſt ſhe lay in his fathers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, he hoped to increaſe his faction; and happely alſo, by marrying a wife of the deceaſed king to ſtrengthen his crakt title, and that becauſe it was ſtill the ſucceſſours right to have the deceaſed kings concubines, 2. Sam. 12.8. <hi>And I gave thee thy maſters houſe, and thy masters wives into thy boſome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ask for him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the kingdome alſo,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, this is it which he looks after, and with him Joab and Abiathar too; having already the plea of being the elder brother, and Abiathar the high prieſt, and Joab the Generall on his ſide, if he could ſtrengthen himſelf alſo by this marriage, then he would not fear to ſhew himſelf, and to obtain his deſire.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Then king Solomon ſware by the Lord.]</hi> That his mother might not interpoſe any further in the buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>As the Lord liveth, which hath establiſhed me and ſet me on the throne,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as ſurely as the Lord liveth, who hath done this for me, ſo ſurely ſhall Adonijah be put to death, and that <hi>this day;</hi> there muſt be no delay in a matter of ſuch danger: though Solomon had beforehand promiſed his mother to grant her requeſt, yet his intention was therein onely, to grant her any reaſonable requeſt, and therefore not thinking that any tie to intangle him for the granting of that which might prove the ruin both of himſelf and her, in ſtead of ſatisfiing her deſire, he took on oath that Adonijah ſhould preſently be put to death; he had formerly pardoned him onely upon condition of his loyaltie for the time to come, chap, 1.52. which having now forfeited by this ſecond attempt, even for his former conſpiracie it was fit he ſhould die. As for the mention that he makes in his oath of Gods eſtabliſhing him in the throne, that was becauſe his aſſurance that God had placed him in the throne, was that which encouraged him to proceed thus againſt Adonijah; he that had ſet him in the throne, he knew, would ſtand by him, and defend him herein; but however, here we ſee ſtill that verified, which Nathan had threatned againſt Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, 2. Sam. 12.10. <hi>The ſword ſhall never depart from thine houſe.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>So Solomon thruſt out Abiathar from being prieſt unto the Lord: that he might fulfill the word of the Lord, which he spake concerning the houſe of Eli in Ehiloh.]</hi> For by this means, according as God had threatned Eli above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years ſince, 1. Sam. 2.31.35. the high prieſthood was transferred from the poſterity of Eli, who was of the ſtock of Ithamar, to Zadok who was deſcended of Eleazar.

                     <hi>For Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Abſalom.]</hi> This clauſe is inſerted; firſt, to ſhew the cauſe of his fear and danger, his ſiding with Adonijah: and ſecondly, to intimate the hand of God in this buſineſſe; for how came it to paſſe that he that had ſtuck ſo faithfully to David in the caſe of Abſalom, ſhould now take part with Adonijah in his uſurpation? ſurely it was, that the bloud of Abner and Amaſa might fall upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And he ſaid, Nay, but I will die here.]</hi> This Joab ſpake doubtleſſe, as hoping that by hanging on the altar, he ſhould ſave his life, and that they would not there put him to death; indeed it is ſtrange that he ſhould ſo think, conſidering the Law of God was ſo expreſſe, Exod. 21.15. that he that had ſlain a man wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be taken from the altar, and be put to death; but for this we muſt know that Joab dreamed not now of being put to death, for his murthering of Abner and Amaſa; but onely of his conſpiracy with Adonijah, in which caſe he hoped the altar might be a refuge to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And the king ſaid unto him, Do as he hath ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] This Solomon enjoyned, as conceiving that the Lord, who allowed not that the altar ſhould be a ſhelter to wilfull murderers, would not be diſpleaſed that Joab ſhould be ſlain there, if he could not be drawn thence; yet perhaps Benaiah had before bidden Joab come forth voluntarily out of the tabernacle, and ſo Solomon gave him here a charge one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to draw him thence by force, and then to ſlay him; for indeed, the words of the Law are, Exod. 21.14. that he ſhould be taken from the altar and ſlain; and the ſame courſe we ſee was taken with Athaliah, 2. Kings 11.15. <hi>have her forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ranges; and him that followeth, kill with the ſword: for the prieſt had ſaid, Let her not be ſlain in the houſe of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>On the day thou goeſt out, and paſſeſt over the brook Kidron,</hi> &amp;c.] It is evident in the former verſe, that he was not to go any way out of Jeruſalem; yet here his going over the brook Kidron is particularly expreſſed, becauſe that was the way to Bahurim, where he formerly dwelt &amp; where his inheritance lay, 2. Sam. 16.5.</p>

It may juſtly be wondred at, that Shimei ſhould for the recovery of his two runaway ſervants, venture to go out of Jeruſalem, when he knew that his life lay upon it; but for this we muſt conſider, firſt, that covetouſneſſe doth ordinarily ſo beſot men, that it makes them do that which is moſt unreaſonable: ſecondly, that perhaps he was ſo tranſported with paſſion againſt his ſervants, that either he thought not of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or elſe, however could not forbear: thirdly, that he might flatter himſelf with vain hopes, that doing this ſecretly, it would not be known; it was now three years ſince this charge was given him, verſ. 39. and by this time he might hope that Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon would not ſo heedfully mind, what he did at firſt ſo ſtrictly command; he had matters of ſtate, of greater importance to intend, and therefore going ſecretly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ſpeedily, there would be no notice taken of ſuch an outſcape as this was: and fourthly, that there was doubtleſſe an over-ruling hand of Gods providence in it, that carried him on headlong upon his own ruine, that ſo he might receive his juſt reward for his baſe reviling of David the Lords anointed, in the time of his affliction.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Solomon made affinitie with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaohs daughter.]</hi> David had married Solomon to Naamah the Ammoniteſſe before he died, as is evident, becauſe Rehoboam the ſonne of Solomon by this Naamah, was born a full year before Solomon was king, for Solomon reigned in all but fourty years, chap. 11.42. and Rehoboam was one and fourty years old when he came to be king in the room of his father, chap. 14.21. ſo that if Solomon took this daughter of Pharaoh to wife after Shimei's death, as it is here ſet down in the ſtory, who had lived three years in Jeruſalem after Solomon was king, chap. 2.39. this marriage, was many years after his marriage with Naamah, at leaſt in the fourth, or fifth yeare of his reigne; whether Naamah were at that time dead, or no, it is no where expreſſed; but however, that one chief aim in this match, was to ſtrengthen himſelf, by joyning himſelf in affinitie with ſuch a potent neighbour
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:42229:238"/>
Prince, as the king of Egypt now was, is evident; for therefore it is not ſaid barely, that he took Pharaohs daughter to wife, but that he <hi>made affinitie with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharoahs daughter,</hi> &amp;c. implying, that to joyn himſelf in affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the king of Egypt, was the great plot of this match; it is not ſaid whether ſhe had embraced the Religion of the Iſraelites, when he took her to wife; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that he is no where blamed for this marriage, nor any thing ſaid, but that as yet he continued to walk in Gods wayes (the high places onely excepted) it is moſt like ſhe forſook her idolatry; and however, that either before or after her marriage, ſhe became a proſelyte, and worſhipped the true God, we cannot well queſtion, becauſe Solomon in this marriage, is made a type of Chriſt, who wooed the Gentiles, and made them his ſpouſe, calling them from their idolatries, to ſerve the true and everlaſting God, for hereto the Pſalmiſt ſeems to allude, Pſal. 45.10. <hi>Hearken (O daughter) and conſider, and encline thine eare: forget alſo thine own people, and thy fathers houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And brought her into the citie of David, untill he had made an end of building his own houſe.]</hi> That is, having taken the daughter of Pharaoh to wife, he brought her into the citie of David, but yet he did not diſpoſe of her in his own houſe there, but in ſome other part of the citie, and that either becauſe his own houſe was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to entertain her, and all her retinue; or becauſe he was at that time in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or at leaſt had purpoſed to build a fair palace for himſelf, with another adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto for his Queen, chap. 7.8. and ſo in that part of the citie of David ſhe continued, <hi>untill he had made an end of building his own houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the wall of Jeruſalem round about.</hi> Now this laſt clauſe concerning the wall of Jeruſalem, is, I conceive, added onely by the way to give a hint how the glory of Solomons kingdome, did ſtill flouriſh in every thing more and more; that Jeruſalem was walled about before this time, is evident. 2. Sam. 5.9. and 1. Chron. 11.8. but it ſeems Solomon did either erect a new wall without the old; or elſe, repair, enlarge, and fortifie the old, building them with many ſtately towers and bulworks, and ſo this city, which was the place of his reſidence, became farre the more glorious.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Onely the people ſacrificed in high places,</hi> &amp;c.] This I conceive hath reference to that which is ſaid before, concerning the flouriſhing eſtate of Solomon, in the laſt verſe of the former chapter, and the beginning of this; his royall glory was every way great, onely this, ſaith the text, was a blemiſh which ſtained the glory of his kingdome, that as yet the people, yea and Solomon too, did offer ſacrifices in their high places, verſ. 3. which was directly againſt the Law, Deut. 12.13, 14. but of theſe high places, ſee the note 1. Sam. 9.12.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the king went to Gibeon to ſacrifice there for that was the great high place.]</hi> That is, the largeſt and faireſt, the moſt famous, and moſt reſorted to, and that happely becauſe the tabernacle of Moſes was there, and therefore did Solomon go thither, and with him all the chief of the Princes and Governours of the people, whom he had called together, 2. Chron. 1.2, 3. concerning which, ſee the note there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And Solomon ſaid, Thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant David my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great mercy,</hi> &amp;c.] This he ſaid in his heart being aſleep; for God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the langague of the heart, as well as that of the tongue, and as the Lord can enable men to attend upon that which he ſayes to them in their ſleep, ſo he can alſo
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:42229:239"/>
give them power diſtinctly, and with the full and free uſe of their reaſon, their ſleep no way diſturbing their phancy, to poure forth the deſires of their ſouls in prayer to him; and yet it may well be too that the intention of his mind all the day before, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſervice of God, made him fitter for the impreſſion of ſuch holy deſires, and thoughts, when he was aſleep; and particularly to beg wiſdome of God, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of all things he had moſt deſired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thou hast kept for him this great kindneſſe, that thou haſt given him a ſonne to ſit on his throne,</hi> &amp;c.] This was ſpoken in reference to Saul, though God made Saul king over Iſrael as well as David; yet he did not give it to Saul and his heirs, and ſucceſſours, as he did to David; this was a peculiar favour and honour which God reſerved for David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.]</hi> That is, young and unexperienced in ſtate affairs, and in compariſon of this great burthen, which muſt now lie upon me, a very child: ſo the Prophet Jeremy alſo ſpeaks of himſelf, Jer. 1.6. <hi>then ſaid I, Ah Lord God, I cannot ſpeak, for I am a child:</hi> ſome writers would hence conclude, that Solomon was not above twelve years old when he began to reigne, if not younger, and ſo withall are forced to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that at eleven years of age, he begat his ſonne Rehoboam (for it is manifeſt Rehoboam was born the yeare before he began his reigne, becauſe he reigned in all but fourty years, chap. 11.42. and Rehoboam was one and fourty years old when he ſucceeded him in the throne) but there is no cauſe why we ſhould entangle our ſelves with ſuch difficulties becauſe Solomon ſaith here <hi>I am but a little child:</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe David ſaid of him, 1. Chron. 22.5. <hi>Solomon my ſonne is young and tender:</hi> for on the other ſide before this, we ſee how David ſpake of him, chap. 2.9. <hi>thou art a wiſe man, and knowest what thou oughteſt to do unto him;</hi> for thus the Scripture uſually ſpeaks of young men; Iſhmael is called a child, when he was at leaſt eighteen years old, Gen. 21.14, 15. and David <hi>a youth,</hi> and <hi>ſtripling,</hi> 1. Sam. 17.23. whereas before, 1. Sam. 16.18. he is called <hi>a mighty valiant man, and a man of warre;</hi> and much more might Solomon uſe this term of himſelf, when he ſpeaks comparatively, with reſpect to that great charge of governing Gods people, which now lay upon him, though he were, as probably it is thought he was, at leaſt twenty years old.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>There was none like thee before thee, neither after thee ſhall any ariſe like unto thee.]</hi> To wit, for wiſdome; ſome referre this onely to the kings of Iſrael, namely, that there was never any king in Iſrael, either before Solomon, or after him, that equalled him in wiſdome, and indeed in the following verſe, where he is promiſed riches and honour above all others, it is expreſſely limited to kings, <hi>And I have alſo given thee that which thou haſt not asked, both riches and honour, ſo that there ſhall not be any among the kings like unto thee:</hi> but yet if we underſtand this of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall wiſdome, and not of ſupernaturall wiſedome, which was reſerved as the ſpeciall priviledge of Gods ſervants, in the dayes of the Goſpel; I ſee not but that theſe words may be taken as they are expreſſed, without any ſuch limitation; namely, that there was never mere man, ſince the fall of Adam, like unto Solomon for wiſdome, which ſeems the more probable, becauſe in the next chapter, the compariſon is made betwixt him and others that were not kings, and of other nations too as well as Iſraelites, verſ. 30.31. <hi>Solomons wiſedome, excelled the wiſedome of all the children of
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:42229:239"/>
the East country, and all the wiſedome of Egypt, for he was wiſer than all men, then Ethan the Ezrahite,</hi> &amp;c. and herein was Solomon a notable type of Chriſt, Col. 2.3. <hi>in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>So that there ſhall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy dayes.]</hi> That is, among the kings of Iſrael there ſhall be none like thee for riches and honour: and in the Chronicles this is more generally expreſſed, namely, that he ſhould excell in riches and glory all before him, and all after him, 2 Chron. 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Solomon awoke, and behold it was a dreame</hi> &amp;c.] That is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he perceived that God had in a ſupernaturall dreame appeared unto him, and ſo return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Then came there two women that were harlots unto the King,</hi> &amp;c.] The Hebrew word here tranſlated <hi>harlots,</hi> ſignifieth either <hi>victuallers</hi> or <hi>harlots,</hi> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be thought that they were ſuch as did openly profeſſe themſelves Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers though they were more ſecretly harlots: for it is not ſo likely that they durſt thus have preſented themſelves before the King, if they had beene known to be ſuch as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo openly in ſo lewd a courſe of life: that the people might the more reverence Solomon, the Lord was pleaſed by this controverſie that was brought before him, to let them ſee what a ſingular meaſure of wiſedome he had conferred upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And it came to paſſe the third day after I was deliver'd, that this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was deliver'd alſo,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby is ſhown in part, what it was that made the caſe in queſtion ſo difficult; namely, that both children were ſo neare of an age, the one being borne but three dayes after the other: and indeed if we adde to this, firſt, that the feature of the dead child would be ſo altered by death, that it muſt needs be hard for thoſe neighbours and friends that had ſeene it alive, to ſay to which of the women it did belong; ſecondly, that no body was by when this fact was done, that might bear witneſſe on either ſide; thirdly that the mother of the live child confeſſed ſhe was aſleep, and ſo did not ſee when her child was taken away; and fourthly, that the parties contending for the child were of equall repute, the one deſerving no more credit than the other, becauſe they were both harlots, all theſe things joyntly conſidered, muſt needs make the caſe ſo difficult, that when it came to be brought before the king, it may well be, it was thought the wit of man could not determine it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And ſhe aroſe at mid-night, and tooke my ſonne from beſide me,</hi> &amp;c.] But why ſhould ſhe be willing to keep another womans child? I anſwer, women are naturally aſhamed of overlaying their children, to avoid this diſgrace, in the heat of her paſſion, ſhe could have beene content to nurſe up another child in ſtead of her owne, rather than have it ſaid, that by her ſlothfulneſſe and negligence, ſhe had beene the death of her owne child.</p>

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:42229:240"/>
yet that may be becauſe they did ſome yeares after marry them; for when Solomon came to the crowne, we read not of any child he had born, but only Rehoboam, and much leſſe could he have any daughter mariageable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Azariah the ſon of Zadok the prieſt.]</hi> Azariah <hi>the ſon,</hi> that is, the grand child of <hi>Zadok</hi> (for he was the ſon of Ahimaaz the ſon of Zadok, 1 Chro. 6.8.9.) is here ſaid to have been <hi>the prieſt,</hi> that is, Solomons prieſt, becauſe it ſeems he was continually imployed for him (as our Princes houſhold Chaplaines are for them) in thoſe things that concerned the worſhip and ſervice of God. Or it may be meant of the ſon of ſome other Zadok; for the word here tranſlated <hi>Prieſt,</hi> may alſo be tranſlated <hi>chiefe Officer,</hi> as is expreſſed in the margin of our Bibles.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Elihoreph and Ahiah, the ſonnes of Shiſha, Scribes.]</hi> We read but of one Scribe, or Secretary of State that David had, 2 Sam. 20.25. but Solomon had two; which ſhewes, that the dominion and royaltie of Solomons Kingdome was greater than his fathers, and ſo therewith the ſtate affaires muſt needs increaſe.</p>

And beſides, that he had been the chiefe among them, is ſufficient to make him be reckoned here amongſt thoſe that were in eminent place whether in Church or Common-wealth, in the firſt yeares of Solomons reigne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And Azariah the ſonne of Nathan was over the officers,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive that theſe were the ſonnes of Nathan the ſonne of David, but the moſt hold, that they were the ſons of Nathan the prophet, preferred by Solomon, partly out of a gratefull reſpect which he bare to their father, partly becauſe he had had his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them under the tutouridge of Nathan their father, as the Hebrews hold.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Thou knoweſt how that David my father could not build an houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by common report. It is ſaid alſo, that Solomon alledged the kindneſſe Hiram had ſhowne to his father, in ſending him Cedars to build himſelfe an houſe, (whereof we have heard before, 2 Sam. 5.11.) and deſired him to afford him the like favour for the building of a Temple for the Lord, 2 Chron. 2.3. <hi>And Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſent to Hiram the king of Tyre, ſaying, As thou dideſt deal with David my father, and diddeſt ſend him Cedars tO build him an houſe to dwell therein, even ſo deal with me.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Command thou, that they hew me Cedar trees out of Lebanon,</hi> &amp;c.] Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Expoſitours hold, that Libanus was a part of Solomons land, and that he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Hiram only workmen to hew timber. But 1. becauſe it is ſaid, that Hiram ſent Cedars as a preſent to David, 2 Sam. 5.11. <hi>And Hiram king of Tyre ſent meſſengers to David, and Cedar trees</hi> &amp;c. And 2. becauſe of the great quantity of corne and oyle which Solomon gave to Hiram yeare by yeare, in liew of this which he required of him verſe 11. <hi>And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thouſand mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wheat for food to his houſhold, and twenty meaſures of pure oyle: thus gave Solomon to Hiram yeare by yeare. I</hi> rather thinke that Libanus was in the poſſeſſion of the king of Tyre, though it were the utmoſt bounds northward of the land of Canaan, and that Solomon therefore had the timber alſo from him: or elſe, it may be, that Libanus being a large tract of mountains, was partly in Solomons territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, though moſt in Hirams, and ſo both may be true, that moſt of the materials he had from Hiram, and that ſuch timber as was cut in Solomons territories, was hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo by Hirams ſervants.

man cunning to worke in gold and ſilver, &amp;c. 2 Chron. 2.7, 8. It is indeed ſaid, that David before his death prepared abundantly both workemen and Cedar trees, and all other neceſſaries, 1 Chron. 22.2, 3, 4, 14.15. and 1 Chron. 29.2. But the meaning of that is only, that he prepared exceeding much, not that he prepared e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough or more then enough, both for the houſe, and the holy utenſiles therof; though he had provided exceeding aboundantly, yet there was much more wanting, which Solomon therefore now takes care to provide.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thouſand meaſures of wheat for food to his houſhould,</hi> &amp;c.] Solomon when firſt he ſent to Hiram, proffered his ſervants <hi>twenty thouſand meaſures of beaten wheat,</hi> and as many of barley, <hi>twenty thouſand bathes of wine,</hi> and as many of oyl, for their hire and proviſion, as ye ſee it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, 2. Chron. 2.10. yea, it ſeems he added, that if that ſhould not like him he would give whatſoever hire himſelf would appoint (as we ſee above, verſ. 6.) now when Hiram anſwered Solomon by writing, he accepted of that proviſion that was proffered for his ſervants, 2. Chron. 2.15. but withall made it a requeſt to him, as we ſee above, verſ. 9. that Solomon would grant him liberty to tranſport a certain quantitie of proviſion every yeare, for his own houſhold, becauſe his countrey was but barren for ſuch things; and this is that which here it is ſaid Solomon gave Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram; for that proviſion of wheat, and barley, and wine, and oyl, mentioned, 2. Chron. 2.10. was given to the ſubjects of the king of Tyre, that were employed about So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons work: ſee the note alſo, chap. 9.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And king Solomon raiſed a levie out of all Iſrael, and the levie was thirty thouſand men.]</hi> That is, of the Iſraelites that were skilfull workmen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carpenters or maſons, throughout his kingdome; for though <hi>Solomon did make no bondmen of the children of Iſrael,</hi> 1. Kings 9.22. but imployed ſtrangers in the more ſervile imployments, and harder labours, of bearing burdens, and hewing in the mountains, 2. Chron. 2.17, 18. yet it is altogether improbable, that either there were no artificers amongſt the Iſraelites, though inferiour to the Tyrians, or that ſuch as were able for the work, were wholy neglected, and onely ſtrangers imployed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And Solomon had threeſcore and ten thouſand that bare burdens,</hi> &amp;c.] And theſe were of the ſtrangers that were in the land, as we find it expreſſed, 2. Chron. 2.17, 18.</p>

Chron. 3.1. the place is alſo expreſſed where the Temple was built, to wit, that it was at <hi>Jeruſalem in mount Moriah</hi> (the very place in which Abraham was commanded to ſacrifice his ſonne, Gen. 22.2.) <hi>where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threſhing floore of Ornan the Jebuſite.</hi> Now both the place and the time when the foundation of this houſe was firſt laid, are thus punctually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, not onely becauſe it was indeed the moſt glorious and ſumptuous building that ever was in the world, but alſo eſpecially becauſe it was <hi>the houſe of the Lord,</hi> as it is here called, the place which he choſe for his ſettled habitation, amongſt the children of Iſrael, and ſo was a type or figure, firſt, of Chriſt, <hi>for in him dwelleth al the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. ſecondly, of every true Chriſtian and that becauſe God dwells in them by his holy ſpirit, <hi>Know ye not that your bodie is the Temple of the holy Ghost which is in you?</hi> 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And againſt the wall of the houſe, hee built Chambers round about,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, weſtward, northward, and ſouthward, round about the houſe he built Chambers, (for on the eaſt ſide before the porch, where was the court of the prieſts, there could be no chambers built) and becauſe theſe chambers were built up cloſe to the houſe on the outſide of the walls, ſo that the beams of the upper floores of theſe Chambers were laid on that ſide towards the Temple, upon the very wall of the Temple, therefore it may be well ſaid, that theſe Chambers were built <hi>againſt the wall of the houſe,</hi> that is, cloſe adjoyning thereto, or, as it is in the margin, <hi>upon the wall of the houſe;</hi> there were of theſe Chambers three ſtories or rows, each above the other, and each of them <hi>five Cubits high,</hi> verſe 10. and they were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe provided for the lodging of the prieſts, for the laying up of the holy things of the Temple, and ſuch other uſes, for of theſe partly is that ſpoken, 1 Chro. 28.11, 12. <hi>Then David gave to Solomon his ſonne the pattern of the porch, and of the houſes thereof, and of the treaſuries thereof, and of the upper Chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy ſeat: And the pattern of all that he had by the ſpirit, of the Courts of the houſe of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>For without in the wall of the houſe he made narrowed reſts round about,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added to ſhew, how it came to paſſe that the middle Chambers were broader than the undermoſt, and the third loft, broader by a Cubit than the middle ones; the reaſon was, becauſe to the end that the beams might not be faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the wall of the Temple, but might be only laid upon the outlets of the wall, and ſo if occaſion were, might be removed without any dammage to the wall, at every five Cubits high, (for that was the height of the Chambers, verſe 10.) he narrowed the Temple walls a cubit in breadth; as ſuppoſe the wall was at the ground ſix cubits broad, (according to that Ezek. 41.5. <hi>He meaſured the wall of the houſe ſix cubits,</hi>) when they had built it five cubits high, there they narrowed the wall a cubit in breadth, and built it up five cubits broad, and on that outlet of the wall, was the beams of the firſt floore laid, and by that means, the Chambers there were a cubit broader than thoſe beneath, and ſo likewiſe it was againe at the third floore, there they left a cubit ſpace for the beams of the third floore to reſt upon, and built
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:42229:244"/>
up the wall but foure Cubits broad, and ſo thoſe Chambers were ſeven Cubits broad.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>There was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any toole of Iron, heard in the houſe while it was in building.]</hi> To wit, becauſe all the ſtones and timber were hewed and fitted for the building, before they were brought to the the place where the Temple was built; and this was done, partly out of a reverent reſpect, to the ends for which the houſe was built, and partly to ſignifie, firſt, that in the Church, the houſe of God, all ſhould be carried on in a peaceable way, without any of thoſe jarres and tumults that are in the world: ſecondly, to ſignifie the everlaſting peace of the Church in heaven, whereof the Temple was eſpecially a type; here the beſt are ſometimes at variance, but there they ſhall live in perfect peace, here they are hewed, and ſquared, and fitted for the Temple of God in heaven, partly by the word, <hi>I have hewed them by the Prophets,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Hoſ. 6.5. and partly by afflictions, which is for paring away their corruptions, but when they come to be joyned to the Church triumphant in heaven, there will be no need of any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>The doore for the middle chamber was in the right ſide of the houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in the ſouth ſide, for that in the Scripture is called the right ſide of the world, as is evident, Pſalm. 89.12, where that which is tranſlated <hi>the North and the South, thou haſt created them,</hi> is in the Originall, <hi>the North and the right ſide thou haſt created them;</hi> and the right ſide of the Temple, to wit, as they came out of the Temple, with their faces eaſtward: It ſeemes therefore, that in the ſide of the Temples wall, either in the holy place, or elſe rather in the porch, there was a doore whereby they turned into the loweſt floore of the chambers, built on the outſide of the houſe, from whence <hi>they went up with winding ſtaires</hi> (which were happely in the thickneſſe of the Temples wall) <hi>into the middle chamber,</hi> that is, the middle ſtory, which was divided doubtleſſe into ſeverall chambers, and ſo <hi>out of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle into the third:</hi> now if there were no other doore with ſtaires to goe up, but this on the ſouth, it muſt needs be yielded, that from hence they went to the furtheſt chambers on the North ſide; and that by ſome void place, after the manner of a cloyſter below, and galleries above, that went round about the houſe between the chambers and the wall of the Temple: but indeed, the moſt that have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fabrick of the Temple, hold, that there was another doore alſo, with winding ſtaires, going up on the North ſide, though it be not here expreſſed, which they would alſo prove by the deſcription of the doores that led to theſe chambers, Ezek. 41.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>So he built the houſe and finiſhed it,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, the bulk and body of the houſe, for it was not yet cieled and boarded, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And they reſted on the houſe with timber of Cedar.]</hi> That is, the ſide chambers. See the note above verſe 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Concerning this houſe which thou art in building, if thou wilt walke in my Statutes,</hi> &amp;c.] When Solomon had only yet ſet up the frame or body of the houſe, the Lord ſpake to him, either by ſome revelation, or by the miniſtery of ſome Prophet, thereby to encourage him the better to goe on in the work, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, that he would performe the word which he ſpake unto David, to wit, in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:42229:245"/>
making that houſe his ſettled dwelling place, and in ſettling him and his poſteritie to ſit on the throne of Iſrael, onely withall he added this condition, <hi>If thou wilt walk in my Statutes, and execute my judgements, and keep all my commandments,</hi> thereby giving him to underſtand, that however glorious the work was which he had in hand for the ſervice of God, yet it would be of no avail to him, except he were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to live holily and righteouſly in all other reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he built the walls of the houſe within, with boards of Cedar, both the floore of the houſe, and the walls,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the whole wall, from the floore to the cieling, as it is in the margin; or elſe the meaning is, that both floore and roof and all, was on the outſide cedar; for though it is manifeſt that the holy place was cieled with boards of firre, 2. Chron. 3.5. <hi>And the greater houſe he cieled with firre tree,</hi> &amp;c. and floored with the ſame, as it is in the laſt clauſe of this verſe, he <hi>covered the floore of the houſe with planks of firre;</hi> yet perhaps the firre was next the ſtones, and then they were overlaid with cedar.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And he built twenty cubits on the ſides of the houſe, both the floore, and the walls,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as he did to the holy place, ſo alſo in thoſe twenty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits which were ſet out, he covered there alſo, both floore and walls with cedar.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cubits in breath, and twenty cubits in the height thereof.]</hi> So that the oracle or moſt holy place, was every way ſquare: but how is it then ſaid, verſ. 2. of the whole houſe, containing in length threeſcore cubits, that the height thereof was thirty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits? I anſwer, ſome conceive that the oracle was thirty cubits high, as was the reſt of the Temple, but that it is ſaid here to be but twenty cubits high in the forepart of it, becauſe the wall in the forepart of it, whereby the holy place was divided from the moſt holy, was indeed but twenty cubits high, and ſo there was a ſpace of ten cubits above that wall, left open (onely the vail hung before it) at which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe might enter into the moſt holy place, and indeed, ſay they, why ſhould it be thus expreſſed, <hi>that the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in height,</hi> but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the height of the wall on that ſide, from the height of the wall on the other ſides? but, firſt, becauſe theſe words <hi>in the forepart,</hi> have clearly reference to the length and breadth of the oracle, as well as to the height, <hi>And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length,</hi> &amp;c. and ſecondly, becauſe the holy place might be ſaid to be twenty cubits high, as well as the moſt holy, in relation to the wall that divided the one from the other, therefore I think it more probable which others ſay, for the reſolving of this difficultie, to wit, that where it is ſaid, verſ. 2. that the houſe was thirty cubits high, the roof is alſo there included, which went up vault-wiſe, ten cubits higher then the walls, which were but twenty cubits high, neither in the moſt holy, nor in the holy place, and that theſe words are added not to make any difference betwixt the height of the walls in the holy place, and the height of the walls in the oracle (for they were all round about twenty cubits high) but to ſhew that the oracle in the forepart, that is, which was in the forepart of the Temple, the furtheſt part weſtward (for that is here called the forepart of the houſe) was every way ſquare, twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits broad, and twenty cubits high, which could not be ſaid of the Temple or holy place; yea and perhaps too, there went a floore over, from wall to wall in the oracle, whereas the vault-covering of the Temple lay open, and there was no floore over it.</p>

                     <hi>And he overlaid it with pure gold, and ſo covered the altar which was of cedar.]</hi> That is, as he covered the oracle it ſelf with gold, to ſhadow forth the majeſty of God, and the exceeding glory of heaven, ſo alſo he covered the altar with gold, which is therefore called the golden altar, chap. 7.48. being otherwiſe made of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar-wood, as that in the tabernacle was of Shittim wood, Exod. 30.13. concerning which, ſee the note there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>So Solomon overlaid the houſe within with pure gold.]</hi> The gold that was ſpent in overlaying the moſt holy place, amounted to ſix hundred talents, 1. Chron. 3.8. and yet beſides, it was garniſhed with precious ſtones, verſ. 6. <hi>And he garniſhed the houſe with precious ſtones for beauty, and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And he made a partition, by the chains of gold before the oracle.]</hi> That is, the chains whereon the vails hung, before this partition, betwixt the holy and the moſt holy place, 2. Chron. 3.14. <hi>And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon:</hi> that which was made in ſtead of this, at the rebuilding of the Temple, was rent in twain at the death of Chriſt, Matth. 27.51. of the like vail, ſee Exod. 26.31.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And the whole houſe he overlaid with gold.]</hi> That is, not onely the moſt holy place, but alſo the holy, and the upper chambers alſo; yea, and the very nails wherewith the plates were faſtned, had at leaſt heads of gold, the weight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was fifty ſhekels of gold, 2. Chron. 3.9. and the hinges of the doores, chap. 7.50. Now all this was to ſignifie the precious, and glorious gifts and graces of the ſpirit of Chriſt, wherewith every member of Chriſt muſt be adorned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alſo the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.]</hi> That is, that was by the entrance into the oracle, in the holy place, not the moſt holy; ſo was the altar of incenſe placed in the tabernacle, Exod. 30.6. and ſo alſo it was doubtleſſe placed here in the Temple; for into the moſt holy place the high prieſt entered onely once a yeare, Heb. 9.6, 7. but the other prieſts uſed to burn incenſe upon this altar, Luke 1.6. and that twice every day, Exod. 30.7, 8. ſee the notes concerning that altar of incenſe that was in Moſes tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.]</hi> So that beſides the two cherubims of beaten gold, at the ends of the mercy-ſeat, made by Moſes, Exod. 25.18. which were part of the propitiatory wherewith the ark was covered, concerning which ſee the note there; there was now for the moſt holy place in the Temple, two other cherubims made, by Solomons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, of farre greater ſize, but not of beaten gold, as the other were, but of olive wood, covered with plates of gold; and theſe it ſeems were made after the ſhape of men (as appears by that deſcription of them, 2. Chro. 3.13. <hi>They ſtood upon their feet, and their faces were inward,</hi> that is, eaſtward toward the holy place) and were to ſtand before the ark, to hide and cover it from the eyes even of the high prieſt, and to repreſent the glorious maieſty of God and of Chriſt, in the continuall attendance and miniſtery of the Angels; and therefore it may well be, that the ſtature of theſe cherubims ſo farre ſurpaſſing the ſtature of men, ten cubits, that is five yards high, was to repreſent of what mighty ſtrength and excellency the Angels are.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>From the uttermoſt part of the one wing, unto the uttermoſt part of

the other, were ten cubits.]</hi> So that the wings of the one Cherub, took up ten cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which was one half of the breadth of the moſt holy place, verſ. 20. and the other took up the other half: the outer wing of the one touching the South wall, and the outer wing of the other, the North wall, and their inner wings meeting in the middeſt of the houſe. Neither is there any ſpace allowed for the body of the Cherubs, becauſe their wings did ariſe, as it were, out of the middeſt of their backs.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And the floore of the houſe he overlaid with gold, within, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi> That is, both in the Oracle, and without in the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>The lintell and ſide-poſts were a fift part of the wall.]</hi> The partition wall was twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits high, and the doore therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fift part of it, was foure cubits wide, and foure cubits high, narrower by a cubit then the doore of the Temple, which was the fourth part of the wall, verſ. 33. Some read this clauſe thus, <hi>the lintell and ſide-poſts were five ſquare,</hi> and then the meaning I conceive muſt be, that the upper lintell was made of two pieces, which went up in the midſt like the ridge of a houſe; and ſo the doore was five ſquare.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>So alſo made he for the doore of the Temple, poſts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.]</hi> It was therefore five cubits broad; for the partition muſt needs be twenty cubits, the breadth of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>And he built the inner court with three rowes of hewed ſtone, and a row of Cedar beams.]</hi> This Court here mentioned was queſtionleſſe that which is called the court of the Prieſts, 2 Chron. 4.9. but here called <hi>the inner Court,</hi> in reſpect to that greater Court of the people, which was without this; but concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe rowes of Stone and Cedar, the opinion of Expoſitours is very different; for ſome underſtand it of a low wall raiſed about this Court, not above three cubits high (over which the people might looke and ſee their ſacrifices offered by the prieſts on the altar of burnt offering, which was in this Court) made of three rowes of ſtone, perhaps of ſeverall kinds and colours, and a row of Cedar beames on the top. Againe, others underſtand it of a faire building about this Court, wherein were foure galleries, three of ſtone, and one of Cedar; which may ſeeme moſt probable, firſt, becauſe this phraſe (<hi>he built the inner Court</hi>) ſeemes to imply more then the raiſing of a low wall: and ſecondly, becauſe in 1 Chron. 28.11.12. it ſeemes apparent, that there were chambers and treaſuries about the Courts of the Temple. <hi>Then David gave to Solomon his ſonne, the pattern of the porch, and of the houſes thereof, and of the treaſuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy-ſeat. And the pattern of all that he had by the ſpirit, of the Courts of the houſe of the Lord, and of all the Chambers round about, of the treaſuries of the houſe of God, and of the treaſuries of the dedicate things:</hi> and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion we have concerning the Temple, Ezra 6.43.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>BUt Solomon was building his own houſe thirteen yeares.]</hi> Almoſt therefore twice as long was he in building his own houſe as in building the Temple, for he was but ſeven yeares building that, Chap. 6.38. the reaſons whereof may be, firſt, that David had before his death provided a great part of the materialls for the Temple in a readineſſe: ſecondly, that neither Solomon, nor his workemen were ſo forward and zealous for the haſtening and finiſhing theſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as for that of the Temple: and thirdly, that happely this was a far greater build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as indeed we may the better think it was, if we reckon the houſe of Lebanon and the Queens houſe as part of this royall palace, as moſt interpreters upon very probable grounds conceive they were.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>He built alſo the houſe of the forreſt of Lebanon,</hi> &amp;c.] Many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours hold, that this <hi>houſe of the forreſt of Lebanon,</hi> was no part of that houſe of Solomons, mentioned in the foregoing verſe, which was thirteen years in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but another houſe which he built in the forreſt of Lebanon, after thoſe twenty yeares were expired that were ſpent in building the houſe of the Lord, and his own houſe, Chap, 9.10. to wit, when Solomon had taken Hamath, 2 Chron. 8.3. which was the royall citie they ſay of Libanus: and for the further confirmation of this, they alledge that place, Chap. 9.19. where it is ſaid, that Solomon built all that he <hi>deſired to build in Jeruſalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominions;</hi> but yet the moſt of Interpreters, and I think moſt probably, doe hold the contrary, namely, that it was a part of the Kings houſe which was thirteen years in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and that for theſe reaſons; firſt, becauſe there the golden Targets and Shields were kept, which Solomon made, Chap. 10.17. <hi>the King put them in the houſe of the forreſt of Lebanon;</hi> and were thence taken by Shiſhak, when he came up againſt Jeruſalem, Chap. 14.25.26. and doubtleſſe, theſe were provided to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the King by his Guard, as were thoſe of braſſe which Rehoboam made in ſtead of the golden ones, which the King of Egypt had carried away. Chap. 14.28. and therefore could not be ſo farre off as mount Lebanon was: ſecondly, becauſe it ſeemes to have beene the chiefe ſtore-houſe and magazine of Armes which the kings of Judah had, whence is that Eſay 22.8. <hi>Thou didst looke in that day to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the houſe of the forreſt,</hi> and it is not likely, that Solomon would have his chiefe Magazine of Armes in mount Lebanon, which was in the very utmoſt parts of his kingdome: thirdly, becauſe it is not probable, that Hiram afforded not help, both of materials and builders for this houſe of Lebanon, as well as for the reſt of Solomons buildings, and it is manifeſt, Chap. 9.10.11. that Solomon gave Hiram his recompence, at the end of thoſe thirteen yeers ſpent in building his own houſe, when as it is ſaid there, verſe 1. <hi>Solomon had finiſhed the building of the houſe of the Lord, and the Kings houſe, and all Solomons deſire which he was pleaſed to doe:</hi> fourthly, becauſe his throne of Judgement (which we may well think was in Jeruſalem) was in a part of this houſe, as we ſee in the ſeventh verſe of this Chapter: and fifthly, becauſe his wives houſe, which is alſo here ſeverally mentioned, was a part of his owne houſe, as appeareth, 1 Kings. 3.1. <hi>And Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon made affinitie with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tooke Pharoahs daughter, and

brought her into the citie of David, untill he had made an end of of building his own houſe,</hi> &amp;c. under which, the Queens houſe muſt needs be comprehended, and why not then the houſe of Lebanon alſo? and therefore it is thought to have been called the houſe of the forreſt of Lebanon: firſt, becauſe of the multitude of Cedar pillars which were therein brought from Lebanon, it ſhewed like a forreſt of Cedar trees: ſecondly, becauſe in regard of the pleaſantneſſe of it, having many curious ſhadowy groves, and green cloſes about it, it did reſemble the forreſt of mount Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon: and thirdly, becauſe it was made of Cedars brought from Lebanon; as in the ſame regard alſo (according to the expoſition of many interpreters) the Temple is alſo called Lebanon, Zach. 11.1. <hi>Open thy doores O Lebanon, that the fire may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure thy Cedars.</hi>

                     <hi>And the height thereof thirty cubits, upon foure rows of Cedar pillars, with Cedar beams upon the pillars,</hi> &amp;c.] It is very hard to conceive the faſhion of the building of this houſe, by this ſhort deſcription which we here have of it, eſpecially becauſe here it is ſaid, that it ſtood <hi>upon foure rows of Cedar pillars, with Cedar beams upon the pillars,</hi> and it followes in the next verſe, <hi>And it was covered with Cedar above upon the beams, that lay on fourty five pillars, fifteen in a row,</hi> for if there were <hi>foure rows of pillars,</hi> as here it is ſaid, and fifteen in a row, as verſ. 3. then ſhould there be, may ſome ſay, threeſcore pillars and not fourty five, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly there ſaid: but the moſt probable conjectures that I find in Expoſitours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the contriving of this building, according to the deſcription that is here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it, are theſe two; the firſt is, that it was built with three ſtories, in the firſt whereof, which was next to the ground, there were <hi>foure rows of Cedar pillars,</hi> which are thoſe here mentioned; <hi>and the Cedar beams upon the pillars,</hi> were thoſe which were laid for the floore of the ſecond ſtorie; then in the ſecond ſtorie there was <hi>fourty five pillars, fifteen in a row,</hi> ſo that there was not in this ſtorie foure rows of pillars, as there was in that next the ground, but three rows, fifteen in a row, which makes fourty five pillars; and over theſe, there were alſo beams laid, which were for the floore of the third ſtorie, which had no beams, but a roofe of Cedar on the top, all which they ſay, is comprehended in thoſe words, verſe 3. <hi>And it was covered with Cedar above upon the beams, that lay on fourty five pillars, fifteen in a row:</hi> the ſecond is, that this houſe was built with three galleries on each ſide, one over the other, each one borne up with two rows of pillars, whereof one row joyned to the wall of the houſe on either ſide, and the other ſtood on the outſide of the Galleries on either ſide the houſe, and that theſe were the foure rows of pillars mentioned in this verſe, where it is ſaid, that the houſe ſtood <hi>upon foure rows of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar pillars, with Cedar beams upon the pillars,</hi> and that in the next verſe it is ſaid, that <hi>it was covered with Cedar above upon the beams, that lay on fourty five pillars, fifteen in a row,</hi> becauſe, there the outmoſt pillars are only counted on one ſide of the houſe, whereof there were fifteen in a row, in each of the three Galleries, one over the other, which makes in all fourty five pillars, each Gallery having beams of Cedar upon the pillars, and thoſe alſo covered with Cedar boards. However, that this houſe was provided not only for ſtore-houſes, but alſo for publick feaſts, and for a ſummer houſe, happely for the king to dwell in at times, we may gather from that place, chap. 10.21. <hi>All king Solomons drinking veſſells were of gold,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:42229:247"/>
and all the veſſels of the houſe of the forreſt of Lebanon were of pure gold,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And there were windows in three rows, and light was againſt light in three ranks.]</hi> The meaning of this may be either, that the windows in each of the three galleries on one ſide of the houſe, were right againſt the windows on the other ſide; or elſe, that as the windows ſtood ſide wayes in even rows, ſo alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly they were one directly over the other.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And all the doores and posts were ſquare, with the windows.]</hi> That is, both doores and poſts, and windows were all ſquare.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And he made a porch of pillars, the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits.]</hi> It was therefore in length anſwerable to the breadth of the houſe, and the breadth of it thirty cubits, being added to the length of the houſe, made the houſe (porch and all) one hundred and thirty cubits long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the porch was before them, and the other pillars, and the thick beam were before them.]</hi> That is, the porch beneath was before the doores, and poſts of the houſe mentioned verſ. 5. the walls and pillars of the porch being every way correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to thoſe in the houſe; and then upon theſe pillars in the porch were beams laid, which did ſupport other pillars above, as it was in the houſe, verſ. 2.3. and ſo the beams, and upper pillars in the porch, were right againſt the beams and upper pillars in the houſe; and thus alſo the height of the porch is alſo implyed to have been the ſame with the height of the houſe, which was not before expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Then he made a porch for the throne, where he might judge,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, for the throne of Ivory, which is largely deſcribed, chap. 10.18. the joyning of this we ſee here, with that which went before, makes it probable, that this was built in the ſame place, though not juſt before the houſe of Lebanon, but before that part where the king uſually dwelt, onely there was a court between, to which the words in the following verſe ſeem to have reference.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And his houſe where he dwelt, had another court within the porch, which was of the like work.]</hi> Hereby it appears, that the porch of judgement ſpoken of in the verſe before, was not juſt before the kings dwelling houſe, to wit, as joyning to it, for within that porch, was the court of the houſe of the like work, that is, having porches and galleries about it, as that had; as alſo that without that porch of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was a great court, where the people met, that came thither for matters of juſtice, for what court elſe ſhould this be referred to, where it is ſaid, that the kings houſe <hi>had another court,</hi> within the porch, which is therefore called the middle court, 2. Kings 20.4. <hi>Iſaiah was gone into the middle court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon made alſo an houſe for Pharaohs daughter,</hi> &amp;c.] Concerning which, ſee 2. Chron. 8.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>All theſe were of coſtly ſtones,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby it is evident that the walls of all theſe buildings before mentioned, were of ſtone, to wit, coſtly ſtones, Marble, and Porphyrie, &amp;c. though the pillars and galleries were of cedar, as is before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the walls alſo within doubtleſſe covered with cedar; yea and though they were ſuch coſtly ſtones, yet were they <hi>according to the meaſure of hewed ſtones,</hi> as great, that is every way as great, as other ordinary hewed ſtones, <hi>even from the foundation unto the coping,</hi> that is, the top of the wall, whereon the beams were laid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſo on the outſide toward the great court.]</hi> That is, the court that
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:42229:248"/>
did compaſſe about, or lay as a great court-yard before all theſe buildings.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 12. <hi>And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed ſtones,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the great court mentioned verſ. 9. and whereas it is ſaid, that it was <hi>with three rows of hewed ſtones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the houſe of the Lord, and for the porch of the houſe,</hi> the meaning is, either that it was built about with three ſtories of ſtone building, and one ſtory of cedar, both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the court of the houſe of the Lord, and towards the porch of the kings houſe; or elſe, that as the inner court of the Temple was built with three rows of hewed ſtones, and a row of cedar beams (concerning which, ſee the note, chap. 6.36. ſo was alſo this that lay before the porch of the kings pallace.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>He was a widows ſonne of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre,</hi> &amp;c.] This Hiram 2. Chron. 2.14. is ſaid to have been <hi>the ſonne of a woman, of the daughters of Dan,</hi> yet here it is ſaid, that he was <hi>a widows ſonne of the tribe of Naphtali,</hi> to wit, becauſe his father was of that tribe (though his mother was of the tribe of Dan, 2. Chron. 2.14. and withall it is ſaid, that <hi>his father was a man of Tyre,</hi> either becauſe ſome skilfull Tyrian that taught him his skill, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted him for his ſonne; or rather, becauſe his father had long inhabited that place: yet ſome rather conceive, that his mother is here ſaid to have been of the tribe of Naphtali, and that it was the errour of the king to ſay ſhe was of the tribe of Dan, as we ſee he did, 2. Chron. 2.14. Now though here it is onely ſaid, that he was a worker in braſſe, yet he was alſo <hi>skilfull to work in gold and in ſilver, in iron, in ſtone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, in fine linnen, and in crimſon: alſo to grave any manner of graving, to find out every device,</hi> &amp;c. as is expreſſed in that 2. Chron. 2.14. ſo that Solomon out of the great reſpect he bore him, uſed to call him his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 2. Chron. 4.16. <hi>All their inſtruments did Hiram his father make to king Solomon, for the houſe of the Lord, of bright braſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>For he caſt two pillars of braſſe, of eighteen cubits high a piece.]</hi> In 2. Chron. 3.15. it is ſaid, that theſe pillars were <hi>thirty five cubits high,</hi> which ſeeming difference is three ſeverall wayes reconciled by Interpreters: firſt, that here is ſet down the complete length of the pillars, even the baſis or pedeſtal of the pillars, being reckoned in, but according to the account of the ſacred cubit, or the cubit of the Sanctuary, which contained two common cubits: but in the Chronicles the length of them is reckoned according to the common cubit, onely the baſis is left out, and ſo they are ſaid to be thirty five cubits long, and ſo (ſhould the baſe have been added) there had been thirty ſix cubits, twice as many as in this place, where the length is taken according to the ſacred cubit: ſecondly, that here the length of one pillar is ſet down, and in the Chronicles the length of both together; and whereas againſt this it might be objected, that one pillar being eighteen cubits long, the length of both muſt need be thirty ſix cubits, not thirty five, as it is in the Chronicles; to this, two anſwers are given: firſt, that happely the pillars were but ſeventeen cubits and a half high, a piece (which being put together, make thirty five cubits) but are ſaid here to be eighteen cubits high, becauſe it is uſuall in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, not to expreſſe ſuch broken meaſures, but rather to expreſſe it in a full number: and ſecondly, that happely each pillar was eighteen cubits high, but half a cubit of each pillar being within the chapiters that were put upon them, being ſo meaſured,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42229:248"/>
they made together but thirty five cubits: and thirdly, that the Scapus or body of each pillar was but eighteen cubits high, but that the baſe, the chapiters, and all other the additions and appurtenances of the pillars being meaſured in, they were indeed thirty five cubits high, and indeed this laſt ſeems to me the plaineſt and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable anſwer, and leaſt lyable to exceptions; yet any of them are probable enough, and ſufficient to remove the ſeeming contradiction betwixt theſe two places; in Jer. 52.21. it is alſo added, that theſe pillars were hollow and foure fingers thick.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>The height of the one chapiter was five cubits.]</hi> In 2. Kings 25.17. it is ſaid, that the chapiters were but three cubits high; but there by the chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are meant onely <hi>the pomels of</hi> the chapiters, as they are called, 2, Chron. 4.12. which were indeed but three cubits high, but here the net-work which ether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed thoſe pomels and ſtood hollow from the pomels, or elſe were as a freez above the pomels are alſo comprehended, and ſo theſe chapiters were five cubits high; and foure cubits in height they were with lillie-work, verſ. 19, yet ſome hold, it was the cornice on the top that was three cubits high, 2. Kings 25.17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of certain borders, ſome of checker-work wrought after the manner of nets, and others of chain-work, which were on the lower part of the chapiters, or in the midſt as a freez; but others conceive that the bowls of each chapiter were compaſſed within theſe nets of braſſe, and that theſe ſeven wreaths of chain did in ſeverall places compaſſe the net which was faſtened to theſe wreaths, for the better ſtrengthening of them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one net-work to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with pomegranates.]</hi> Some undeſtand this alſo, of two borders made with pomegranates an hundred in each border, or row, which were above the borders of net-work, and wreaths of chain-work; others rather think, that theſe two borders went round about on the outſide of the grates and chain-wreaths, from which the pomegranates did hang down in the midſt of the open ſpaces in the net-work.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of lilie-work in the porch foure cubits.]</hi> That is, they were made in leaves after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lilies, foure cubits high, and it was ſuch lilie-work as was in the porch, before which theſe pillars ſtood: ſee the note above, verſ. 16. But yet ſome referre this, <hi>in the porch,</hi> to <hi>pillars,</hi> not to <hi>lilie-work,</hi> as if it had been thus expreſſed, <hi>And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lilie-work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates alſo above,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, that in the upper part of the chapiters, which is called the cornice, right over above the belly which was by the net-work, which is above called the freez, there were alſo pomegranates; now whereas it follows concerning the number of the pomegranates, <hi>and the pomegranates were two hundred,</hi> &amp;c. for this we muſt know, that there were two rows or borders, as is noted before, verſ. 18. above the net-work wreaths in each chapiter, now there being a hundred pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates hanging down from each of theſe rows or borders, which are thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, 2. Chron. 3.16. <hi>And he made an hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains,</hi> there were conſequently two hundred pomegranates upon the freez of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:42229:249"/>
each chapiter, as it is here ſaid, and in the chapiters of both pillars foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as is noted, verſ. 42. of this chapter, and again 2. Chron. 4.13. Indeed, Jer. 52.23. it is ſaid, that there were but <hi>Ninety and ſix pomegranates on a ſide,</hi> that is, on one of the rows; but then it ſeems there were eight other pomegranates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween checker and checker, which made up the two rows of ninety ſix full two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and thence it is, that even in that place of Jeremy before cited, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that all the pomegranates in one row were an hundred, <hi>there were ninety and ſix on a ſide, and all the pomegranates upon the net-work, were an hundred round about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And he ſet up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin,</hi> &amp;c.] The two pillars the one called <hi>Jachin,</hi> that is, <hi>he ſhall eſtabliſh:</hi> the other called <hi>Boaz,</hi> that is, <hi>in it is ſtrength:</hi> ſignified, firſt, the ſtrength and ſtabilitie of the temple, even that God would preſerve and uphold it in caſe the people would keep covenant with him: ſecondly, the invincible ſtrength and ſtabilitie of the church whereof the temple was a ſigne, and that her ſtrength ſhould be merely of God: thirdly, the certain perſeverance of every true believer through Gods help and ſupport, who will never ſuffer the gates of hell utterly to prevail againſt them: and fourthly, that God would in all ages raiſe up ſome in his church, Martyrs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, and others, that ſhould as farre excell others in all eminencie of grace as theſe pillars did excell the reſt of the building in curious workmanſhip; men that ſhould be the glory of the churches whereof they are members, and that by their courage, conſtancie and patience, ſhould notably ſtrengthen and ſupport others, whence it is, that Saint John ſpeaking of thoſe that ſhould continue conſtant in times of perſecution, as alluding to theſe two pillars, ſaith of them, <hi>Him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And he made a molten ſea,</hi> &amp;c.] At this the prieſts were to waſh their hands and feet, for ſo it is expreſſed, 2. Chron. 4.6. <hi>The ſea was for the prieſts to waſh in,</hi> as formerly they had done at the laver in the tabernacle, Exod. 30.19, 20, 21. (concerning which, ſee the note there,) and hence we may gather, that it had pipes or cocks to let out the water; it was called a ſea, becauſe it was ſuch a huge veſſel, <hi>ten cubits,</hi> that is, five yards <hi>from the</hi> one brim to the other, and <hi>five cubits,</hi> that is two yards and a half <hi>high;</hi> and this was to ſignifie both the exceeding filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, that would require a ſea for the cleanſing of it; and alſo the infinite virtue there had need to be in the bloud, whereby the ſinne of all Gods elect people muſt be waſhed away: the reaſon why not onely the breadth of it is expreſſed, but alſo the meaſure of the circumference of it round, <hi>a line of thirty cubits,</hi> that is, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yards <hi>did compaſſe it round about,</hi> is to intimate, that it was exactly round, for the diameter of a circumference is the third part of the circumference and a little more, and ſo it was here, it was thirty cubits round in compaſſe, and ſo the diameter of it from brim to brim was <hi>ten cubits,</hi> and perhaps a little more, which is not therefore expreſſed. In the Chronicles there is alſo mention of the braſen altar which Hiram made, which is not here ſet down, 2. Chron. 4.1. <hi>Moreover he made an altar of braſſe, twenty cubits the length thereof,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And under the brim of it round about, there were knops compaſſing
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:42229:249"/>
it, ten in a cubit,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, under the lilie work of the brim there were knops, ten in a cubit, to wit, <hi>three hundred knops, caſt in two rows</hi> (for the ſea was thirty cubits in compaſſe) and out of each of theſe knops there did iſſue forth, as it were, the figure of an Oxe-head (out of which perhaps the water did run) 2 Chron. 4.3.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>It contained two thouſand baths.]</hi> That is, ſo much water was uſually put into it, but it held, if filled up to the brim, three thouſand baths, 2 Chro. 4.5. And if a bath contained eight gallons or thereabout, as is uſually held, then foure baths made a barrell, and conſequently, there was uſually put into this ſea five hundred barrels of water, and if filled up to the brim, it could contain ſeven hundred and fifty barrels. If this anſwer doth not ſatisfie, we muſt yield that the meaſure of the bath differed, and that the biggeſt held an ordinary bath and an half, whence is the ſeeming contradiction of theſe two places.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And he made ten baſes of braſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Whereon the ten lavers ſtood, ver. 38. and whereon they were drawn from place to place, as occaſion ſerved, for the waſhing of the ſacrifices, 2 Chron. 4.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>They had borders, and the borders were between the ledges,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the baſe being made like a cheſt of foure brazen tables, foure cubits long, and three cubits high, joyned in the corners to foure pillaſters, in the upper part of each ſide, which was above the wheels, there were ledge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>And beneath the lyons and oxen were certain additions of thin work.]</hi> That is, certaine finiſhings or ornaments of thin work, which were not of the body of the baſe, but hung down beneath the bottom of the baſe, betwixt the two wheels, and therefore called additions, and happely they are ſaid to have been beneath the lyons and the oxen, (not the Cherubims) becauſe the Cherubims ſtood outmoſt on each ſide, and ſo were over the wheels, and then the lyons and the oxen being in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the ſide boards, beneath them the additions were.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And every baſe had foure brazen wheels, and plates of braſſe.]</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough which the ends of the axletrees went on each ſide, and whereon they were born up,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the foure corners thereof had underſetters.]</hi> From each corner of this baſe there roſe up certaine ſtrong ſtayes or underſetters, whereon the belly of the laver did reſt, that ſo, when the baſe was ſtirred, it might ſtand faſt and firm; and theſe underſetters are ſaid to be at the ſide of every addition; either with reſpect to thoſe additions beneath mentioned, verſe 29. that hung down between the wheels, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that theſe underſetters were certain pillaſters, the lower part whereof was in the bottom of the baſe, by the ſide of thoſe additions, or elſe rather, with reſpect unto thoſe additions that were on the upper edge of the baſe, for as there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain finiſhings, and trimming ornaments on the lower edge of the baſe, hanging

downe betweene the wheeles, whereof there is mention, verſe 29. ſo alſo it ſeemes there were the like, or other additions or ornaments, on the upper edge of the baſe, whereof mention is made, verſe 36. and at the ſide of theſe additions in each cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the baſe were theſe underſetters, whereon the laver reſting, was kept ſteady.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit,</hi> &amp;c.] For the underſtanding of this, we muſt know, that in the midſt of the cover or lid of theſe baſes, there did riſe up another leſſer baſe, about halfe a cubit high, which is here called the <hi>chapiter,</hi> from the lid or cover of the great baſe, it did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend foure ſquare, and ſtreight up halfe a cubit, and thence afterwards it did aſcend with a round compaſſe, ſtill growing wider and wider, like the mouth of a funnell, for halfe a cubit more (as is expreſſed, verſe 35. <hi>in the top of the baſe was there a round compaſſe of half a cubit high</hi>) that ſo in the mouth or hollow thereof, the lower part of the lavers might reſt: now of this it is here ſaid, <hi>that the mouth of it within the chapiter,</hi> that is, within the lower part that went ſtraight up, <hi>and above,</hi> that is, in that part which went up with a round compaſſe on the top, <hi>it was a cubit,</hi> that is, a cubit high; the round compaſſe in the top whereinto the Lavers were ſet, was half a cubit high, verſe 35. and the chapiter or baſe beneath was alſo it ſeemes halfe a cubit high, and therefore both together were a cubit in height, and then for the circumference, as it followeth in the next words, <hi>the mouth thereof was round, after the work of the baſe, a cubit and an half,</hi> that is, it was round in compaſſe a cubit and an half, and made after the work of the baſe with borders, and ledges, and gravings, to wit, of Cherubims and lyons, &amp;c. in the borders; which were as thoſe in the baſe, foure ſquare, not round. Some Expoſitours do indeed otherwiſe underſtand theſe words; namely, that the mouth of this baſe was a cubit broad from one ſide to the other, in that part of it, which was encompaſſed with a crowne or cornice, called here the chapiter; but the firſt expoſition is the beſt.</p>

As for the allotting of a candleſtick to every table to give light thereto, it might alſo ſignifie, that unleſſe light from above goes along with every Ordinance, appointed for the feeding of mens ſouls, it will be to them of no advantage.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen Solomon aſſembled the Elders of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to attend upon the ark, when it was removed <hi>out of the City of David, which is Zion,</hi> (where it had been ever ſince David brought it thither, 2 Sam. 6.12, of which, ſee the note there) unto the Temple which Solomon had now built in mount Moriah; for by this perſonall attendance both of Princes and people upon the ark, they did acknowledge the Lord, of whoſe preſente the ark was a type, to be the God and Lord of Iſrael, and themſelves his ſervants. A great queſtion, indeed it is, how it can be ſaid here, that the ark was carried out of Sion, that it might be placed in the Temple, ſeeing ordinarily in the Scripture, Sion is ſpoken of as the place where God dwelt in his Temple amongſt his people, as Pſal. 78.68.69. where it is ſaid, that <hi>God choſe the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved, and he built his Sanctuary like high places,</hi> &amp;c. and Eſa. 8.18. where God is called <hi>the Lord of hosts, that dwelleth in mount Zion,</hi> and ſo in many other places. But for this
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:42229:251"/>
we muſt know that to ſpeak properly and in a ſtrict ſence, the Temple was not built in mount Sion but in mount Moriah, 2. Chron. 3.1. therefore it is ſaid here, that the ark was carried <hi>out of the citie of David, which is Zion,</hi> into the Temple; but becauſe the whole citie of Jeruſalem is uſually called Sion, and mount Sion, from that mount which was a chief part of it, thence it is that the Temple Gods dwelling place, is ſo uſually ſaid to have been in Sion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And all the men of Iſrael aſſembled themſelves unto king Solomon at the feast,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, at the time when they were from all parts of the land to aſſemble themſelves together to keep the feaſt, <hi>in the moneth of Ethanim, which is the ſeventh moneth.</hi> By the feaſt is meant (as is moſt probably held by the moſt of Interpreters) the feaſt of tabernacles, which began the 15 day of the ſeventh moneth, Levit. 23.34. and was indeed the chief feaſt of this moneth, as being one of thoſe three feaſts whereto all the males of Iſrael were bound to reſort: yet it muſt needs be that the people aſſembled (at leaſt the heads of the tribes, and the chief of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) ſeven or eight dayes before the feaſt of tabernacles, for the feaſt of tabernacles was kept from the fifteenth to the end of the two and twentieth day; and on the three and twentieth day Solomon diſmiſſed the people, 2. Chron. 7.10. <hi>And on the three and twentieth day of this ſeventh moneth, he ſent the people away unto their tents,</hi> ſo that the ſeven dayes, which he kept for the dedication of the temple (whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made verſ. 65. of this chapter, and 2. Chron. 7.9.) were before the feaſt of tabernacles: yet if they were the ſeven dayes immediately foregoing the feaſt of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, which was on the fifteenth day of the moneth, doubtleſſe the tenth day was excepted, which was the day wherein they afflicted their ſouls with faſting, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 23.27. and therefore not likely to have been one of the dayes of this feſtivitie of the Temples dedication: now whereas it may be objected, that till the eight moneth the Temple was not finiſhed, chap. 6.38. <hi>And in the eleventh yeare, in the moneth Bul (which is the eight moneth) was the houſe finiſhed;</hi> to this I anſwer that the dedication therefore was, doubtleſſe in the ſeventh moneth of the following yeare, that moneth being choſen for the peoples convenience, who were then to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelves to keep the feaſt of Tabernacles, and that in the interim there might be time for the drying of the walls, and to make all things ready for the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the prieſts took up the ark.]</hi> In 2. Chron. 5.4. it is, <hi>and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites took up the ark:</hi> but that is onely, becauſe the prieſts alſo were of the tribe of Levi.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And they brought up the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that which was made by Moſes, which onely was called the tabernacle of the congregation, this had been hitherto in Gibeon, 2. Chron. 1.3. but was now removed thence with all the holy veſſels thereof, and laid up in the treaſuries of the Temple: not onely becauſe they had been conſecrated to God, but alſo to make ſure that the Temple ſhould now be the onely place of Gods worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Sacrificing ſheep and oxen that could not be told, nor numbred for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.]</hi> To wit, when they were going in a ſolemn manner before the ark, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it from the citie of David into the Temple, and therefore perhaps in the ſame manner too that was obſerved by David, when he removed the ark from the houſe
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:42229:251"/>
of Obed Edom, 2. Sam. 6.13. <hi>And it was ſo, that when they that bare the ark of the Lord, had gone ſix paces, he ſacrificed oxen and fatlings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And they drew out the ſtaves, that the ends of the ſtaves were ſeen out in the holy place,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive the meaning of this hard place is this, to wit, that they drew out the ſtaves quite out of the rings of the ark, thereby to ſignifie, that the ark was now to be removed no more, and ſo the ſtaves being laid upon the ground in the fore part of the Sanctuary, their foure ends, or heads, might be ſeen as one went out of the holy place, into the moſt holy; but out of that place they were never ſeen, becauſe the ark was never removed; but it is hard to make this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition agree with the words: the moſt approved expoſition therefore is this, when they had ſet the ark in his place, behind the Cherubims, to wit, the two great Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims which Solomon had made, neither the ark nor the ſtaves could be ſeen; but then they drew out the ſtaves eaſtward, that ſo though the ark was not ſeen, yet the end of the ſtaves might be ſeen, to put them in mind of the ark which was behind the wings of the Cherubims: for by this means <hi>the ends of the ſtaves were ſeen out in the holy place before the oracle,</hi> that is, in that part of the moſt holy place which was before the ark (which was more eſpecially called <hi>the oracle) and they were not ſeen without,</hi> that is, they were not ſeen out of the ark: they that were before the oracle in the moſt holy place, might diſcern by the ends of the ſtaves, that they were in the ark, as it is expreſſed, 2. Chron. 5.9. <hi>And they drew out the ſtaves of the ark, that the ends of the ſtaves were ſeen from the ark before the oracle:</hi> but the ſtaves were never ſeen out of the ark, for that was againſt Gods Law, Exod. 25.15. <hi>The ſtaves ſhall be in the rings of the ark, they ſhall not be taken from it;</hi> or elſe, <hi>they were not ſeen without,</hi> that is, the ſtaves were drawn out ſo little, that in the moſt holy place they might be diſcerned; or happely, at the very doore where they went out of the moſt holy place into the Temple, but further out in the Temple they could not be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>There was nothing in the ark, ſave the two tables of ſtone.]</hi> For though the pot of Manna, Exod. 16.34. and Aarons rod, Numb. 17.10. and the book of the Law, Deut. 31.26. were laid up before the ark; yet they were not put into the ark, as were the two tables of ſtone; and accordingly we muſt underſtand that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.3, 4. <hi>And after the ſecond vail, the tabernacle which is called the holieſt of all: Which had the golden cenſer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had Manna, and Aarons rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And it came to paſſe when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the houſe of the Lord.]</hi> When the prieſts had ſet the ark in his place, and were come out, immediately there were an hundred and twenty prieſts with trumpets, and the Levite-ſingers ſtanding at the eaſt end of the altar with their Cymballs, Pſalteries and Harps, appointed to ſound forth the praiſes of God, and whileſt they were thus employed, ſuddenly the houſe of the Lord was filled with a cloud, ſo that the prieſts were not able to miniſter, no not in the court where the braſen altar ſtood, for thus it is expreſſed, 2. Chron. 5.11. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Then ſpake Solomon, The Lord ſaid that he would dwell in the thick darkneſſe.]</hi> Solomon ſtanding where he ſaw how on a ſudden the houſe was filled
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:42229:252"/>
with a cloud, (to wit, upon the braſen ſcaffold that was built for him in the outward court, which was therefore it ſeems right before the door of the prieſts court, through which he might look, 2 Chron. 6.13. <hi>For Solomon had made a braſen ſcaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had ſet it in the midſt of the court, and upon it he ſtood,</hi> &amp;c.) apprehending rightly, that it was ſent of God as a ſigne of his preſence; in that rapture of his joy, he brake forth into theſe following words, <hi>the Lord ſaid that he would dwell in the thick darkneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the Lord hath ſaid, he would appear in a cloud, Levit. 16.2. <hi>I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy ſeat:</hi> and by a cloud he hath uſually teſtified his preſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his people; as in the leading of the Iſraelites by a cloud, Exod, 13.21. in the thick cloud that was upon mount Sinai at the giving of the law, Exod. 19, 16. in the cloud that covered and filled the tabernacle, ſo ſoon as it was reared up by Moſes, Exod. 40.34. and therefore ſaith Solomon, doubtleſſe by this cloud the Lord doth ſhew us, that he hath favourably accepted our ſervice in building this houſe, and that he hath taken it to be the ſettled place wherein he will abide for ever.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the king turned his face about, and bleſſed all the congregation of Iſrael.]</hi> For hitherto he had ſtood with his face toward the altar, obſerving what was done at the carrying in of the ark.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Since the day that I brought forth my people Iſrael out of Egypt, I choſe no city out of all the tribes of Iſrael to build an houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] See this more fully expreſſed, 2. Chron. 6.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Thou didst well that it was in thine heart.]</hi> See the notes 2 Sam. 7.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Solomon ſtood before the altar of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving turned himſelf from the people, he ſtood upon the braſen ſcaffold, with his face toward the altar, and then kneeling down upon his knees, as is expreſſed, verſ. 54. and 2. Chron. 6.13. he lift up his hands towards heaven, and ſo prayed unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Therefore now, Lord God of Iſrael, keep with thy ſervant David my father that thou promiſedſt him.]</hi> That is, ſeeing <hi>thou haſt kept with thy ſervant David my father that thou promiſedſt him,</hi> in raiſing me his ſon up to build a Temple for thee, <hi>therefore now</hi> alſo <hi>keep with thy ſervant David my father that thou promiſedſt him, ſaying; There ſhall not fail thee a man in my ſight to ſit upon the throne of Iſrael.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Behold, the heaven, and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee.]</hi> See the note Deut. 10.14.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And hearken thou to the ſupplication of thy ſervant, and of thy people Iſrael, when they ſhall pray towards this place.]</hi> Or, <hi>in this place,</hi> as it is in the margin; even herein, as in other things, was this Temple a type of Chriſt. As the prayers of Gods people, were the more accepted of God, when they prayed in the Temple, or, but with their faces towards the Temple; ſo are now the prayers of Gods righteous ſervants accepted of God, becauſe they are put up in Chriſts name, with an eye of faith fixt upon him as their Mediatour, Joh. 14.13, 14. <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in my name, that I will do,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when thou heareſt, forgive.]</hi> This clauſe is added, firſt, becauſe pardon of ſin is the chief thing to be begged of God in all our prayers, for hereby a way is made
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:42229:252"/>
for the obtaining of other bleſſings, and beſides, there is no true comfort in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any bleſſing, if our ſins ſhould ſtill remain unforgiven: and ſecondly, becauſe the beſt are ſubject to ſo many failings in prayer, that ſhould not the Lord pardon the ſin of their prayers, there would be no hope that any prayer of theirs ſhould do them good.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>If any man treſpaſſe againſt his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, if a man be charged that he hath treſpaſſed againſt his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and be brought before the altar to clear himſelf by oath (as in caſe where ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof and witneſſe was wanting, they uſed to do, Exod. 22.8.11. Numb. 5.12.19.) do thou accordingly deal with the man that takes the oath, puniſhing him if he be faulty, and acquitting him if he be innocent.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>When thy people Iſrael be ſmitten, and ſhall turn again to thee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe thy name,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, thy Juſtice, by laying all the blame upon themſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that they have deſervedly ſuffered; and thy mercy and power, by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee for pardon and ſuccour.</p>
                  <p>Verſ, 34. <hi>And bring them again unto the land which thou gaveſt unto their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.]</hi> This may be meant either of thoſe that were taken priſoners in battel, to wit, that upon the prayers of their brethren in the Temple, or their own prayers towards the Temple, the Lord would be pleaſed to bring them again into the land: or elſe of thoſe, that by the enemy ſhould be driven out of their dwelling places, yet not out of the land of Canaan: to wit, that God would be pleaſed, when they prayed in, or towards the Temple, to hear their prayers, and reſtore them again to the land of their inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>If they pray toward this place, and confeſſe thy name, and turn from their ſinne when thou afflicteſt them,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, though they did not repent and turn unto thee till thine hand was heavie on them, yet let not that hinder the acceptance of their prayers if they do then ſincerely repent, and ſeek thy face and favour.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>Forgive the ſinne of thy ſervants, and of thy people Iſrael, that thou teach them the good way,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added, becauſe firſt, there is no hope of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtruction till ſinne be pardoned; ſecondly, the removing of a judgement yields little comfort, unleſſe men become better then they were before; and thirdly, no chaſtiſement will ever inſtruct men unleſſe God teach them by his ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>What prayer and ſupplication ſoever be made by any man, or by all thy people Iſrael, which ſhall know every man the plague of his own heart,</hi> &amp;c.] By <hi>the plague of the heart,</hi> here is meant both the ſinnes for which they are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which proceed all from the wickedneſſe of the heart, and muſt be acknowledged and bewailed, or elſe men will never ſeek ſeriouſly to God that the puniſhment may be removed; and alſo, the puniſhment it ſelf, becauſe it is inflicted for ſinne, which is rooted in the heart, and doth alwayes oppreſſe and wound, eſpecially when we apprehend it to be an effect of Gods wrath.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. <hi>Moreover, concerning a ſtranger that is not of thy people Iſrael.]</hi> Either this is meant of ſuch ſtrangers as were converted to the Jewiſh Religion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therefore Proſelytes, ſuch as was that Ethiopian Eunuch, Acts 8.27. who had been at Jeruſalem to worſhip; or elſe, of ſuch ſtrangers as were alſo unbelievers,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:42229:253"/>
(for whom the Jews ſay there was a court without, that, where the people of Iſrael met together) Indeed there is no queſtion, but ſtrangers of another religion, by the victories of the Jews, and other diſcoveries of Gods ſpeciall love to them, might be brought to have a reverent opinion of the God of the Hebrews (for this was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall with the heathens as we may ſee in that example of the Philiſtines, 1. Sam. 4.7, 8. and 6.2, 3.) and thereupon might come with their gifts and prayers to the temple; but then doubtleſſe Solomon hoped not that their perſons and prayers ſhould be accepted with God for any ſuch devotion in them (for there was never any way of obtaining favour with God, but onely in and through the Meſſias) but deſired onely that God would make his power known by doing what they ſhould ſo deſire of him, that ſo his name might be rendred the more glorious. Thus this place may be underſtood of infidell ſtrangers; yet I think it is rather meant of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 44. <hi>If thy people go out to battel againſt their enemy, whitherſoever thou ſhalt ſend them,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus he implyeth, that even when they had a commiſſion from God to take up arms, yet they ought by prayer to ſeek Gods aſſiſtance, and withall, that unleſſe the warre was juſt, it would be in vain to ſeek to God for help.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 51. <hi>Thine inheritance, which thou broughteſt forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron.]</hi> Why the Iſraelites are called Gods inheritance, ſee the note, Deut. 32.9. and why Egypt is called a furnace of iron, ſee the note, Deut. 4.20. it implies the heavineſſe of their oppreſſion there, and that it was to purge them, and not to conſume them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 52. <hi>That thy eyes may be open unto the ſupplication of thy ſervant.]</hi> That is, of me thy ſervant, as before, verſ. 28.29, 30.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 54. <hi>And it was ſo, that when Solomon had made an end of praying,</hi> &amp;c.] In 2 Chron. 6.41. ſome particulars are added which here are omitted, to wit, that having ended his prayer, he added theſe words, <hi>Now therefore ariſe, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou and the ark of thy ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. which is a clauſe of the 132. Pſalme verſ. 8.9, 10. and therefore doubtleſſe that Pſalme was made, either by his father David, at his removing of the ark, or elſe by Solomon at this time; and that hereupon fire came down from heaven, and conſumed the burnt offerings, and the ſacrifices, which the Prieſts had then laid upon the altar, whereupon the people bowed themſelves and worſhiped the Lord, 2 Chron. 7.1, 3. Now therefore when the Lord had thus teſtified his preſence and aſſent to Solomons prayers, the King roſe up and bleſſed the people, as in the following words is expreſſed.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 64. <hi>The ſame day did the king hallow the middle of the court,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the middle part of the pavement of the inner Court, to wit, either by offering ſacrifices thereon, or by building many and ſeverall altars there for the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe one altar could not ſuffice for ſuch a multitude of ſacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 65. <hi>Solomon held a feast ſeven dayes, even fourteen dayes.]</hi> That is, ſeven dayes for the dedication of the Temple, which began with the beginning of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the ſeventh moneth, and ended with the end of the fourteenth day, (if the tenth day be accepted, as being the day of their publick faſt, as is above noted,

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>WHen Solomon had finiſhed the building of the houſe of the Lord, and the kings houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Some would have theſe words (<hi>and the kings houſe, and all Solomons deſire which he was pleaſed to doe</hi>) to be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a parentheſis, and that becauſe they would have the meaning of this clauſe to be, that <hi>when Solomon had finiſhed the building of the houſe of the Lord, the Lord appeared to Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. before he had built his own houſe, and his other build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but I ſee no neceſſity at all, why this ſecond apparition of the Lord to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, might not be after all his buildings were finiſhed, as the words in our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do plainly imply. Thirteen years indeed were ſpent in building his own houſe, after the Temple was finiſhed, and ſo long therefore it ſeems it was after the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple, ere the Lord appeared the ſecond time to Solomon, and aſſured him that he had heard his prayer, which he had made at the dedication of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for God would firſt ſettle him in the full glory of his kingdome, and then he takes that opportunity to renew his covenant with him in a ſecond viſion, aſſuring him, that in this glory his kingdome ſhould be continued to his poſterity, in caſe both he and his children would keep covenant with him; and withall threatning, that if they revolted from him, he would leave both them and the Temple and all, and poure forth his wrath and fury upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>The Lord appeared to Solomon the ſecond time,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in a dream by night chap. 3.5. and ſo it is partly expreſſed, 2. Chro. 7.12. <hi>And the Lord appeared unto Solomon by night, and ſaid unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and choſen this place to my ſelf, for a houſe of ſacrifice:</hi> once ſince that viſion in Gibeon we reade, that <hi>the word of the Lord came to Solomon,</hi> chap. 6.11. But that it ſeems was by ſome meſſenger or Prophet ſent to him, for this was the ſecond time the Lord appeared unto him in a viſion, as is here expreſſely noted.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>I have hallowed this houſe which thou haſt built, to put my name there for ever,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, untill the coming of the Meſſiah without interruption. As for that following clauſe, <hi>and my eyes, and mine heart ſhall be there perpetually;</hi> thereby is promiſed, both the Lords carefull preſervation of that houſe in ſucceeding times, and his readineſſe to heare the prayers that were offered to him there, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that he would do this out of his fatherly care over them, and love to them.</p>

                     <pb n="486" facs="tcp:42229:254"/>Verſ. 7. <hi>This houſe which I have hallowed for my name, will I caſt out of my ſight,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I will caſt it out of my protection, as a filthy polluted thing: concerning the following clauſe, <hi>and Iſrael ſhall be a proverb,</hi> &amp;c. ſee the note, Deut. 28.37.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furniſhed Solomon with cedar trees, and firre trees, and with gold.]</hi> To wit, one hundred and twenty talents, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, verſ. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.]</hi> By way of requiting Hirams bountie, in ſupplying him with thoſe thing, mentioned in the former words, or by way of ſatisfying him for thoſe things. It was queſtionleſſe unlawfull for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon to give away any part of the land of Canaan to a ſtrange king, or people; for therein, firſt, there ſhould have been wrong done to that tribe in whoſe lot theſe cities were, who ſhould hereby have been deprived of a part of their inheritance which God had given them: and ſecondly, he ſhould have incroached upon Gods royaltie, who ſtill held the land as his, and onely allowed the Iſraelites to dwell in it as ſojourners, by right derived unto them from him; and to manifeſt this, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it to them, with this condition or proviſo, that it ſhould not be lawfull for any of them to alienate or ſell a way their eſtates for ever, no not to any of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Iſraelites, Levit. 25.23. But how then could Solomon, who yet continued in his uprightneſſe, give away twenty cities in the land of Galilee, to Hiram king of Tyre? I anſwer, either Solomon gave him theſe cities onely that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thence for certain years, till he was ſatisfied for that which was owing him, the tribute or other profits which were thence yearly paid to Solomon; or elſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe cities were not a part of that land which God had of old given for the inheritance of his people, but lay in a tract of ground on the outſide of the borders of Aſher, Joſh. 19.24. betwixt them and mount Libanus, and being now reduced under Solomons dominion, and either now, or afterward, counted as a part of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, to which they were joyned, thence Solomon gave unto Hiram twenty cities. And indeed this anſwer ſeems moſt probable, becauſe upon Hirams refuſing theſe cities, they were repaired and inlarged by Solomon, and certain colonies of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were planted therein, 2 Chron. 8.1, 2. whereas before they were inhabited by the heathen, which, ſome ſay, was the firſt occaſion why Galilee was called <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee of the Gentiles,</hi> Eſa. 9.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And they pleaſed him not.]</hi> That is, he liked them not, becauſe they ſtood in an unfruitfull and mariſh ground: or, becauſe he thought it would be long ere he ſhould thence reap that ſatisfaction he expected from Solomon; and as he miſliked them, ſo it ſeems, he refuſed the profer, and choſe rather to receive ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſome other way: for at this very time, to wit, in the one and twentieth yeare after the foundation of the Temple was laid, Solomon repaired and fortified theſe places which Hiram refuſed, as was before noted from 2 Chron. 8.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And this is the reaſon of the levie which king Solomon raiſed, for to build the houſe of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, for the ſame reaſon, that he had received this aid from Hiram, did he alſo raiſe a levie both of men and money amongſt the people, namely, for to build the houſe of the Lord, and his own houſe, &amp;c. of the levie of men, we reade chap. 5.13. and of the levie of money, that is underſtood (as ſome Expoſitours hold) which we reade 2 Chron. 9.13, 14. And though the
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:42229:254"/>
people yielded willingly to this levie for the Temple, yet when it was ſtill continued for theſe other buildings, it ſeems they grudged at it, as we may gather from what they ſaid to Rehoboam, Chap. 12.4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Millo, and the wall of Jeruſalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo,</hi> &amp;c.] Concerning this Millo, ſee the note 2 Sam. 5.19. either it was now repaired and enlarged by Solomon, or elſe a new one was built in another place. Hazor was in the tribe of Napthali, Joſh. 19.32, 36. the chief citie aforetimes of the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Joſh. 11.1, 10. and Megiddo belonged to Manaſſeh, Joſh. 17.11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer.]</hi> This Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer was a city allotted to the Levites in Ephraims tribe, Joſh. 21.20, 21. yet it had been hitherto it ſeems in the Canaanites poſſeſſion, till perhaps upon ſome diſtaſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Solomon being then buſied in his magnificent buildings, entreated Pharaoh his father in law, to rid him of theſe neighbours, which he accordingly performed, and gave the citie as a preſent for his daughter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether.]</hi> Yea, and Beth-horon the upper alſo, 2 Chron. 8.5. one being here expreſſed for both: this was alſo a citie of the Levites, in the tribe of Ephraim, Joſh. 21.21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Baalath and Tadmor in the wilderneſſe, in the land.]</hi> Baalath was a citie in the tribe of Dan, Joſh. 19.40.44. as for that laſt clauſe of this verſe, (<hi>in the land,</hi>) it may have relation to Tadmor alone, to imply, that it was in the land of Iſrael, though in the utmoſt coaſts thereof; or elſe, to all the towns and cities before mentioned: and is added, to ſhew, that beſides what Solomon built elſewhere, all theſe before mentioned he built or repaired in the land of Canaan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And that which Solomon deſired to build in Jeruſalem, and in Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.]</hi> To wit, in the place where the houſe of Lebanon ſtood, or elſe in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Lebanon, which was on the north bounds of the land of Canaan, for there he might build certain forts or towns, though the houſe of Lebanon were built not far from Jeruſalem, of which, ſee the note, chap. 7.2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Whom the children of Iſrael were not able utterly to deſtroy.</hi> See the note, Joſh. 15.63.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon thoſe did Solomon levie a tribute of bond-ſervice unto this day.]</hi> That is, not onely of money but alſo of perſonall ſervice, and that in more ſervile imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then he would impoſe upon the Iſraelites, fitter for bondmen then for free men, as we may ſee, 2 Chron. 2.18. and hence it was, that the poſteritie of theſe ſtrangers were called <hi>Solomons ſervants,</hi> Ezra 2.55, 58. nor is it neceſſary that we ſhould think, that this was a tranſgreſſion of that law, Deut. 7.2. <hi>And when the Lord thy God ſhall deliver them before thee, thou ſhalt ſmite them, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; thou ſhalt make no covenant with them, nor ſhew mercy to them:</hi> ſince that may be meant onely of the inhabitants that were in the land at their entring firſt into it, not of their poſteritie, eſpecially if the Iſraelites had made peace with them, and much more, if they had embraced the true religion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Theſe were the chief of the officers that were over Solomons work, five hundred and fifty,</hi> &amp;c.] In the fifth chapter of this book, and the ſixteenth verſe, we reade of a far greater number, to wit, of three thouſand and three hundred; but there the ſtorie ſpeaks of thoſe chief officers, which were over the work in mount
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:42229:255"/>
Lebanon, where the materials were prepared for the building of the Temple, and here it ſpeaks onely of thoſe chief officers that had the overſight of thoſe that were imployed at home in building; the greater difficultie is how to reconcile this place with that in the 2 Chron. 8.10. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the chief of King Solomons officers</hi> were but <hi>two hundred and fifty men:</hi> but to this, three anſwers may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; firſt, that there the number of Solomons chief officers of ſtate is expreſſed that bare rule over the people, not as here, of thoſe that were imployed about his buildings: or ſecondly, there only thoſe officers were numbred, which were to take account of the builders, and had the chief command over the work: but that here the maſter builders that had the charge to overſee the reſt, and give direction for the building, which were three hundred, are alſo comprehended: or thirdly, though there were five hundred chief officers, and fifty in a higher rank above them, which were over the five hundred, (all which are here together numbred) yet thoſe five hundred did execute their places by turns, two hundred and fifty at a time, and that therefore there are but two hundred and fifty mentioned, 2 Chron. 8.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And three times in the yeare did Solomon offer burnt offerings,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, at the three great feaſts, the feaſt of unleavened bread, the feaſt of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, and the feaſt of Tabernacles: but under theſe by a Synechdoche, all other parts of Gods worſhip required by the law are comprehended, and therefore in 2 Chron. 8.13. there is mention made alſo of the daily ſacrifices, and of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So he finiſhed the houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, having finiſhed the building of the houſe, he imployed it in thoſe ſervices for which it was appointed, and therefore, 2 Chron. 8.14. it is alſo added, that he appointed the prieſts and Levites to their ſeverall charges, in their courſes, according to the order which David by direction from the Lord had ordained.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And king Solomon made a navie of ſhips in Ezion-geber,</hi> &amp;c.] Though this be here firſt related, yet evident it is, that this navie was ſent forth before the Temple was built, becauſe of the Almug-trees brought home by this navie; <hi>And the king made of the Almug-trees pillars and terriſes for the houſe of the Lord, and harps and pſalteries for ſingers,</hi> chap. 10.12. and 2 Chron. 9.10.11. How Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat attempted to enrich himſelf by ſending out a navie after the ſame manner, as Solomon had done before him, and how he ſped, we may read, Chap. 22.48.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And Hiram ſent in the navie his ſervants,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe the Tyrians that were under Hirams government, were always held the moſt expert ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: neither did Hiram onely afford him mariners, but was alſo at coſt to build certain ſhips in Ezion-geber, where Solomons navie was built that ſhould go along in that voyage with the ſhips of Solomon, for that muſt needs be the meaning of that place, 2 Chron. 8.18. <hi>And Hiram ſent by the hands of his ſervants, ſhips and ſervants that had knowledge of the ſea, and they went with the ſervants of Solomon to Ophir,</hi> and that becauſe Hiram could not ſend ſhips ready built from Tyre, which was in the midland ſea to Ezion-geber, which was in the red ſea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fetching an infinite great compaſſe by ſea, which hath no appearance of likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And they came to Ophir, and fet from thence gold, foure hundred
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:42229:255"/>
and twenty talents,</hi> &amp;c.] Ophir is thought to be in the eaſt Indies, for thither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they might moſt eaſily fail from Ezion-geber, which was in the red ſea; and whereas in 2 Chron. 8.18. we read of foure hundred and fifty talents, it ſeems, that thereof thirty talents, went in expence for the charges of the fleet, and for the wages of the men, or it was the return of the adventure of ſome private perſons, and onely foure hundred and twenty, as here, came clear to the king.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THe Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, concerning the name of the Lord.]</hi> Sheba was a countrey that lay ſouthward and far remote from Jeruſalem, Jer. 6.20. <hi>To what purpoſe cometh there to me incenſe from Sheba, and the ſweet cane from a farre countrey?</hi> and thence this Queen is called by our Saviour <hi>the Queen of the ſouth,</hi> Matth. 12.42. and is ſaid to have come <hi>from the utmoſt parts of the earth, to heare the wiſedome of Solomon:</hi> ſome conceive it to have been in Ethiopia; others more probably in Arabia the happie; however both her ſex &amp; dignitie are noted to ſet forth the noble ſpirit of this Queen, that could leave the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of her court, and take ſuch a tedious and coſtly journey to come to Solomon, being onely led thereto by hearing his fame <hi>concerning the name of the Lord,</hi> that is, concerning Gods love and favour to him, and the ſingular wiſedome wherewith God had endowed him, eſpecially in the things of God, and concerning his zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and the Temple which he had built to his name, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the ſitting of his ſervants, and the attendance of his miniſters and their apparell.]</hi> Amongſt the particulars here mentioned, which it ſeems the Queen of Sheba did principally admire, even <hi>the ſitting of his ſervants, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of his miniſters,</hi> is named for one; and it may be meant either of the ſitting of his councel, when they met together to adviſe about the kings and kingdomes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the attendance of his Nobles and Courtiers upon him; or elſe of the ſitting of his Courtiers at table to eat, and the attendance of his miniſters and ſervants up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; to wit, either becauſe there was ſuch a multitude of his Nobles and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; or becauſe being ſo many, they were all ordered with ſuch admirable wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: they ſat at the tables provided for them, every one according to their place, and were ſerved with admirable pomp and ſtate: and ſo alſo <hi>their apparell,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, which is meant either of the richneſſe and coſtlineſſe of his Courtiers and ſervants attire, or elſe of the robes which his Nobles and Officers wore according to their places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his aſcent, by which he went up unto the houſe of the Lord.]</hi> It ſeems there was an aſcent by ſtairs from the kings palace to the outer court of the Temple; and ſo again afterwards from one court to another, till they came to the houſe of the Lord it ſelf: and indeed becauſe of all Solomons buildings, this is onely particularly expreſſed, as the chief thing the Queen of Sheba admired, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it was done with all poſſible art and coſt: and was one of the moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and gracefull things that belonged to the building; even the pillars on each ſide the ſeverall ſtairs were made of precious wood, as is afterwards expreſſed, verſ. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There was no more ſpirit in her.]</hi> That is, ſhe was in a manner aſtoniſhed with admiration.</p>

                     <pb n="490" facs="tcp:42229:256"/>Verſ. 11. <hi>And the navie alſo of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees,</hi> &amp;c.] Solomon ſent ſhips of his own, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſhips of Hiram, chap. 9.26. but becauſe his ſhips were built after the Tyrian manner, and with Hirams timber, and eſpecially becauſe the chief mariners in the whole navie, yea even in Solomons ſhips, were the ſervants of Hiram, chap. 9.27. therefore is the navie here called, <hi>the navie of Hiram.</hi> As for the almug-trees, which were herein brought from Ophir, in 2. Chron. 9.10. they are called algume trees; now algume trees Solomon alſo had from Lebanon, 2. Chron. 2.8. <hi>Send me alſo cedar trees, firre trees, and algume trees,</hi> &amp;c. but thoſe it ſeems were farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to theſe that were brought from Ophir, as is expreſſed in the following verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the houſe of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, the pillars in the rails on each ſide of the ſtairs, whereby they did aſcend up to the houſe of the Lord, and therefore, 2. Chron. 9.11. it is ſaid, that he <hi>made terriſes to the houſe of the Lord, and to the kings houſe, of the algume trees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one yeare, was ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix talents of gold.]</hi> To wit, by his ſhips that were ſent out to fetch in gold and other precious commodities (for it is not likely that the kings tribute, or other yearely revenues, of which ſome underſtand this place, was ſtill paid in gold:) indeed the gold that was brought from Ophir, was at the moſt but foure hundred and fifty talents, 2. Chron. 8.18. as was noted above, chap. 9.28. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that there was gold brought from Tharſhiſh, as we find here, verſ. 22. which, with that brought from Ophir, might well make ſix hundred ſixty ſix talents, as is here expreſſed: ſome ſay too, that though at the firſt the return of gold from Ophir, was but foure hundred and fifty talents, yet afterward it came to be more.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold,</hi> &amp;c.] As being made, not for ſervice in the warre, but onely for pomp and ſtate, to ſet forth the majeſty of his royall dignitie; for theſe it is likely were by his guard carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him, as afterwards the brazen ſhields, made in the room of theſe, were carried before Rehoboam, chap. 14.27, 28. &amp; indeed conſidering how ſoon theſe gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en targets and ſhields became a prey to the enemy, it is likely there was an exceſſe of pomp herein, that was not pleaſing to God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And he made three hundred ſhields of beaten gold, three pound of gold went to one ſhield.]</hi> Or three hundred ſhekels, for ſo the weight of theſe ſhields is expreſſed, 2. Chron. 9.16. <hi>And three hundred ſhields made he of beaten gold; three hundred ſhekels of gold went to one ſhield, and the king put them into the houſe of the forreſt of Lebanon:</hi> whereby it appears, that the ſhields were not above half ſo big as the targets, which weighed, each of them, verſ. 16. ſix hundred ſhekels.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivorie, and overlaid it with the beſt gold.]</hi> That is, in ſeverall places; for had it been wholly covered over with gold, to what end had the ivorie been? Now this throne ſtood, doubtleſſe, in the porch of judgement, chap. 7.7.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>The throne had ſix steps,</hi> &amp;c.] And above the uppermoſt of theſe ſix ſteps a footſtool of gold, as is expreſſed, 2. Chron. 9.18. though that be not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here: and thus whileſt the king ſat aloft in his throne, above all the people,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:42229:256"/>

                     <hi>And there were ſtayes on either ſide on the place of the ſeat, and two Lions ſtood by the ſtayes,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe portraitures of lions were not onely by way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, on each ſide the throne by the ſtaies whereon the king laid his armes, and ſo alſo on each ſide the ſix ſteps, by which he went up to the throne, as it follows in the next verſe; but alſo to ſignifie, firſt, the power, the majeſtie, the undaunted boldneſſe, courage and magnanimitie, that ought to be in princes, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how dangerous it is to provoke them to diſpleaſure; whence it is, that princes are frequently in the Scripture, compared to the lion, the king of beaſts, as Prov. 19.12. <hi>The kings wrath is as the roaring of a lion:</hi> ſecondly, the vigilancy and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe that ſhould be in princes, becauſe of their great charge and many enemies, thy had need to wake when others ſleep; as it is ſaid of lions, that they ſleep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with their eyes open: thirdly, that thoſe that are appointed for the guard of kings, had need be both valourous and vigilant, becauſe their charge is ſo precious, and in ſuch continuall danger by reaſon of open and ſecret enemies: fourthly, that princes are ſo guarded by the ſpeciall providence of God over them, that it is as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous to offer them any injurie, as to ruſh upon the mouths of many ramping lions: and fiftly, how dangerous it is to incurre the diſpleaſure of Chriſt; that <hi>lion of the tribe of Judah,</hi> Rev. 5.5. of whom Solomon was a type, and eſpecially to ſeek the overthrow of his kingdome; and that becauſe his power is infinite, and his wrath inſupportable; they that will be ſo deſperate as to put too their hands for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of his throne, ſhall find, that his throne is guarded with lions; they ſhall be torn in pieces, and there ſhall be none to help them.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>BUt king Solomon loved many ſtrange women,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus Solomon ſinned, not onely in that his wives and concubines were <hi>ſtrange women;</hi> that is, not Iſraelites, but of other idolatrous nations; but alſo in that he had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which was againſt the law, concerning the kings of Iſrael, Deut. 17.17. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall he multiply wives to himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And he had ſeven hundred wives, Princeſſes, and three hundred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines.]</hi> A farre leſſe number is reckoned, Cant. 6.8. <hi>There are threeſcore Queens, and fourſcore concubines, and virgins without number.</hi> If therefore there be an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion there to Solomons wives, and concubines; it ſeems he had no more at the time when he wrote that ſong, though afterwards they were increaſed to the number here mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>For it came to paſſe when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods.]</hi> That is, they wonne him to give way to their idolatry: for ſo the moſt, and beſt Expoſitours underſtand this, not that Solomon did indeed eſteem their idols, gods; or that he did himſelf worſhip their idol-gods (for then it is like he would have brought them into the Temple) but that he gave way to the open and publick exerciſe of their idolatrous worſhip; yea furthered it by building temples for them, &amp;c. and thus by ſuffering the wiſeſt of men thus to fall, God was pleaſed to let us ſee, how little truſt there is in the wiſedome of man. The time when he thus fell off from his former integritie, is noted, to wit, that it was <hi>when Solomon was old,</hi> and that either by way of aggravating his ſin, both becauſe his luſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſlaviſh doting upon ſo many idolatrous wives and concubines, was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly in old age, and alſo becauſe after ſo long communion with God, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods goodneſſe, it was the more inſufferable, that he ſhould now fall into
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:42229:257"/>
ſo groſſe a ſinne; or elſe by way of intimating the occaſion of Solomons defection at laſt; namely, that his wives and concubines took the advantage of his weakneſſe in his old age, and ſo wonne him to that which formerly he would not have done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>For Solomon went after Aſhtoreth,</hi> &amp;c.] See concerning Aſhtoreth, Judges 2.13. and of Milcom or Molech, verſ. 7. See Levit. 18.21.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemoſh,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, a place of worſhip for this idol-god, either a Temple, or at leaſt an image and altars to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on; theſe were uſually reared on mountains and hills (though not alwayes, Jer. 7.31. <hi>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the ſonne of Hinnom</hi>) and therefore were called high places; and ſo accordingly did So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon build theſe high places, for his wives idol-gods, <hi>in the hill that is before Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> that is, in mount Olivet, of which mention is made, 2. Sam. 15.30. called afterwards <hi>the mount of corruption;</hi> where they continued till Joſiahs dayes, 2. Kings 23.13. <hi>And the high places that were before Jeruſalem, on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Iſrael had builded, did the king de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file:</hi> probable it is, that Solomon did purpoſely build them out of the citie, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too much to defile the citie which God had choſen for his dwelling place, with ſuch abominations: but yet being ſet up ſo nigh the Temple, they might ſeem ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to outbrave or defie Gods Temple; and therefore even hereby his ſinne was ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And likewiſe did he for all his strange wives.]</hi> Though at firſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely he might onely grant this favour to one or two of his wives, yet the reſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees pleaded for the ſame libertie, and ſo at laſt he was brought to build high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for all his wives idol-gods.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>His heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, which had appeared unto him twice.]</hi> That is, in an extraordinary way, as he uſed to appear to his Prophets, by dreams and nightly viſions, to wit, once at Gibeon, chap. 3.5. and the ſecond time at Jeruſalem, chap. 9.2. which being a ſingular favour, is therefore mentioned as a great aggravation of his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>I will ſurely rend the kingdome from thee, and will give it to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.]</hi> And thus God repayed him in his kind; for as he divided the honour that was onely due to God, leaving part of it to the Lord, and giving away part of it to his wives idol-gods; ſo the Lord dealt with his poſterity in regard of the kingdome, leaving his ſonne two tribes, and giving away ten of the twelve tribes to Jeroboam his ſervant.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Notwithſtanding, in thy dayes I will not do it, for David thy fathers ſake.]</hi> That is, becauſe of the promiſe made to him, 2. Sam. 7.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>But will give one tribe to thy ſonne,</hi> &amp;c.) To wit, one of the tribes of Iſrael, conſidered apart from the tribe of Judah: of the twelve tribes there were but ten that followed Jeroboam, verſ. 31. Rehoboam therefore and his poſterity had two tribes that revolted not to Jeroboam, to wit, Judah and Benjamin, 2. Chron. 11.12. <hi>having Judah and Benjamin on his ſide:</hi> and why then is it ſaid here, that one tribe onely ſhould be given to Solomons ſonne? I anſwer, becauſe he ſpeaks here of the tribes that belonged to the kingdome of Iſrael. Judah in regard of her eminencie, was ſtill reckoned apart from the reſt of the tribes, 1. Sam. 11.8. <hi>And when he
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:42229:258"/>
numbred them in Bezek, the children of Iſrael were three hundred thouſand, and the men of Judah thirty thouſand:</hi> but eſpecially after that diviſion when Judah fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed David, and the other tribes followed the houſe of Saul, henceforth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Judah and the kingdome of Iſrael were ſtill diſtinguiſhed; yea, even after both were jointly under Davids command, 2. Sam. 5.5. <hi>In Hebron he reigned over Judah ſeven years and ſix moneths, and in Jeruſalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Iſrael and Judah.</hi> Now the Lord therefore threatning the rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the kingdome of Iſrael, from the houſe of David, he addes, <hi>Howbeit, I will not rend away all the kingdome</hi> (that is, all the kingdome of Iſrael) <hi>but will give one tribe to thy ſonne;</hi> that is, one of the tribes that belonged to the kingdome of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, namely Benjamin: ſee the notes verſ. 3. and chap. 12.20. and this the Lord promiſeth to do for David his ſervants ſake, and for Jeruſalems ſake, which he had choſen, to wit, that in the citie which God had choſen, they might live under the government of Davids ſeed, the true heirs of the kingdome, from whom the Meſſiah was to deſcend.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>When David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the hoſt was gone up to bury the ſlain,</hi> &amp;c.] Of Davids ſubduing the Edomites, we reade 2. Sam. 8.14. <hi>And he put gariſons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he gariſons, and they of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom became Davids ſervants,</hi> and at this time, it ſeems, whileſt Joab proſecuted his victory, ſlaying all the males where he came, Hadad was hid being a little child, and afterwards, whileſt he went about to ſee that all the dead that he had ſlain were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, Hadad ſecretly eſcaped away. Yet ſome conceive otherwiſe of this paſſage, to wit, that after the conqueſt of the Edomites, 2. Sam. 8.14. the Edomites fell upon the gariſons which David left behind him, and ſlew them: whereupon Joab went up to bury the dead, and to be avenged on the Edomites, and ſo ſlaying all the males where he came, Hadad of the ſeed-royall was conveyed away.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Hadad ſaid to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go into mine own countrey.]</hi> As conceiving hope of recovering the kingdome of Edom, now David and Joab were dead, whom, it ſeems, he much feared; or at leaſt of enjoying liberty upon ſome honourable conditions, to live again in his native countrey: yet it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt he attempted nothing againſt Solomon a long time after this; for he left Egypt immediately after Davids death, before Pharaoh had cauſe to be jealous of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his affinitie with Solomon, and till Solomons fall in his old age, his enemies ſtirred not, chap. 5.4. <hi>But now the Lord my God hath given me reſt on every ſide;</hi> ſo that it ſeems, he either lay hid along time in Idumea, or made ſome covenant with Solomon, as becoming tributarie to him for his kingdome; yea, when he did ſtirre, he was not able to ſhake off the yoke, for the Edomites continued tributaries to the kings of Judah till Jehorams reigne, 2. Chron. 21.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Rezon the ſonne of Eliadah, which fled from his Lord Hadadezar, king of Zobah.]</hi> To wit, when David had gotten the better of his maſter in battel; this it ſeems was when David got that great victory of the Syrians, mentioned, 2. Sam. 10.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And they went to Damaſcus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.]</hi>
                     <pb n="495" facs="tcp:42229:258"/>
David had put a gariſon in Damaſcus, 2. Sam. 8.6. It ſeems therefore, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon with his band of men, ſet upon this gariſon, and took the place from Solomon, and ſo there reigned as king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And he was an adverſary to Iſrael all the dayes of Solomon.]</hi> That is, after his firſt riſing againſt him: it is likely he was an adverſary in heart, ever ſince he fled in that battel wherein his lord Hadadezer was vanquiſhed, and that then he gathered this band of men here mentioned, perhaps of his lords broken troops: yet becauſe <hi>David put gariſons in Syria of Damaſcus,</hi> 2. Sam. 8.1, 6. and it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that Solomon loſt any thing of that which his father had gotten, till himſelf fell from God, chap. 5.4. therefore it is thought, that this Rezon did elſewhere ſhelter himſelf, or lived by ſecret robbing and pillaging, till Solomons declining dayes; and that then he brought Damaſcus to an open revolt, and became king there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and was an enemy to Solomon on the north, as Hadad the Edomite was on the ſouth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And Jeroboam the ſonne of Nebat, an Ephrathite,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>An Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite:</hi> that is, of the tribe of Ephraim, and ſo in this tribe all the kings of Iſrael, that raigned over the ten tribes had their chief reſidence, and herein was that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie fulfilled, that Ephraim ſhould be greater then Manaſſeh, Gen. 48.19. now of this man it is ſaid, that <hi>he lift up his hand againſt the king,</hi> to wit, by revolting from him, and becoming the head of the ten tribes, in rending the kingdome from his ſonne; for though perhaps after he had heard the propheſie of Ahijah, he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thoughts of diſloyaltie againſt his Soveraigne; and perhaps ſecretly ſow ſome ſeeds of ſedition among the people, for which he was glad to fly into Egypt, verſ. 40. yet we read of nothing he openly attempted againſt Solomon, or againſt his houſe, till Solomon was dead.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>He made him ruler over all the charge of the houſe of Joſeph.]</hi> That is, he made him receiver or treaſurer for all the kings revenues in the two tribes of Ephraim and Manaſſeh.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>When Jeroboam went out of Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to enter upon the office and charge which Solomon had honoured him with, <hi>the prophet Ahijah found him in the way,</hi> who is called the Shilonite, becauſe he was of Shilo, where the Tabernacle was many years together: (he was one of them that wrote the Acts of Solomon, 2 Chron. 9.29.) <hi>and they two were alone in the field.</hi> If therefore Jeroboam went attended out of Jeruſalem, according to the honour of the charge whereto Solomon had now advanced him, it ſeems the Prophet deſired to have ſome private conference with him, and then when they were alone delivered his meſſage to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him.]</hi> That is, the new garment wherewith the Prophet (who now repreſented Gods perſon the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute diſpoſer of the kingdome, newly erected in the houſe of David) had clad himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Behold I will rend the kingdome out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.]</hi> That is, all beſides Judah and Benjamin: ſome conceive that Simeon was the onely tribe, which joyned with that of Judah, as having their lot within the lot of Judah, Joſh. 19.2. but this cannot be; becauſe thoſe of the tribe
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:42229:259"/>
of Simeon that joyned themſelves with Aſa, are expreſſely ſaid to be ſuch as revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the kingdome of Iſrael, 2 Chron. 15.9. Neither need it ſeem ſtrange, that the tribe of Simeon, having their portion within that of Judah, ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding belong to the kingdome of Iſrael; for it ſeems that the Simeonites in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids time, went forth with Colonies, and planted themſelves in other places, as is manifeſt 1 Chron. 4.31, 39. However by foretelling Jeroboam what ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the Lord took order that he ſhould know, that whatever ſhould occaſion that revolt of the ten tribes from the houſe of David, yet it was by the providence of God, who had now conferred the kingdome upon him. See the note alſo, verſ. 13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>Becauſe that they have forſaken me, and have worſhiped Aſhtoreth,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the reaſon given for that he had ſaid before, verſ. 31. <hi>I will rend the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of the hand of Solomon, &amp;c.]</hi> But why ſhould Rehoboam ſuffer in the loſſe of ten tribes for the peoples idolatry? I anſwer: firſt, becauſe Solomons giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to his wives idolatry, proved a ſnare to the people, and occaſioned their revolting from God: and ſecondly, even the people ſuffered, as well as Rehoboam hereby: this rent in the kingdome proving the occaſion of continuall warre between them of Judah and them of Iſrael, which brought in many miſeries from forraigne nations upon both kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>And unto his ſonne will I give one tribe, that David my ſervant may have a light alway before me,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, unto one of his poſteritie, ſitting in the throne of David. See the note, 2 Sam. 21.17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And I will for this afflict the ſeed of David, but not for ever.]</hi> For at length Chriſt aroſe out of the tribe of Judah, to whom God gave <hi>the throne of his father David,</hi> to <hi>reign over the whole houſe of David for ever,</hi> Luk. 1.32, 33.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>Solomon ſought therefore to kill Jeroboam, and Jeroboam aroſe, and fled into Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby it appears, that Jeroboam had ſome way diſcovered that which the Prophet had ſo ſecretly imparted to him, and perhaps began to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the hearts of the people from the king: and ſo to eſcape Solomons fury, he fled to Shiſhak king of Egypt, and ſheltered himſelf there till Solomon was dead: and yet was this Shiſhak Solomons brother in law, if he were (as generally it is thought he was) the ſonne of that Pharoah king of Egypt, whoſe daughter Solomon had married.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. <hi>All that he did, and his wiſedome, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?]</hi> The acts of Solomon were written by Nathan, Ahijah, and Iddo, prophets that lived in Solomons time, 2 Chron. 9.29. but this book here mentioned, ſeems to have been ſome complete hiſtorie (not now extant) of the reigne of Solomon gathered out of the ſeverall writings of theſe prophets, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of thoſe times, wherein many particulars of his life were recorded, not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſacred ſtorie; and amongſt other things doubtleſſe that of his repentance, for though it be not here expreſſed, yet that he did repent before his death, may be evidently gathered from other places of Scripture as 2 Chron. 11.17. <hi>So they ſtrengthened the kingdome of Judah, and made Rehoboam the ſonne of Solomon ſtrong three yeares, for three yeares they walked in the way of David, and of his ſonne Solomon:</hi> where Solomon and David are joyntly commended: and from

Chron. 12.13. Being therefore the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted heir to the kingdome (for God had now ſettled the kingdome upon Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and his heirs, 2.

Surely this doth very probably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the ten tribes being already ſeditiouſly enclined, did preſently upon the death of Solomon revive the memory of that old diviſion of the kingdome, in the dayes of David and Iſhboſheth the ſonne of Saul, 2. Sam. 2.8, 9, 10. and did open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make known that they would have him receive the crown and kingdome of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el apart by it ſelf, as David did at Hebron, 2. Sam. 5.3. and to that end called an aſſembly of the people at Shechem; reſolving to make themſelves another king if Rehoboam gave them not the better ſatisfaction, and that this was the cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboams going thither.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>When Jeroboam the ſonne of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when he heard of Solomons death, and that the ten tribes began to ſtirre againſt Rehoboam, and to that end had appointed an aſſembly at Shechem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>They ſent, and called him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, at the ſame time when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gave him notice of Solomons death, &amp;c. they deſired him to come out of Egypt to them; and this too diſcovered that they meant not well to Rehoboam, whatever they pretended, that they ſend for Jeroboam, who fled away, as a traytour, from Solomon his father into the land of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Thy father made our yoke grievous,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by tributes and taxes impoſed upon them; for though he made not the Iſraelites bondmen, chap. 9.22. yet we reade of proviſion that was gathered in all his land for his houſhold, chap. 4.7. and of levies made for his buildings, chap. 9.15. and beſides, in his latter dayes, when his thouſand wives and concubines were to be provided for, and Temples built for their idol-gods, and withall, Hadad of Edom, and Rezon of Damaſcus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make warre againſt him, we may well think he laid ſtill greater and heavier impoſitions upon them; and of theſe they deſired now to be eaſed, in this petition they preſented to Rehoboam; they had cauſe enough indeed to complain of Solomons
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:42229:260"/>
government in his latter dayes, becauſe of the idolatry he had ſet up in the land; but of this they ſpeak not one word, but onely complain of their taxes, <hi>Make thou the greivous ſervice, and the heavie yoke, whith thy father put upon us, lighter, and we will ſerve thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And king Rehoboam conſulted with the old men that ſtood before Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon his father,</hi> &amp;c.] How much more likely theſe men were to give him the beſt counſel, then thoſe whoſe counſel he afterwards followed, is intimated in theſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, becauſe they were old men, whoſe judgement is uſually, by long experience, better then the judgement of younger men, <hi>with the ancient is wiſedome, and in length of dayes is underſtanding,</hi> Job. 12.12. And ſecondly, becauſe they had <hi>stood before Solomon his father;</hi> that is, they had been of his ſervants and counſel, and could not therefore but learn much wiſedome of him, who was the great oracle of wiſedome in thoſe dayes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>If thou wilt be a ſervant unto this people this day, and wilt ſerve them,</hi> &amp;c.] In 2. Chron. 10.7. it is, <hi>If thou be kind to this people, and pleaſe them, and ſpeak good words to them,</hi> that is, if thou wilt anſwer them gently (which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the counſel of his father Solomon, Prov. 15.1. <hi>a ſoft anſwer turneth away wrath</hi>) and if thou wilt grant them their deſire at preſent, then they will alwayes continue thy ſubjects and ſervants. Becauſe Rehoboam might think, that if he ſhould yield to the people, when they came in ſuch an imperious inſolent manner, hereby he ſhould make himſelf a ſlave, and a ſervant to thoſe, which ſhould be ſubjects and ſervants to him; therefore to anſwer this, the old men expreſſe themſelves thus, <hi>If thou wilt be a ſervant to this people this day,</hi> &amp;c. as if they ſhould ſay, Be it ſo: bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is to be a ſervant to them for a day, and to ſtoop to them beyond that which were otherwiſe fitting, and ſo to work them to the obedience of ſubjects by degrees, which afterwards may be eaſily done, then by ſtanding too much upon terms of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour now to enrage them, and drive them off, to an open rebellion: and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was wiſe politick counſel: but yet obſervable it is, that as Princes counſellours are wont to do, that which they aimed at was not the benefit, and eaſe of the people, but that he might appeaſe them for the preſent; and ſo having wonne them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his ſoveraignty, might afterwards uſe them as he pleaſed himſelf, <hi>then they will be</hi> (ſay they) <hi>thy ſervants for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>But he forſook the counſel of the old men,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he miſliked their counſel, to wit, becauſe he thought it ſtood not with his honour ſo to ſtoop to the people, and ſo thereupon <hi>he conſulted with the young men that were growen up with him, and ſtood before him,</hi> that is, the young gallants that attended him in his court, the ſonnes of the Nobles, that had been from their childhood and youth brought up with him; and herein we have the reaſon intimated, why he afterwards preferred theſe mens counſels before the counſel of his aged grave Senatours, to wit, becauſe his affection was more to theſe then to the other, and ſo that made him the more inclinable to like that which they ſaid: but herein Rehoboam did notably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his folly, and made good what his father had written, Eccleſ. 2.18, 19. <hi>I hated all my labour which I had taken under the ſun, becauſe I ſhould leave it unto the man that ſhall be after me: And who knows whether he ſhall be a wiſe man or a fool? yet ſhall he have dominion over all my labours.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="499" facs="tcp:42229:260"/>Verſ. 10. <hi>My little finger ſhall be thicker then my fathers loins,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe were doubtleſſe, proverbiall ſpeeches, the meaning whereof was, that Rehoboam would lay farre heavier burdens upon the people, then ever his father had; and that he would handle them more ſeverely then ever his father had done: <hi>my father hath chaſtiſed you with whips, but I will chaſtiſe you with ſcorpions;</hi> that is, with whips that ſting like ſcorpions: and ſome indeed think, that there was a kind of whips uſed in thoſe times, that for this cauſe were called ſcorpions: now herein was the folly of Rehoboams young courtiers diſcovered, that would teach their king to give ſuch harſh language to a people that were already in a mutinous temper: it was ill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming they might think into his clutches, whoſe little finger was ſo heavie; nor could there be any hope of fair uſage from him, that when he came to treat with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, could ſpeak of nothing but yokes, and whips, and ſcorpions.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>The people anſwered the king, ſaying, What portion have we in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid?</hi> &amp;c.] What have we to do with the poſterity of David? we will have a king again of our own tribes, as formerly: a ſeditious ſpeech, much like that of Sheba, 2. Sam. 20.1. <hi>We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the ſonne of Jeſſe:</hi> and whereto happely they did allude: beſides, by calling David, as it were in ſcorn, <hi>the ſonne of Jeſſe,</hi> they imply, that he having been formerly raiſed by them from a mean condition, to be their king, it was not ſufferable that his grandchild ſhould now tyrannize over them, as if they were ſcarce good enough to be his ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To your tents, O Iſrael.]</hi> That is, Let us return to our own dwellings, and not ſtay here to make our ſelves ſlaves to ſuch a tyrant, but amongſt our own tribes let us make us a king. Becauſe of old they dwelt in tents, this phraſe had ever ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in uſe amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now ſee to thine houſe, David.]</hi> This alſo was ſpoken by way of deriſion and ſcorn, as if they ſhould have ſaid, Let Rehoboam the ſonne of David make much of his own tribe (for beyond their bounds his kingdome is not like to extend) we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take care of our ſelves, and to provide a king amongſt our own tribes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>But as for the children of Iſrael which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.]</hi> Two ſeverall wayes this may be underſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Iſraelites of the ten tribes, that ſuch of them as left their land in the dayes of Jeroboam, &amp; came and dwelt <hi>in the cities of Judah,</hi> did ſubmit themſelves to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam, as their brethren of Judah did; or elſe, rather of the men of Judah, who are here called <hi>the children of Iſrael, which dwelt in the cities of Judah;</hi> that though their brethren of Iſrael fell off from Rehoboam, yet the continued conſtant to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Then king Rehoboam ſent Adoram, who was over the tribute,</hi> &amp;c.] It is moſt probable, that this man was ſent (yet too late) to pacifie the people: but being one of the taxers of the people, the very ſight of him did more enrage them, and thereupon they ſtoned him, and this too was a notable act of folly in Rehoboam.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>So Iſrael rebelled againſt the houſe of David unto this day.]</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ten tribes is here called <hi>rebellion,</hi> which ſhews plainly, that it was a ſinne in them thus to caſt off their lawfull ſovereigne: for though the Prophet Ahijah had foretold and promiſed, that Jeroboam ſhould be king of the ten tribes, chap. 11.31. yet becauſe the people had no command from God herein, but did what they did
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:42229:261"/>
merely of their own heads, and in a diſcontent againſt Rehoboam, their wayes were rebellious, however they did thereby accompliſh what God had determined.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And it came to paſſe, that when all Iſrael heard that Jeroboam was come again,</hi> &amp;c.] It is manifeſt, that Jeroboam was amongſt the reſst, when at firſt they demanded of Rehoboam a relaxation of their burdens, verſ. 3. <hi>And Jeroboam, and all the congregation of Iſrael came, and ſpake unto Rehoboam:</hi> but it ſeems that was then known onely to ſome of the chief of the congregation, which when it came to be generally known amongſt the people, they preſently aſſembled themſelves, ſent for him, and made him their king; as here it is ſaid. Thus generally Expoſitours under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this place; yet it may be that being here to relate how the Iſraelites made Jeroboam their king, their firſt calling him to their aſſembly is onely here again repeated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There was none that followed the houſe of David, but the tribe of Judah onely.]</hi> It is manifeſt, that there were but ten tribes that revolted to Jeroboam, chap. 11.31. and therefore Rehoboam muſt needs have two tribes, which were Judah and Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; as is clearly expreſſed, 2 Chro. 11.2. but becauſe Benjamin was but a poore lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tribe, and being joyned with Judah, were ſtill comprehended under the name of the kingdome of Judah; therefore it is ſaid here, that none continued firm to Rehoboam, <hi>but the tribe of Judah onely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, You ſhall not go up, nor ſight againſt your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe God had decreed that the ten tribes ſhould rend themſelves, as they had done, from the houſe of David; for ſo it follows in the next words, <hi>return every man to his houſe, for this thing is from me.</hi> There is indeed an intimation too, of another motive in theſe firſt words, to wit, that the Iſiraelites were their brethren: but this is not mentioned as a ſufficient cauſe apart by it ſelf, but as a circumſtance which might render them the more willing to ſubmit to what God had determined: we ſee in the warre which they made againſt Benjamin, with Gods approbation, Judg. 20.1. that it was not unlawfull for Gods people, in any caſe, to fight againſt their brethren: but that which made it now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, was, becauſe God did now make known to them, that this which was done was of him; and then to make them the more willing to ſubmit to Gods decree herein, even this alſo might be laid into the ballance, that the warre, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was againſt their brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They hearkened therefore to the word of the Lord, and returned,</hi> &amp;c.] and ſo all was ſtayed for the preſent. Nor do we ever reade that Rehoboam, as bad as he was, did ever after this, attempt to recover the kingdome of Iſrael out of the hands of Jeroboam; but yet there was continuall hoſtilitie betwixt theſe two kings; and the borderers on both ſides did continually make inrodes one upon another, chap. 14.30.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Then Jeroboam built Shechem,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he forrified theſe two cities, Shechem and Pennel, the one within Jordan, and the other without; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we reade that Shechem was utterly ruined by Abimelech, in the dayes of the Judges Jud. 9.45.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>If this people go up to do ſacrifice in the houſe of the Lord at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] Though God had promiſed Jeroboam by Ahijah the prophet, chap. 11.38.
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:42229:261"/>
that if he would walk in his wayes, he would be with him, and build him a ſure houſe, as he had done for David; yet having no confidence in this promiſe of God, he concluded, that if the people ſhould continue to go up to Jeruſalem to ſacrifice, they would ſoon return to Rehoboam again; to wit, firſt, becauſe they would be forced for fear of being apprehended as traitours when they came to Jeruſalem, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give over their offering of ſacrifices to God, or elſe to make their peace with Rehoboam: ſecondly, becauſe the prieſts and Levites (and their brethren of Judah too) would be preſſing them with the ſinne of their rebellion, againſt their lawfull ſoveraigne, and ſhewing them how unlike the Lord was to regard the ſacrifices of thoſe that lived in ſo groſſe a ſinne: and thirdly, becauſe the very ſight of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ſerious thoughts they muſt needs have of God, and of themſelves, when they came to offer up their ſacrifices there, muſt needs ſtrike them with an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of their guilt, in rejecting him, whom God had appointed to rule over them: and ſo hereupon he reſolved to ſet up ſome other way of worſhip for them: and thus that very thing which God had appointed purpoſely, to keep them in one uniform way of worſhip; namely, that there ſhould be but one altar, and one place of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, to wit, at the Temple in Jeruſalem, to which they ſhould reſort from all parts of the land; even that I ſay, proved the occaſion of ſetting up a new way of worſhip, to wit, that of worſhiping the golden calves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>Whereupon the king took counſel, and made two calves of gold,</hi> &amp;c.] In imitation (as of old) of the Egyptians idol-god, amongſt whom Jeroboam had lived of late, and with whom, it ſeems, he held a ſtrict league and amitie: God had raiſed him from nothing to be king of Iſrael, and he turned this his God into the image of a calf that eateth hay. See the note, Exod. 32.4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And he ſet the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.]</hi> Beth-el was in the tribe of Benjamin, but fell away it ſeems to Jeroboam and the ten tribes, and ſo was in the very skirts of his kingdome ſouthwards, cloſe by the portion of the tribe of Benjamin; and Dan was in the utmoſt part of the kingdome north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>The people went to worſhip before the one, even-unto Dan.]</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this may be, that they went firſt to that in Dan; or elſe, that the people did preſently yield to worſhip theſe his idol-gods, and went at the uſuall times to his golden calves, yea even to that which was furtheſt off, even to Dan: nay perhaps, that even thoſe that dwelt about Beth-el would go to the idol at Dan, and thoſe that dwelt about Dan would go to Beth-el; and what was then eaſed of their travelling to Jeruſalem?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And made prieſts of the lowest of the people, which were not of the ſonnes of Levi.]</hi> For the prieſts and Levites that dwelt in Iſrael, left their ſuburbs and their poſſeſſions and went to Judah and Jeruſalem, 2 Chron. 11.14. and that becauſe <hi>Ieroboam and his ſonnes had caſt them off from executing the prieſts office unto the Lord:</hi> and hereby no doubt, Jeroboam greatly enriched himſelf, as taking into his hands all thoſe cities which had been given them by Moſes and Joſhua: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the baſeſt of the people were prieſts good enough for his golden calves; but becauſe he pretended the worſhip of the true God in them, even this is charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as a ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:42229:262"/>Verſ. 32. <hi>And Jeroboam ordained a feaſt in the eighth moneth, on the fifteenth day of the moneth, like unto the feast that is in Judah.]</hi> That is, like unto the feaſt of Tabernacles: the meaning is this, whereas God appointed the Iſraelites to keep the feaſt of Tabernacles, on the fifteenth day of the ſeventh moneth, Levit. 23.34. he appointed his people to keep a feaſt like unto this, by way of thankfulneſſe for the fruits of the earth then gathered in; but it muſt be on the eighth moneth, not the ſeventh, leaſt the people taking it to be the the ſame feaſt of Tabernacles, ſhould at laſt begin to ſcruple that their males were bound all to go to Jeruſalem to keep this feaſt according to the law, Deut. 16.16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he offered upon the altar,</hi> &amp;c.] To grace the way of worſhip which he had ſet up, even he himſelf did undertake to do the work of a prieſt upon the altar that he had built: whence it is, that in the following chapter, verſ. 4. it is ſaid, that <hi>he put forth his hand from the altar,</hi> for the apprehending the man of God, that foretold the ruine of it.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd behold, there came a man of God out of Judah, by the word of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, by the command of the Lord. And thus the Lord did betimes give Jeroboam warning, and called him to repentance, as he did alſo often afterward by Ahijah, Chap. 14.7, 8. and by Iddo the prophet, 2 Chron. 9.29. <hi>In the book of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the viſions of Iddo the Seer, againſt Jeroboam the ſonne of Nebat.</hi> Indeed the moſt Expoſitours from Joſephus hold, that Iddo was this man of God here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; but that cannot be, for this man of God was immediately after ſlain by a lion, in the very beginning of Jeroboams reigne, whereas Iddo lived to write the <hi>acts of Rehoboam, firſt and laſt,</hi> 2 Chron. 12, 15. and 13.22.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And he cryed againſt the altar in the word of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in Gods name, or with the word or meſſage which God had given him in charge, to wit, that which follows in the next words, <hi>O altar, altar, thus ſaith the Lord, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a child ſhall be born unto the houſe of David, Joſiah by name,</hi> &amp;c. wherein he directed his ſpeech to the altar, thereby covertly to imply, that it was in vain to ſpeak to Jeroboam, and repeated the word altar twice, <hi>O altar, altar,</hi> to ſignifie the obſervableneſſe of what he had to ſay, and the zeal and fervencie of his ſpirit, in the obſervableneſſe of what rivall altar, ſet up, as it were, in defiance againſt the altar of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And upon thee ſhall he offer the prieſts of the high places, and burn incenſe upon thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the dead bones of the prieſts, that do now, and ſhall hereafter burn incenſe upon thee: for ſo the accompliſhment of this prophecy is related in the ſtory of Joſiah, about three hundred years after it was foretold by this man of God, 2 King. 23.16. and indeed therefore is the next clauſe added here, by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining this, <hi>and mens bones ſhall be burnt upon thee:</hi> but howſoever this he calls an offering of the prieſts upon the altar: firſt, as in ſcorn of their idolatrous altar, which ſhould one day have ſuch a goodly ſacrifice burnt upon it, even a ſacrifice of dead mens bones: ſecondly, by way of deriding their prieſts, that ſhould one day be themſelves burnt as a ſacrifice upon their altar, as they had turned their Creator
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:42229:262"/>
into a beaſt, a calf; ſo their bones, as the bones of ſo many beaſts and calves, ſhould be burnt as an offering upon their altar: and thirdly, to intimate, that the defiling and polluting of this their idolatrous altar, ſhould be indeed as a ſacrifice moſt acceptable unto God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Behold, the altar ſhall be rent,</hi> &amp;c.] And thereby was ſignified the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture demoliſhing of that altar; and rooting out that ſuperſtitious worſhip which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam had now eſtabliſhed, at the command of Joſiah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>He put forth his hand from the altar, ſaying, Lay hold on him,</hi> &amp;c.] His ſtretching forth his hand, was as a ſigne of that which he ſpake; namely, that he would have had the people lay hold upon the Prophet: and ſo likewiſe the Lords cauſing his hand to be ſo ſuddenly dried up, was not onely to diſable him from hurting the Prophet, but alſo that all the people might be ſcared from aiding their king in what he required.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>The altar alſo was rent,</hi> &amp;c.] Firſt Jeroboams hand was withered, and then afterwards his altar was rent; and thus the Lord was pleaſed to ſhew how tender he was of the ſafety of his ſervant, in that he would firſt revenge the violence intended to him, ere he revenged the diſhonour that was done to himſelf in that their idolatrous altar.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the ſame way that thou cameſt.]</hi> One reaſon why the Lord would not have the Prophet eat nor drink in that place, might be, that the Prophet might not, by receiving any kindneſſe or curteſie there, ſeem to mind himſelf, or his own benefit: and ſo alſo the reaſon why he was forbidden to return the way he came, might be, (as ſome conceive) that he might not ſeem to come back, as afraid, or aſhamed to do what he was enjoyned, according to that, 2. Kings 19.33. <hi>By the way that he came, by the ſame ſhall he return.</hi> But indeed the chief ground of this whole charge, I rather conceive was to ſignifie how the Lord deteſted both the place and the people, becauſe of their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that he would not ſuffer his Prophet to eat or drink amongſt them, nor return the way he came, but go thence ſome other way; as abhorring the very way that had brought him to the ſight of ſuch abominations.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Now there dwelt an old Prophet in Beth-el,</hi> &amp;c.] There he dwelt at preſent, having formerly removed from Samaria thither, whence it is that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Prophet that came out of Samaria,</hi> 2.

It is very queſtionable what this old Prophet was, the rather becauſe it ſeems that his ſonnes were preſent at Jeroboams idolatrous worſhip, for here it is ſaid, that <hi>his ſonnes came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el, and the words which he had ſpoken unto the king, them they told alſo;</hi> to wit, thoſe verſ. 8, 9, 10. that if the king would give him half his houſe he would neither eat nor drink in that place; and that becauſe the Lord had given him an expreſſe charge to the contrary: all which muſt needs imply, that either they joyned with the reſt in that idolatrous worſhip, or were at leaſt faulty, in that they could pleaſe themſelves with ſeeing the ſolemnitie of a ſervice ſo diſhonourable to the Lord; and indeed Gods diſpleaſure againſt them for this was diſcovered, in that their preſence there proved the occaſion of ſuch a grievous ſinne to their father; ſome Expoſitours conceive that this old man was no Prophet of the Lords, but a falſe prophet, and an upholder of the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:42229:263"/>
of Beth-el, and that fearing leſt Jeroboam ſhould henceforth diſregard him, and be ſcared by that which had happened from this their new erected religion, he laid that plot which is here afterwards related to deceive the Prophet, hoping that (as it fell out) upon his diſobeying Gods command, ſome judgement would fall upon him, and that then both Jeroboam and the people would ſleight his predictions, and be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed in their idolatrous courſes: again, others conceive that he was indeed a Prophet of the Lords, but a vicious wicked man, and that becauſe he framed ſo groſſe a lie, verſ. 18. to deceive the man of God that came from Judah: and others that he was both a true Prophet, and a good man; and that onely at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left of God, he was ſhamefully overcome by the devils temptations, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of his own heart: for hearing what had paſſed in the kings chappell at Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th-el, and finding himſelf touched in that particular, that the Lord would not ſuffer the Prophet to eat or drink in Beth-el, wherein he lived conſtantly with his children and familie; he had above all a deſire to try him in this, whether God had indeed given him ſuch a charge or no: and ſo through the ſubtilty of Sathan, was drawn to pretend that God had appeared unto him, and appointed him to fetch him back, verſ. 18. and indeed this to me ſeems moſt probable; firſt, becauſe he is expreſſely called an old Prophet: ſecondly, becauſe the Lord by him, did afterward denounce the puniſhment that ſhould fall upon the deceived Prophet, verſ. 21.22. thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great reſpect he afforded the Prophet, both dead and living; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he aſſured his ſonnes, that what he had propheſied againſt the altar at Beth-el, ſhould ſurely come to paſſe, verſ. 31.32.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And found him ſitting under an oak, and he ſaid unto him, Art thou the man of God?</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophets ſitting under an oak, was doubtleſſe from weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and faintneſſe; the rather, becauſe he had been reſtrained from eating and drinking in Beth-el: nor need it ſeem ſtrange, that the old Prophet having never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen him, ſhould ſo preſently gueſſe him to be the man he looked after: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the deſcription his ſonnes might give of him, even by ſome mantle or other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, peculiar to the Prophets in thoſe times, he might know him to be a man of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his houſe, and drank water,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus by that he, which the old Prophet did tell him, he was wonne to do, what no perſwaſions of the king could winne him to do. Indeed he ſhould not have credited the uncertain report of a Prophet, ſo directly contrary to that which he was ſure God had already given him in charge; but, firſt, the ſpecious name of a Prophet deceived him: ſecondly, the thing which the old Prophet deſired of him, was like to be a charge and trouble to him, but could be no way any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him, and why (might he think) ſhould an old Prophet lie, when he could not hope to any thing by it: and thirdly, it was not altogether improbable, but that God might have countermanded what he had formerly enjoyned him: to encline him to judge ſo, he might remember how the Lord countermanded what he had formerly enjoyned Abraham, concerning the ſacrificing of his ſonne; and might think that now the Lord had proved him, and found him faithfull, he was willing to take off this charge, as pitying his faintneſſe for want of food; and that though God would not ſuffer him to eat of the kings meat, yet he would permit him to refreſh himſelf in a Prophets houſe. Theſe and other conſiderations, mighth move
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:42229:263"/>
him to believe what the old Prophet had ſaid, the rather, becauſe his deſire of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, after ſuch a time of abſtinence and travell, muſt needs make him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to hearken to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>The word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back.]</hi> To wit, by ſome intemall inſpiration, or prophetick extaſie, whereby he was, as it were, conſtrained to denounce againſt his ſeduced gueſt, even whileſt he ſate at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the judgement that ſhould fall upon him for his eating and drinking with him; and ſo conſequently, to condemn himſelf for that groſſe lie wherewith he had deceived him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Thy carcaſe ſhall not come unto the ſepulchre of thy fathers.]</hi> And herein was implyed, that he ſhould die in his return, before he gat home to his own land; a gracious warning, that he might repent of his ſinne before his death.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>He ſadled for him the aſſe.</hi> That is, for the Prophet whom he had brought back he ſadled his own aſſe: for we read not, but that hitherto the man of God that came from Judah had gone on foot; and doubtleſſe the more officious and kind he was, becauſe he conſidered the miſchief he had done him, and was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it; yet withall, obſervable it is, that he did not accompany him home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which might well be for ſcare of being involved with him in the judgement that was to come upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>A lion met him by the way, and ſlew him.]</hi> And thus, firſt, the Lord chaſtiſed his ſervant for his ſinne: ſecondly, he confirmed the certainty of what this man of God had formerly ſpoken in his name: he told the king that God had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him not to eat in that place: ſo that, when ſuch a hand of God was upon him, for not perſevering to obey this command, every one might hereby be aſſured, that he was indeed a prophet of God: and that all the reſt that he had ſpoken concerning Jeroboams altar ſhould in its ſeaſon come to paſſe too, as the old Prophet did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from hence conclude, verſ. 32. and thirdly, he ſhewed how he abhorred that place, in that he ſlew his own Prophet for eating and drinking amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the aſſe ſtood by it, the lion alſo ſtood by the carcaſe.]</hi> That the aſſe ſhould not ſly from the lion, and that the lion ſhould neither prey upon the living aſſe, not the Prophets dead body; but ſhould rather ſtand as a guard to preſerve the dead body from being torn by other creatures, and as it were to force the aſſe not to ſtir thence, but to ſtay there in a readineſſe to carry back his maſters body to be buried in Beth-el, I ſay both theſe are miraculous paſſages; and were as ſignes to manifeſt unto all men, firſt, that it was not hunger that had provoked the beaſt to this violence, but the over-ruling command and providence of God: and ſecondly, that God loved his Prophet dead, and would miraculouſly preſerve him for buriall, though he had teſtified his diſpleaſure againſt his ſinne, (for the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others) even by taking away his life.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And the prophet took up the carcaſe of the man of God,</hi> &amp;c.] Either therefore the lion went away as ſoon as the old Prophet came, as having now done what he ſtayed for; or elſe the Prophet was by the evident proofes he ſaw of Gods over-ruling hand in this buſineſſe, heartened againſt the fear of that beaſt, and ſo took and carried away his body to be buried.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And he laid his carcaſe in his own grave,</hi> &amp;c.] And ſo that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:42229:264"/>
which God had ſaid, verſ. 22. <hi>Thy carcaſe ſhall not come to the ſepulchre of thy fathers.</hi> As for that which followeth, <hi>and they mourned over him, ſaying, Alas my brother:</hi> this was according to the uſuall manner of bewailing their dead friends in thoſe times, Jer. 22.18. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, concerning Jehoiakim the ſonne of Joſiah king of Judah: they ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah my brother, or Ah Siſter, they ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah Lord, or Ah his glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Bury me in the ſepulchre wherein the man of God is buried, lay my bones beſide his bones.]</hi> To wit, that his bones might be ſuffered to lie at reſt, and might not be digged up and burnt by Joſiah, to which end it ſeems alſo, he took order to have a ſuperſcription engraven on the ſepulchre, whereby it might be known, who it was that was buried there, and indeed herein he had his deſire, 2 King. 23.17.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>The cities of Samaria.]</hi> That is, the cities of the kingdome of Iſrael, which was afterwards called the kingdome of Samaria, from a city ſo called, built by Omrie, and which was in his dayes the chief citie of that Kingdome, Chap. 16.24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though the Lord uſed ſuch a ſingular means to reclaim him from his idolatry, yet he ſtill continued therein; one would have thought, that his hand being ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſtrucken dead, and then as miraculouſly healed again, upon the prayers of the prophet, he ſhould preſently with that hand have pulled down his Calves and his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; but neither the withering nor the healing of his hand, nor the cleaving of his altar aſunder, nor this ſtrange death that befell the prophet, whereby the truth of what he had ſpoken was ſingularly confirmed, could do any good to withdraw him from that idolatry, whereby he ſought to aſſure his kingdome to himſelf and his poſteritie: yea indeed, it is like enough, that from this violent death that befell the prophet, he took occaſion to harden himſelf in his evil wayes.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>AT that time Abijah the ſonne of Jeroboam fell ſick.]</hi> That is, in the time of Jeroboams wicked raign, whereof there is mention made in the two laſt verſes of the former chapter: for it is evident, that this is not meant of the time when the man of God was ſlain, as is related in the former chapter, that it ſeems, was in the very beginning of Jeroboams kingdome, this, rather toward the latter end of his reigne, when Ahijah the prophet, who firſt gave him notice of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed to the kingdome, was now blind with old age, verſ. 4. Jeroboam conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his idolatry, and ſo Gods hand was again upon him in the ſickneſſe of this, perhaps his eldeſt ſonne; Rehoboam had a ſonne alſo of the ſame name who ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him both in his crown and in his vices, 2. Chron. 12, 16. But this Abijah the ſonne of Jeroboam, in whom there was ſome goodneſſe, verſ. 13. died of this ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And Jeroboam ſaid to his wife, Ariſe, I pray thee, and diſguiſe thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;.] Why he ſends his wife, and that diſguiſed, may be eaſily conceived: to wit, becauſe he was ſo loath it ſhould be known amongſt the people, that in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie he was glad to ſly to the true prophets of the Lord, that he durſt not truſt
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:42229:264"/>
any body with this ſecret, but the wife that lay in his boſome; but eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was above all unwilling the prophet ſhould know whoſe child it was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom he was enquired of, (as fearing, that out of a deteſtation of his idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous courſes, he would either have refuſed to anſwer them at all, or elſe have given them an anſwer, which they were not willing to heare) and this could not be avoided by ſending any but his wife onely: ſhe might enquire concerning her own child, and yet (being diſguiſed) not be known; another meſſenger muſt have ſaid whoſe child it was, concerning whoſe ſickneſſe they deſired to be ſatisfied, and that Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am would not endure.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels,</hi> &amp;c.] This poore preſent was enjoyned as agreeable to the attire ſhe wore, that ſhe might be thought ſome poore countrymans wife, and not the wife of Jeroboam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſhall tell thee what ſhall become of the child.]</hi> Hereby it is evident, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam ſent to the prophet, onely to know, what the iſſue of his ſonnes ſickneſſe would be; though the miraculous recovery of his withered hand had taught him what wonders might be done by the prayers of a prophet, yet he ſent, not to deſire the prophets prayers for his child, (his obſtinacie in that falſe worſhip he had erected might diſcourage him from hoping for ſuch a favour, either from God, or his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) but onely to know whether his ſonne muſt live or dye.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam,</hi> &amp;c.] By naming her thus before ſhe came in to him, the prophet did, as it were, deride the folly both of her husband and her, that could expect to know of him ſuch a ſecret, as was the event of their ſonnes ſickneſſe; and yet at the ſame time by a diſguiſe, think to hide from him who ſhe was, that came to enquire of him: and ſecondly, he gave her to underſtand how certainly aſſured ſhe might be of the truth of thoſe things, which he had now in charge to ſay to her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Foraſmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] It needs not ſeem ſtrange that God cals the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites his people, notwithſtanding the idolatry that Jeroboam had ſet up amongſt them, if we conſider: firſt, that they were not ſo bad when Jeroboam was exalted to reigne over them, and of theſe times the prophet now ſpeaks: and ſecondly, that even in theſe times, the Lord had a people amongſt them, that were not defiled with Jeroboams idolatry, as we may ſee by this prophet Ahijah, who lived now in Shilo, in the kingdome of Iſrael, and with whom there were many doubtleſſe whoſe hearts ſtill continued upright towards God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Thou haſt not been as my ſervant David, who kept my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, not at all varying from the preſcript rule of Gods law, as concerning the publick worſhip of God, (which was the ſinne now charged upon Jeroboam) yea in all things ſincerely deſiring and endeavouring to do what God of him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>But hast done evil above all that were before thee.]</hi> That is, Saul, and Solomon, yea and perhaps Rehoboam, and Abijah kings of Judah may be included too: for if this were in the latter end of Jeroboams reigne, Rehoboam and Abijah were dead, and Aſa did then ſit in the throne of Judah.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And haſt caſt me behind thy back.]</hi> That is, thou haſt deſpiſed and diſregarded
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:42229:265"/>
me; and indeed this might the better be ſaid of Jeroboam, becauſe he did not onely ſet up idolatry in his kingdome, but did alſo utterly cauſe them to abandon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God in the Temple at Jeruſalem. The phraſe is much like that Nehem. 9.26. <hi>Nevertheleſſe they were diſobedient, and rebelled againſt thee, and caſt thy law behind their backs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And will cut off from Jeroboam him that piſſeth againſt the wall, and him that is ſhut up and left in Iſrael.]</hi> Concerning theſe proverbiall expreſſions, ſee the notes, 1. Sam. 25.22. Deut. 32.36.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And will take away the remnant of the houſe of Jeroboam, as a man taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way dung, till it be all gone.]</hi> That is, the Lord will utterly deſtroy the poſterity of Jeroboam, becauſe he loathes and abhorres them: for two things are implyed in this phraſe: firſt, that dung is not more loathſome to men, then the royall houſe of Jeroboam was to God: and ſecondly, that God would by his judgements make as clean a riddance of them, as men uſually do of dung when they ſweep it out of their houſes, not willing to leave the leaſt ſcrat of it behind. So the like phraſe, Eſa. 14.23. <hi>I will ſweep it with the beſome of destruction, ſaith the Lord:</hi> and Ezek. 26.4. <hi>I will alſo ſcrape her duſt from her, and make her like the top of a rock:</hi> and the accompliſhment of this we have related, chap. 15.29. <hi>And it came to paſſe, when he reigned, that he ſmote all the houſe of Jeroboam, he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, untill he had destroyed him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>When thy feet enter into the citie, the child ſhall die.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, thou ſhalt never ſee thy ſonne more alive: as ſoone as ever thou comeſt to the citie he ſhall die, and as this proves true, ſo be aſſured of the truth of all the reſt I have or ſhall ſay to thee. Some queſtion how this agrees with that verſ. 17. <hi>And when ſhe came to the threſhold of the doore,</hi> (which they underſtand of the doore of her own houſe) <hi>the child died;</hi> and for the reſolving of this doubt, they ſay, that the kings houſe, as being the place of judgement, was in the gate of the citie: but I rather conceive, that the doore mentioned verſ. 17. was the doore of the citie; or, that here onely is foretold, that the child ſhould die when ſhe came to the citie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>The Lord ſhall raiſe him up a king over Iſrael, who ſhall cut off the houſe of Jeroboam that day,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Baaſha; who made a conſpiracy againſt Nadab, the ſonne of Jeroboam, and ſlew him in the ſecond yeare of his reigne, and made himſelf king in his room, chap. 15.27, 28, 29. and preſently deſtroyed all the houſe of Jeroboam. As for the following clauſe, <hi>but what? even now:</hi> the meaning thereof is this, but at what time, and when ſhall this be? ſurely preſently, out of hand: or, as if he ſhould have ſaid; why do I ſpeak of this, as of a thing that ſhall hereafter come to paſſe? ſince the time is in a manner now already come, when it muſt be done: and indeed, if this were foretold in the end of Jeroboams reigne, (as is moſt probable) it was ſpeedily done: for Nadab who ſucceeded his father Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam, had not ſate in the throne of Iſrael above two yeares, when he was ſlain by Baaſha, and together with him, all the houſe of Jeroboam was deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>For the Lord ſhall ſmite Iſrael, as a reed is ſhaken in the water.]</hi> That is, the Lord ſhall continually afflict this kingdome of the ten tribes, both prince and people with unceſſant troubles and warres, both inteſtine and forraigne, ſo that they
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:42229:265"/>
ſhall never abide long in any ſettled condition; and ſo indeed it came paſſe; even as the reeds that grow in the water are continually ſhaken, ſometimes with the blowing of the wind, alwayes with the force of the ſtream that glides along by them; ſo was the kingdome of the ten tribes continually ſhaken, partly, by the frequent transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the crown from one familie to another, one ſtill killing the other, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf king in his room; and partly, by the frequent invaſion of the men of Judah, or ſome other of the neighbouring nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhall ſcatter them beyond the river.]</hi> That is, the river Euphrates, to wit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of Aſſyria, Meſopotamia, and Media, which lay beyond the river, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ten tribes were indeed afterwards carried captives; ſome of them, firſt by Tig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath-pileſer, in the dayes of Pekah king of Iſrael, 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Jeroboams wife aroſe, and departed, and came to Tirzath,</hi> &amp;c.] This Tirzah was an ancient and goodly citie: for here one of the one and thirtie kings, whom Joſhua conquered, did dwell, Joſh. 12.24. and in Solomons time it was famous for the pleaſantneſſe of the ſituation, and ſtatelineſſe of the building; and therefore the Church is hereto compared, Cant. 6.4. <hi>Thou art beautifull, O my love, as Tirzah:</hi> though therefore at firſt Shechem was the royall citie of Jeroboams kingdome, yet afterwards, it ſeems, he built ſome ſtately palace for himſelf in Tirzah, and ſo both he and the other kings of Iſrael, that ſucceeded him, did uſually keep their courts there; yea, till Samaria was built, it ſeems to have been the chief of the royall cities of the kingdome of Iſrael, chap. 15.33. <hi>In the third yeare of Aſa king of Judah, began Baaſha the ſonne of Abijah to reigne over all Iſrael in Tirzah:</hi> ſo alſo chap. 16.6.8, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Iſrael.]</hi> Many things are ſaid to be written in the book of the Chronicles, which we find not in the Scripture Chronicles; and therefore it is commonly held, that this book of the Chronicles here, and elſewhere often mentioned, was ſome other book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah and Iſrael, wherein all the memorable acts and paſſages of thoſe times were exactly recorded; and out of which the penman of the Scripture Chronicles did afterward by the ſpeciall inſtinct and the guidance of the ſpirit of God cull forth ſuch things as are there related, and which the Lord thought requiſite for the edification of the Church in future ages.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And the dayes which Jeroboam reigned, were two and twenty years.]</hi> Jeroboam therefore out-lived Rehoboam who reigned but ſeventeen years, verſ. 21. and Abijam his ſonne who reigned in Jeruſalem but three years, chap. 15.1, 2. and died in the ſecond yeare of Aſa the ſonne of Abijam, chap. 15.25. being ſtricken by the immediate hand of God with ſome remarkable judgement, 2. Chron. 13.20. <hi>Neither did Jeroboam recover ſtrength again in the dayes of Abijah: and the Lord ſtruck him, and he died:</hi> but before this death there was a mighty battel between him and Abijam king of Judah, wherein he loſt five hundred thouſand men; a blow which he never recovered.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Judah did evil in the ſight of the Lord.]</hi> That is, the people of Judah and Rehoboam their king. For, <hi>Three years they walked in the way of David
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:42229:266"/>
and Solomon; doing that which was right in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> 2. Chron. 11.17. as being troubled with the loſſe of the ten tribes of Iſrael; in which time Rehoboam fortified and victualled fifteen cities in Judah and Benjamin, and many other ſtrong holds, and the prieſts and Levites, and other Rehoboam; whereby the kingdome of Judah was much ſtrengthened, 2. Chron. 11.5.17. whereupon <hi>he took eighteen wives, and ſixty concubines,</hi> 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Shiſhak king of Egypt came up againſt Jeruſalem.</hi> &amp;c.] Rehoboams father married the king of Egypts daughter; yet the ſucceeding king of Egypt (invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto perhaps by Jeroboam, who was a while in Egypt before he was king, and now fearing the growing ſtrength of Rehoboam, might lay before Shiſhak the incountable riches of David and Solomon, which might eaſily be had becauſe ten of the twelve tribes were revolted from him) came up againſt Judah with a mighty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, twelve hundred chariots, ſixty thouſand horſemen, and footmen without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: ſome Egyptians, and ſome of other nations, as is expreſſed, 2. Chron. 12.2, 3. and having taken many of their ſtrong cities, at length he went up againſt Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; but the king and princes humbling themſelves upon the Lords meſſage to them by Shemaiah the Prophet, the Lord would not ſuffer him to deſtroy them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly onely Judah henceforth became tributarie to Egypt, and Shiſhak carried away, as a ranſome of the citie, all the treaſures of the Temple, and of the kings houſe, 2. Chron. 12.4, 9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And king Rehoboam made in their ſtead brazen ſhields,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, chap. 10.16. hereby it appears how exceedingly the kingdome of Judah was impoveriſhed by this invaſion of Shiſhak king of Egypt. The Iſraelites of the ten tribes were farre more groſſely idolatrous then thoſe of Judah, and yet the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to live in peace; but theſe of Judah had ſcarce been fallen away two years from the pure worſhip of God, when preſently the Lord did with great ſeveritie afflict them: a clear evidence of Gods more tender care over them for their welfare.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>THree years reigned he in Jeruſalem.]</hi> Abijam began his reigne in the eighteenth yeare of Jeroboam, verſ. 1. and died in the twentieth yeare of his reigne, verſ. 9. whereby it may ſeem that he reigned but two years: but to this I anſwer, that when kings have reigned two complete years, they then begin to write the third yeare of their reigne; and ſo it was with Abijam, the eighteenth yeare of Jeroboam was the firſt yeare of his reigne, the nineteenth yeare of Jeroboam was his ſecond yeare, and the twentieth yeare was his third: and though in that yeare he did, and Aſa his ſonne ſucceeded him, yet having reigned two years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:42229:266"/>
and ſomewhat more, it is ſaid here, that he reigned three years in Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his mothers name was Maachah the daughter of Abiſhalom.]</hi> Rehoboam had eighteen wives, and ſixty concubines, by whom he had eight and twenty ſonnes, and ſixty daughters; but amongſt all his wives he loved this Maachah the mother of Abijam beſt, and therefore allotted him to ſucceed him in the throne, 2. Chron. 11.18, 23. elſewhere ſhe is called <hi>Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah,</hi> 2. Chron. 13.2. and <hi>Maachah the daughter of Abſalom,</hi> 2. Chron. 11.20. Some therefore conceive, that ſhe was the daughter of Tamar, the onely daughter of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom, whoſe husband this Uriel of Gibeah was, &amp; ſo ſhe was the daughter of Uriel, and withall the daughter, that is the grand-child of Abſalom. And this they judge the more probable, becauſe the mother of Abſalom was called Maachah, 2. Sam. 3.3. but indeed the moſt Expoſitours hold, that it was not Abſalom, Davids rebellious ſonne, of whom ſhe was deſcended, but another of that name, called alſo Abiſhalom, as here we have it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And he walked in all the ſinnes of his father,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, of Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam; whereby it is evident, that though Rehoboam and his princes humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord upon the preaching of Shemaiah to them, when the king of Egypt made ſuch a dangerous incurſion into the land of Judah, 2. Chron. 12.6. yet when the king of Egypt was out of his land, he ſoon returned to his former evil wayes, and ſo his ſonne after him trod in his ſteps.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Becauſe David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aſide,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he did not wittingly and preſumptuouſly do any thing wherein he did openly and ſcandalouſly turn aſide from that which God had commanded him, (eſpecially in the point of his government) ſave onely in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Uriah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And there was warre between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the dayes of his life.]</hi> In the ſtory of the reigne of Abijam this is inſerted, concerning the continuall warre which was betwixt his father Rehoboam and Jeroboam; to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that the cauſe of the warre betwixt Abijam and Jeroboam, was the old quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell about the rending away of the ten tribes; this quarrell was not yet appeaſed, there was for this continuall warres betwixt Jeroboam and the houſe of Solomon, firſt, in the dayes of Rehoboam the father; and afterward, in the dayes of Abijam his ſonne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Now the rest of the acts of Abijam,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, chap. 14.19. Some of theſe acts we have alſo recorded in the ſacred Chronicles, as his marrying foureteen wives, by whom he had two and twenty ſonnes, and ſixteen daughters, 2. Chron. 13.21. but eſpecially, that famous battell, which he fought with Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, wherein with foure hundred thouſand men, he encountred and beat Jeroboam, that had in his army eight hundred thouſand, and ſlew of them five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; and then being maſter of the field, recovered Beth-el, Jeſhanah, and Ephraim from him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And fourty and one yeares reigned he in Jeruſalem.]</hi> A long reigne, which was no doubt by the ſpeciall providence of God, that he might have the more time to reform a kingdome ſo exceedingly out of order, as his was when he firſt came to the crown.</p>

                     <hi>And his mothers name was Maachah,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, his grand-mothers: ſee verſ. 2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And he took away the Sodomites out of the land.]</hi> To wit, all that he could diſcover: but ſome remained till his ſonne Jehoſhaphat came to the crown and then he removed them, chap. 22.46.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And alſo Maachah his mother, even her he remooved from being queen,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, from being queen regent; for how elſe ſhe ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved from being queen, I cannot conceive. Abijam the father of Aſa ſitting in the throne not full three yeares complete, it is moſt probable that Aſa was very young when he came to the crown, and that hereupon Maachah his grandmother, once the wife of Rehoboam (his mother happely being dead) was made queen regent, during the kings minoritie: but then Aſa coming to ſome ripeneſſe of yeares, and being well affected in matters of religion, an enemy to the idolatry that was in the land, and deſirous to promote the true worſhip of God: (a thing the more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, becauſe he was trained up under ſuch a guardian) becauſe his grandmother had ſet up ſome new abominable idol in a grove, (and that perhaps contrary to his command, deſpiſing his youth, and exalting her ſelf becauſe of her power as queen regent) he took courage, and aſſuming the government into his own hands, depoſed her from being queen regent any longer; and withall he deſtroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron, which is expreſſed thus, 2. Chron. 15.16. <hi>Aſa cut down her idol, and ſtamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>But the high places were not removed.</hi> That is, the high places wherein the people ſerved and worſhiped the god of Iſrael: thoſe high places which were dedicated to the worſhip of ſtrange gods he took away, 2. Chron. 14.3. but theſe wherein the true God was worſhiped, he removed not; either for feare of the people, or becauſe he conceived there had been no great hurt in them; ſince of old, yea, in the dayes of David, the people had been inured to worſhip there: as for the high places which Solomon built in mount Olivet, ſee the note upon the 2. King. 23.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nevertheleſſe, Aſa his heart was perfect with the Lord all his dayes.]</hi> That is, the whole bent of his heart was ſincerely to do what God required, though through ignorance, or the prevailing of his corruptions, he many times did that which was not approveable, but evil in Gods ſight; and though many of his people ſacrificed in the high places, yet it was altogether without his approbation.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, <hi>ſilver, gold, and veſſels,</hi> 2. Chron. 15.18. It may be probably conceived, that great victory in the battel which he fought with Jeroboam, 2 Chron. 13.17. but not living to perform his vow, his ſonne Aſa did it for him, adding ſomewhat more of his own free gift.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And there was warre between Aſa and Baaſha king of Iſrael all their dayes.]</hi> The firſt ten yeares of his reigne he enjoyed peace, 2. Chron. 14.1. <hi>In his dayes the land was quiet ten yeares,</hi> (the courage and the ſtrength of the ten tribes being much abated, by that great overthrow which Abijam his father had given them) and in this time Aſa reformed thoſe things that were out of order concerning matters of religion, and withall fortified many cities and other places, providing
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:42229:268"/>
for the troubles of warre, in the leiſure of peace; 2. Chron. 14.2, 7. when thoſe ten years of peace were expired, (in which time Jeroboam died, and Nadab his ſonne was ſlain by Baaſha who reigned in his ſtead) ſome enemy or other made warre againſt him, but who it was is not expreſſed; and then afterward about the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeare of his reigne (as is noted upon the 2. Chron. 15.10.) Zerah, who then commanded all the Arabians bordering Judea, invaded his kingdome with an hoſt of a thouſand thouſand, and three hundred chariots; but Aſa encountered them with an army of five hundred and eighty thouſand men, levied out of Judah and Benjamin, and with them overthrew this fearefull multitude, and had the ſpoil both of their cities and camps, 2. Chron. 14.9. &amp;c. and in his return to Jeruſalem, Azariah the Prophet met him, and congratulated this victory, and encouraged him to go on in the ſervice of God; whereupon Aſa put away the remainder of the idols which were yet left in his kingdome; and gathering together Judah and Benjamin, and the Iſraelites of Ephraim, Manaſſeth and Simeon, (which fell to him in abundance, when they ſaw that the Lord his God was with him) in the third moneth of the fifteenth yeare of his reigne, he offered much of the ſpoil in ſacrifices, and made a ſolemne covenant with God, 2. Chron. 15.11, 12. &amp;c. all this time the Iſraelites attempted nothing againſt Judah that we read of. But now when Baaſha perceived how potent Aſa began to be, and how faſt the Iſraelites revolted to him, and how they had entred into a covenant with them of Judah, he began to arm againſt Aſa; and becauſe after this, his warre with Aſa never ceaſed all his dayes, or becauſe even before this, there was no peace betwixt them, but both ſides prepared for warre, therefore it is here ſaid, that <hi>there was warre betwixt Aſa and Baaſha all their dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Baaſha king of Iſrael went up against Judah, and built Ramah,</hi> &amp;c.] Having it ſeems gotten Ramah from the king of Iudah (for Ramah was one of Benjamins cities, Joſh. 18.25.) fearing the greatneſſe of Aſa, and the revolt of the Iſraelites to him, 2. Chro. 15.9. he endeavoured to block him up, and to keep his own people from flying away to him, by fortifying Ramah, and putting a garriſon in it, which lay in the way between Jeruſalem towards Samaria; and this was done about the thirteenth yeare of Baaſha his reigne, which was the ſixteenth yeare of the reigne of Aſa, and the ſix and thirtieth yeare of the kingdome of Judah, to wit, ſince it was divided from that of Iſrael; for ſo that place muſt be underſtood, 2. Chron. 16.1. as is there noted.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Then Aſa took all the ſilver and the gold that were left in the treaſures of the houſe of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, ſince Shiſhak king of Egypt carried away the treaſures of the Temple, chap. 14.25, 16. and thus was Solomons Temple twice robbed of its treaſures, within the compaſſe of foure and thirty years or thereabout: we cannot ſay whether this Ben-hadad to whom Aſa ſent theſe treaſures, was the grand child of Rezon, who became a king of Damaſcus in Solomons dayes, chap. 11.23. (as ſome conceive; affirming Rezon to be the ſame that is here called Hezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) or whether he were the ſonne of Hadad the Edomite, that became an adverſary to Solomon, and at length became king of Damaſcus, and was therefore called Ben-hadad, as others hold: But doubtleſſe a great ſinne this was in Aſa, that he ſhould rob the Temple of God, therewith to hire an infidell to break the covenant that he
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:42229:269"/>
had made with the Iſraelites their brethren, and to make warre with them; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we conſider what a wonderfull victory God had lately given him over that innumerable hoſt of the Ethiopians and the Lubims; and indeed, after ſo great and memorable a proof of Gods readineſſe to help him, he did ſo farre diſtruſt God, as to hire a heathen perfidiouſly to invade the Iſraelites: the prophet Hanani was ſent to him to reprove him ſharply, and to make known Gods diſpleaſure againſt him, as is largely related, 2. Chron. 16.7. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And ſmote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth.]</hi> Abel-beth-maachah is called Abel-maim, 2. Chron. 16.4. and Cinneroth is that which is called in the new Teſtament <hi>the land of Geneſereth,</hi> Matth. 14.34.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>He left off building of Ramah,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to go and withſtand Benhadad; and ſo, when he had ſecured his land againſt him, then as it is ſaid in the next words, <hi>he dwelt in Tirzah,</hi> that is, there he abode quietly, without ſeeking any revenge againſt Aſa.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And they took away the ſtones of Ramah, and the timber thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, whileſt Baaſha was gone thence to defend his countrey againſt Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad, the men of Judah and Benjamin came and took away both ſtones and timber, and therewith built two cities of Benjamin, Geba and Mizpah. And this Aſa choſe rather to do, then to ſeiſe upon Ramah, and fortifie it for his own uſe; either, becauſe he feared leſt Baaſha ſhould return again before the work was finiſhed; or, becauſe he was loth there ſhould be in that place any ſuch ſtrong hold, knowing how prejudiciall it would be to the kings of Judah, if the kings of Iſrael ſhould hereafter get it into their poſſeſſion; or rather, becauſe he conceived theſe might be made more defenſable places then Ramah could be; for that he did fortifie theſe two towns of Geba and Mizpah, for fear of Baaſha, is evident, Jerem. 41.9. where we reade of a pit that Aſa had in Mizpah, that continued it ſeems unto the captivitie, and was doubtleſſe ſome trench, or ſome place made for the receit of water, in caſe it ſhould be beſieged, <hi>the pit wherein Iſhmael had caſt all the dead bodies of the men (whom he had ſlain, becauſe of Gedaliah) was it, which Aſa the king had made for feare of Baaſha,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Nevertheleſſe, in the time of his old age he was diſeaſed in his feet,</hi> &amp;c. To wit, in the three laſt yeares of his reigne: for when Hanani the Prophet had reproved him, for ſeeking help from the king of Syria; he not onely caſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet into priſon, but alſo at the ſame time oppreſſed ſome of the people (ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as ſhewed their diſlike of theſe his courſes,) wherefore the Lord in the nine and thirtieth yeare of his reigne, impriſoned him; ſtriking him with moſt grievous pains of the gout in his feet; and when in his ſickneſſe he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians, about two yeares after he dyed, 2. Chron. 16.7, 13. having ſeene ſeven kings of Iſrael; to wit, Jeroboam, Nadab, Baaſha, Elah, Zimri, Omri, and Ahab.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And Aſa ſlept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers,</hi> &amp;c.] And that with great magnificence, 2. Chron. 16.14. <hi>And they buried him in his own ſepulchre which he had made for himſelf in the citie of David, and laid him in the bed, which was filled with ſweet odours and divers kinds of ſpices prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Apothecaries art, and they made a very great burning for him.</hi>
                  </p>

&amp;c.] This Gibbethon belonged to the tribe of Dan, Joſh. 19.41. and was in the dayes of David and Solomon in the Iſraelites poſſeſſion: but now it ſeems the Philiſtines had gotten it, and whileſt Nadab laid ſiege againſt it that he might recover it, he was treacherouſly ſlaine by Baaſha; and ſo the ſiege it ſeems was raiſed: for twenty ſix yeares after, or thereabouts, the ſonne of Baaſha did again lay ſiege to this citie as we may ſee, chap. 16.15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>Becauſe of the ſinnes of Jeroboam,</hi> &amp;c.] So that the idolatry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Jeroboam thought to have continued the kingdome to him and his poſterity, was the very cauſe why his whole family was rooted out, and the kingdome was transferred to another.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen the word of the Lord came to Jehu the ſonne of Hanani, againſt Baaſha.]</hi> This Jehu was the ſame Prophet that afterwards was ſent to Jehoſhaphat, to reprove him for his league with Ahab, 2. Chron, 19.2. and that wrote a book of the Chronicles of thoſe times, 2 Chron. 20.34. and his father Hanani was he that reproved Aſa for ſeeking to Benhadad for aid againſt Baaſha, 2. Chron. 16.7. ſo that the father and the ſonne were both at the ſame time the known Prophets of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And alſo by the hand of the prophet Jehu the ſonne of Hanani, came the word of the Lord againſt Baaſha,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive that this hath reference to the judgement denounced againſt Jeroboam by Ahijah, chap. 14.6. &amp;c. as if it had been ſaid, as the word of the Lord came by Ahijah againſt Jeroboam; ſo alſo by Jehu againſt Baaſha. But I rather think that the meaning of this clauſe is onely this; that before the death of Baaſha, Jehu did his meſſage as God had commanded. The ſame words are here again repeated, which we had before, verſ. 1. but there they are to ſhew what God gave in charge to the Prophet, here their drift is to ſhew, that accordingly the Prophet delivered his meſſage, as the Lord had enjoyned him; and that <hi>for all the evil that he did,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in being like to the houſe of Jeroboam, and becauſe he killed him:</hi> that is, his lord Nadab, the ſonne of Jeroboam, as is expreſſed before, chap. 15.27. for though Baaſha did herein what God had decreed, yet he had no command from God for it, but did it onely to get the kingdome; and therefore it was treaſon now in him, as it was afterward alſo in Jehu, when he ſlew Ahabs poſterity; becauſe he aimed onely at himſelf therein, though he had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, Hoſ. 1.4. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe at that day, that I will break the bow of Iſrael, in the valley of Jezreel, and will avenge the blood of Jezreel, upon the houſe of Jehu:</hi> And indeed, that the judgement which fell upon Baaſha, was partly for his murdering of Nadab, we may ſee by the Lords dealing with him, juſt as he dealt with the houſe of Jeroboam; for as he ſlew the ſonne of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, when he had yet ſat in the throne of Iſrael not full two complete yeares; and that whileſt he was laying ſiege againſt Gibbethon, and then immediately, deſtroyed all the reſt of his family, chap. 15.27, 28, 29. ſo Zimri ſlew the ſonne of Baaſha, when he had reigned not full two complete yeares, as is ſaid here verſ. 8. and that too, whileſt his army lay encamped againſt Gibbethon, verſ. 15. and then immediately cut off all the reſt of his family and friends, verſ. 11.12.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And it came to paſſe when he began to reigne, as ſoon as he ſat on his throne, that he ſlew all the houſe of Baaſha,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he ſlew all his family, kinsfolks, and friends, that there might be none to avenge his death, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, that he might not be prevented; as indeed he had been, if he had not done it ſpeedily; for within few dayes he himſelf came to an untimely end, verſ. 18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>In provoking the Lord God of Iſrael to anger with their vanities,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, with their idols; for ſo the idol-gods of all idolatours, are uſually called in the Scripture; partly, becauſe they have nothing of a God in them, their deitie wholly conſiſting in the idolatrous vain opinion: <hi>We know that an idol is nothing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>In the twenty and ſeventh yeare of Aſa king of Judah, did Zimri reigne ſeven dayes,</hi> &amp;c.] Accounting, as is moſt likely to the time that Omri was proclaimed king in the camp, as is related in the following verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>He went into the pallace of the kings houſe, and burnt the kings houſe over him with fire,</hi> &amp;c.] That ſo, firſt, Omri might never enjoy that ſtately palace of Tirzah: and ſecondly, that neither living nor dead, he might fall into the hands of his inſulting adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>For his ſinnes which he ſinned in doing evil in the ſight of the Lord, in walking in the way of Jeroboam,</hi> &amp;c.] For though he reigned but ſeven dayes, ere Omri was proclaimed by the ſouldiers, yet perhaps it was longer ere he was forced to burn himſelf; and beſide, within the ſpace of thoſe ſeven dayes, he might by his edicts make known to the people his reſolution to continue the worſhip of Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams calves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Half of the people followed Tibni the ſonne of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.]</hi> It ſeems the people (miſliking that the ſouldiers ſhould take upon them to chooſe their king) choſe this Tibni to be their king; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom and Omri, there was continuall warres for three years, and upward; each party ſtriving to aſſure the crown to him whom they had elected, till at length Omri prevailed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>In the thirtie and one yeare of Aſa king of Judah, began Omri to reigne,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, then he was fully and peaceably ſettled in the kingdome: in the ſeven and twentieth yeare of Aſa was he firſt choſen king by the army at Gibbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, verſ. 15, 19. but for well nigh foure years after, Tibni that was choſen by the people, ſtrove with him for the kingdome; ſo that till the one and thirtieth yeare of Aſa, he was not ſettled in the throne of Iſrael: yet becauſe he was firſt made king
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:42229:270"/>
when he ſlew Zimri, therefore it is added, <hi>he reigned twelve yeares:</hi> to wit, from his firſt election; for otherwiſe, if we account his reigne from the one and thirtieth yeare of Aſa, when he was ſettled in the throne, to the eight and thirtieth yeare of Aſa when he dyed, and his ſonne Ahab ſucceeded him, verſ. 29. it is manifeſt then, that he reigned according to that account but eight yeares.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And he bought the hill Samaria,</hi> &amp;c.] This is given as the reaſon why it is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, that he had reigned but <hi>ſix yeares in Tirzah:</hi> it was becauſe Zimri having burnt the royall pallace in Tirzah, Omri bought the hill which was called Samaria of Shemer the owner of it, and thereon built the citie Samaria, which he made his royall citie, the metropolis of his kingdome; and ſo the other ſix yeares of his reigne he lived there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>For he walked in all the way of Jereboam,</hi> &amp;c.] If he onely continued in the ſinnes of Jeroboam, how is this rendered as a reaſon of that which is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the former verſe, that <hi>he did worſe then all that were before him:</hi> ſurely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having ſeen ſuch fearefull effects of Gods wrath againſt the former kings of Iſrael for this their idolatry, he notwithſtanding continued obſtinately therein, as it were purpoſely to provoke the Lord; yea and happely did, with more violence, force and preſſe the people to that idolatry: whence we ſee there is mention made, Mich. 6.16. of <hi>the ſlatutes of Omri;</hi> to wit, concerning that their idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the golden calves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>He took to wife Jezabel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, and went and ſerved Baal,</hi> &amp;c.] This wife of Ahabs proved a moſt wicked wretch, and a cruell ſcourge to the people of God: we ſee Jehu complained of her witchcrafts and whoredomes, 2 Kings 9.22. and it is often mentioned, that ſhe was the great perſecutour of Gods prophets, and the great promoter of the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of Baal in the land; and therefore it is that S. John cals that falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſe, that in his time in the Church of Thyatira, had ſeduced many to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and idolatry, <hi>Jezabel,</hi> Revel. 2.20. Baal it ſeems was the god of the Zidoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and ſo Ahab, marrying a wife from thence, did ſoon ſet up his wives god in the land of Iſrael: Now this idolatry was farre worſe then that of Jeroboams; for in that though they had idols, to wit, the golden calves, yet in them they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the worſhip of the true God: but in the other they worſhipped Baal as their god; as is evident in that of Elijah to the Iſraelites, chap. 18.21. <hi>If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him:</hi> and ſo again, verſ. 27. <hi>Cry aloud, for he is a god,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>In his dayes did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho,</hi> &amp;c.] This is here added to ſhew, how many yeares after the curſe which Joſhua denounced, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, Joſh. 6.26. and that happely the rather, as an inſtance of the horrible profaneneſſe and contempt of God in theſe dayes of Ahab: for though Jericho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the tribe of Benjamin, yet it was at this time, it ſeems, under the power of the king of the ten tribes. Hitherto Jericho had continued a heap of rubbiſh, no man daring to hazard that curſe, by rebuilding of it; but now this bold wretch <hi>Hiel the Beth-elite:</hi> that is, that dwelt in Beth-el, undertook the work, and paid dearly for it, as Joſhua had threatned. See the note, upon Joſh. 6.26.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Elijah the Tiſhbite, who was of the Inhabitants of Gilead, ſaid unto Ahab,</hi> &amp;c.] Of all the Prophets that God raiſed up in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael, we find not any, of whom ſo many ſtrange paſſages are recorded, both for his courage and miracles, as there are of Elijah; and therefore at the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration of Chriſt, Matth. 17, 3. Elijah as chief of the prophets appeared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Moſes talking with Chriſt; to ſignifie, that both Moſes and the prophets had in their ſeverall ſeaſons given teſtimony to Chriſt. The people of Iſrael were never ſo corrupt as they were at this time; (for now the worſhip of Baal was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the land, and the worſhip of the true God was quite diſregarded, and the prophets and ſervants of God, that would not bow to Baal, were perſecuted and ſlain, as Elijah complaines, chap. 19.10.) and yet there were never more prophets ſent unto them, then there was at that time, (we ſee that Obadiah hid an hundred of them in caves, chap. 18.13.) nor never more glorious prophets as we ſee amongſt the reſt in this Elijah, a man of tranſcendent courage and zeal (as ſitted for theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt times;) whence it is ſaid of the Baptiſt, who in his miniſtery was alſo fiery and fervent, Luke 1.17. <hi>And he ſhall go before him in the ſpirit, and in the power of Elias,</hi> &amp;c. Againſt Ahab and Jezabels zeal to promote Idolatry, the Lord raiſed up a prophet that ſhould be as zealous for the oppoſing of their idolatry and the defence of Gods true worſhip; as we ſee in this his firſt encounter with Ahab, <hi>As the Lord God of Iſrael liveth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>before whom I stand;</hi> that is, whom I continually ſerve, (according to that in Deut. 10.8. <hi>The Lord ſeparated the tribe of Levito beare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to ſtand before the Lord</hi>) or in whoſe preſence I now am, who is therefore a witneſſe of the truth of that which I ſay, <hi>there ſhall not be dew nor rain theſe yeares, but according to my word,</hi> that is, there ſhall not be dew nor rain theſe enſuing yeares, till I from the Lord ſhall ſay, that again it ſhall rain. Elijah moved with the horrible wickedneſſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab and Jezabel; and particularly perhaps with their contempt and ſcorn of Gods prophets, did it ſeemes by the inſtinct of Gods ſpirit, pray that the Lord would ſhut up the heavens for ſome yeares, and not ſuffer it to rain till he ſought unto God that it might rain; that ſo the wrath of God againſt the iniquitie of thoſe times might be diſcovered; and the pretious account he makes of his Prophets might be manifeſted; and being by the ſame ſpirit of God aſſured, that his prayer was heard: he came to Ahab and threatned him before hand (as is here expreſſed, that he might ſee it was of God) with this approaching drought; and as he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it came to paſſe; for three yeares and ſix moneths it rained not, Jam. 5.17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Turn thee eastward, and hide thy ſelf by the brook Cherith,</hi> &amp;c. When Elijah was gone from Ahab, or at leaſt, when Ahab began to ſee there was no rain indeed for a long time, as Elijah had ſaid, he began to be nettled with his words, and enraged againſt the Prophet and ſtirred up thereto, no doubt, by Jezabel, ſent preſently out to take him, that he might be revenged on him: as Obadiah afterwards told him, chap. 18.10. <hi>As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation nor king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome whither my lord hath not ſent to ſeek thee:</hi> but the Lord foreſeeing what would be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave his Prophet warning of it, and appointed him to withdraw and hide himſelf by the brook Cherith; there being doubtleſſe in that place, ſome woods
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:42229:271"/>
or caves, where it was likely the Prophet might ſome good time conceal himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.]</hi> That is, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and will take order that the ravens ſhall bring thee competent food thither: and the reaſons given by Expoſitours, why the Lord was pleaſed to make uſe of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens in this ſervice, rather then any other creature, are theſe: Firſt, becauſe ravens do naturally delight to live in ſuch places as this was, by the brook Cherith, where Elijah was appointed to hide himſelf, to wit, in ſolitary places, where there are caves and vaults, eſpecially in valleys, where there are brooks of water, whence is that, Prov. 30.17. <hi>The eye that mocketh at his father, the ravens of the valley ſhall pick it out:</hi> Secondly, becauſe they are a theeviſh kind of birds, watching all occaſions to ſnatch up and carry away pigeons, and chickens, or any other proviſion they can any where come at: And thirdly, eſpecially becauſe the ravens being ſuch a greedy and ravenous bird, that as it is ſaid, they uſually diſregard the feeding of their own young ones, to feed themſelves, it was the more miraculous that God ſhould make them caterers for Elijah, in ſuch an orderly manner to bring him in his proviſion both morning and evening; hereby the power of God was the more clearly diſcovered, and a plain proof was given by what contrary means God can provide for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in all their ſtraits: God might have ſent Elijah to his fellow Prophets in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiahs caves, or to ſome other of thoſe faithfull Iſraelites, that had not bowed their knees to Baal; but he choſe rather by this unlikely way to provide for him, that it might be ſeen that God hath all creatures at his command for the help of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: it was no leſſe ſtrange to feed him by ravens, then if he had ſuſtained him without any food at all; and yet this God did, cauſing the ravens to bring him both morning and evening, <hi>bread and fleſh,</hi> to wit, roſted or ſod; the Lord directing them where they ſhould have it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And it came to paſſe after a while, that the brook dried up.]</hi> God could eaſily have prevented this brook from drying up, notwithſtanding the drought; but the Lord was pleaſed rather now to find out another way for the ſuſtaining of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, to wit, Firſt, that he might for a while, by the drying up of this brook, try the faith of the Prophet: Secondly, that the Iſraelites in thoſe parts might be the more ſtraitened for want of water: Thirdly, that he might the more abundantly manifeſt how many ſeverall wayes he had to provide for his ſervants in times of extremitie: And fourthly, that he might together with him, provide for the poore widow of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephath too. Some Expoſitours hold, that there had been no rain for half a yeare when this brook dried up, and that afterward Elijah lived with the widow of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephath three yeares (which is the full time of the drought, Luke 4.25.) and that therefore it is ſaid in the beginning of the next chapter, that <hi>in the third yeare,</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah was ſent to Ahab with a promiſe of rain.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Ariſe, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to ſuſtain thee.]</hi> There is not the leaſt intimation of any want of rain that was in the land of Judah; yet was Elijah ſent to a ſtranger rather then to the widows of Iſrael, both becauſe ſuch an one might ſeem moſt unlikely to relieve him, and alſo herein to ſhadow forth Gods future mercie to the Gentiles, the Jews being rejected; whence is that of our Saviour, Luke 4.25, 26. <hi>Many widows were in Iſrael in the dayes of Elias,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But unto
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:42229:272"/>
none of them was Elias ſent, ſave unto Sarepta a citie of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow:</hi> as for that phraſe, <hi>I have commanded a widow,</hi> ſee the note above, verſ. 4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>The widow woman was there gathering of ſticks, and he called to her,</hi> &amp;c.] As knowing by the ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods Spirit, that this was the widow of whom God had ſpoken to him; or elſe, having received direction hereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the widow to whom he was ſent, when he came to the citie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake,</hi> &amp;c.] This widow living upon the borders of Iſrael, had learnt to know a Prophet of Iſrael by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: yea, as it may ſeem, both to know and fear the God of Iſrael: and yet to ſuch a ſtrait ſhe was brought, being a poore woman, (though the drought had been yet, as it is thought, but ſix moneths in the land) that had not God come in to her help at this pinch, ſhe was now ready to eat her laſt meal: <hi>I have</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of meal in a barrell, and a little oyl in a cruſe, and behold I am gathering two ſticks,</hi> that is a few ſticks, as we uſe to ſay, a ſtick or two, <hi>that I may go in, and dreſſe it for me and my ſonne, that we may eat it, and die;</hi> however hereby it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the drought and famine was in the countrey of Tyre and Sidon, as well as amongſt the Iſraelites: and indeed, being it was ſent upon the Iſraelites for that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of Baal, which Jezebel the daughter of the king of the Zidonians had brought in amongſt them, no marvell though the Zidonians were involved in the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together with them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Fear not, go, and do as thou haſt ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Go in and dreſſe thy meal and thy oyl for thee and thy ſonne; but then withall ſhe is enjoyned, firſt, to feed him with her laſt victualls, and then after to provide for her ſelf and her ſon: <hi>but make me thereof a little cake firſt,</hi> which was doubtleſſe for the triall of her faith, as concerning that promiſe which he addes in the following verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And ſhe, and he, and her houſe did eat many dayes.]</hi> That is, a long time together; and indeed it is the judgement of ſome Expoſitours, as was noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that for three full years they all lived upon this poore remainder of the widows meal and oyle, which makes the miracle farre the more wonderfull; but yet this may be ſpoken with relation to ſome part of this time, and happely to the time of her ſonnes falling ſick, which is next related, verſ. 17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And his ſickneſſe was ſo ſore, that there was not breath left in him.]</hi> This is mentioned becauſe hereby the widdow perceived that her ſonne was dead: for that he was indeed dead, and was not onely fallen into a ſwoun, is evident in many following paſſages, as verſ. 18. and 20. where the widow and the Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan that God had ſlain her ſonne; and verſ. 21. where it is ſaid, that Eliah prayed, <hi>My God I pray thee let this childs ſoul come into him again:</hi> and then again, ver. 22. <hi>And the ſoul of the child came into him again and he revived;</hi> which may alſo be confirmed by that of the Apoſtle, Heb. 10.35. which many think was written, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with reference to this ſtory, <hi>Women received their dead raiſed to life again,</hi> this being the firſt we reade of in the Scriptures, that being dead, was reſtored again to life.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And ſhe ſaid unto Elijah. What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, wherein have I offended thee? or whence is it that thou a holy
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:42229:272"/>
Prophet of the Lord ſhouldeſt come to me a mere ſtranger to thee, thus to puniſh me for my ſinnes? wherefore art thou come to me? <hi>art thou come to call my ſinnes to Gods remembrance,</hi> and ſo to move him <hi>to kill my ſonne?</hi> to what end were our lives ſaved when we were in danger to periſh for want of food, if now my ſonne muſt die with ſickneſſe? when God puniſheth thoſe for their ſinnes, whom a while he did forbear, he is ſaid in the Scripture to remember their ſinnes, 1. Sam. 15.2. Now the conſcience of this poore widow telling her, that the death of her ſonne was for her ſinnes, and therefore apprehending that his dwelling with her had been accidentally, through her not profiting by his preſence as ſhe ought to have done, the occaſion of her ſonnes death; or rather, that he had beſought God thus to puniſh her, as by his prayer he had brought the drought and famine upon the land; or that he was ſent as the miniſter of Gods wrath to take away her ſonne from her; hence it was that ſhe break forth into this impatient bewailing her loſſe, and her ſinnes that had been the cauſe of it: the expreſſion ſhe uſeth, is much like that of Peter, when the ſhip began to ſink, Luke 5.8. <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinfull man O Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>O Lord my God, haſt thou alſo brought evil upon the widow, with whom I ſojourn by ſlaying her ſonne?]</hi> Herein the Prophet pleads, firſt, his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God. <hi>O Lord my God:</hi> ſecondly, the condition of the woman, <hi>a widdow,</hi> and that becauſe women in that eſtate are leaſt able to endure the loſſe of thoſe that ſhould be a ſtay and ſupport to them, and God is wont to be very compaſſionately tender over them: and thirdly, the intereſt ſhe had in him, becauſe he ſojourned with her, as grieving that the woman that had harboured him ſo long, and for whoſe preſervation God had wrought ſo great a miracle, ſhould now have all her joy daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a ſad loſſe; or that it ſhould be ſaid by any, that it had been well for her, if the Prophet had never come into her houſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And he ſtretched himſelf upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, either that he ſtretched himſelf upon the child, and ſo in that poſture of body prayed, and then left off again, doing this three ſeverall times; or elſe, rather, that he ſtretched himſelf upon the child, and then went and prayed unto the Lord, and ſo did by turns three ſeverall times: however, doubtleſſe his ſtretching himſelf upon the child, was partly, that feeling the coldneſſe of the childs body, he might be ſtirred up thereby to pray the more earneſtly for him; and partly, that he might perceive when heat and life begun to come into the child; and partly alſo, thereby to expreſſe his exceeding grief for the death of the child, and his earneſt deſire that God would be pleaſed to reſtore him to life; there being an intimation in this geſture of his, that he could have been glad to infuſe of his own life into the child, and that to move the Lord, the rather, to heare his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and grant his requeſt; the like we reade of Eliſha, 2. Kings 4.34. and of Paul to Eutichus, Acts 20.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the woman ſaid to Elijah, Now by this I know thou art a man of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c.] That is, now her faith was ſtrengthened concerning this; ſhe had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him a man of God, verſ. 18. yet perhaps her faith was ſhaken with the death of her child, and now with this miracle it was ſtrengthened again.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THe word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third yeare.]</hi> Elijah was ſent to Ahab, not long before the Lord ſent rain again upon the earth; ſo that from the firſt begining of the drought unto this time, when the Prophet was ſent to Ahab, it was well nigh three yeares and ſix moneths complete; for ſo long rain was with-held, Luk. 4.25. either therefore, the third yeare here ſpoken of muſt be the third yeare from his firſt hiding of himſelf, chap. 17.3. or the third yeare ſince he went to ſojourne with the widdow of Zarephath, chap. 17.6. or elſe the third complete yeare ſince the time they began to want rain, the ſix odd moneths not being reckoned, as indeed it is uſuall in the Scripture, in noting times to ſet down onely the full complete yeares, and not to mention the odd moneths or dayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Go ſhew thy ſelf unto Ahab, and I will ſend rain upon the earth.]</hi> Though the Iſraelites continued in their idolatry ſtill, yet the Lord determined to take off that judgement of want of rain, that now for three years and a half had been upon them: and this he did, partly for his righteous ſervants ſake, that were ſtill in the land who could not but ſuffer much in this common calamitie; and partly, becauſe the Lord intended by Elijah, to bring Baals prophets to be ſlain by the people; and ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to remove the judgement he had brought upon the kingdome: and ſo now Elijah was ſent to give notice they ſhould have rain, and ſo that which he ſaid to Ahab might be made good; to wit, that there ſhould be no rain but according to his word; yea, and withall doubtleſſe, God gave him now in charge, (though it be not here expreſt) what he afterwards did, concerning the challenge he made to Baals prophets, as is evident by that which he ſaith, verſ. 36. <hi>Lord God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iſrael, let it be known this day, that thou art God in Iſrael, and that I am thy ſervant, and that I have done all theſe things at thy word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Obadiah feared the Lord greatly.]</hi> But how could this be, if he went not up to Jeruſalem to ſacrifice? I anſwer, ſo long as he did ſincerely feare God, and yielded him that ſpirituall ſervice, which was required of him, and kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pure from the idolatry of the place and times wherein he lived, and could not be ſuffered to go to Jeruſalem, without the loſſe of his life, God was pleaſed to diſpence with the omiſſion of that legall ceremoniall ſervice: or at leaſt to beare with his children that did truly feare him and daily ſerve him in ſpirit and truth, though they did not hazard both libertie and lives for the legall ceremonies: the like may be ſaid of thoſe other faithfull ſervants of God, that lived at this time in the kingdome of Iſrael, chap. 19.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4, <hi>Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.]</hi> By this may be meant any neceſſary food; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this time of famine, it was much to provide them even bread and water.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Peradventure we may find graſſe to ſave the horſes,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby it is evident; that their chiefeſt want was of paſtures and water for their cattell: ſome ſmall pittance of food for themſelves, the neighbouring countreys might afford for money; but graſſe for the cattell could not be had but in their own land.</p>

thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Expoſitours, by the ſeverall nations and kingdomes whither Ahab had ſent to ſearch for Elijah, underſtand the ſeverall tribes of Iſrael, that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his government; of which, (ſay they) he ſpeaks, as of divers kingdomes and nations, becauſe of old, that land was the ſeat of divers kings and people: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I conceive it to be an hyperbolicall ſpeech, as when we uſe to tell thoſe whom with great diligence we have ſought for in many ſeverall places, that we have looked for them all the world over: and that the drift of this expreſſion was to imply, that Ahab had ſought for him not onely in the land of Iſrael, but alſo in all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring countreys, and amongſt all the nations that were in league with him; for though it follows, that upon deniall, that they knew not where he was, <hi>he took an oath of the kingdome and nation, that they found thee not:</hi> the meaning of that may be, that he preſſed them ſo farre, that he reſted not, till by an oath they confirmed it, that they knew nothing of him: his own people he might conſtrain to ſwear, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were not his ſubjects he could not; yet by importuning them to deale tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, he might draw them to it; and therefore ſpeaking of both joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he uſeth the ſame phraſe of both, <hi>he took an oath,</hi> &amp;c. and indeed for the neighbouring nations where there was no rain, that might make them as earneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Elijah as Ahab was: how he could be concealed in Zarephath when ſo ſtrict a courſe was taken, we need not queſtion; conſidering, that being informed of his danger, the widow might uſe many wayes to hide him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord ſhall carry thee whither I know not.]</hi> That is, ſome Angel, or wind from the Lord ſhall take thee up and carry thee to ſome other place, and then the king will ſlay me, either, becauſe I did not apprehend thee when I ſaw thee; or, becauſe I ſhall ſeem to have deluded him, by telling him that which he ſhall not find to be true: uſually it ſeems in thoſe times Elijah was thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly caught up, (and ſo perhaps other prophets too) and carried from one place to an other; whence it was, that when Elijah was at laſt taken up into heaven, the young prophets would needs ſend out to ſeek him, 2. Kings 2.16. and the like we read alſo concerning Philip, when he had baptized the Ethiopian Eunuch, Act. 8.39. Now this is ſtill ſaid to have been done by the ſpirit of the Lord; either, becauſe it was done by the miniſtery of the Angels, or by ſome mighty extraordinary wind (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed concerning Elijahs laſt rapture, it is ſaid, 2. King. 2.11. <hi>That Elijah went up by a whirle-wind into heaven;</hi> or, rather, becauſe what was done by any ſecret ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall working of God, they uſed to ſay it was done by the ſpirit of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ, 15. <hi>As the Lord of hoſts liveth, before whom I ſtand,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note chap. 17.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Art thou he that troubles Iſrael?]</hi> This Ahab ſaid to Elijah, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he had alwayes oppoſed that way of religion and worſhip which he had eſtabliſhed in the land, and diſſwaded the people from ſubmitting to it; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, becauſe by his meanes he conceived the drought and famine was ſent, which had ſorely diſtreſſed the land.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Now therefore ſend, and gather to me all Iſrael unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal,</hi> &amp;c.] There is no likelyhood that Elijah immediately upon that reproofe, in the former verſe, enjoyned Ahab to gather the prophets of Baal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:42229:274"/>
never acquainting him to what end and purpoſe they ſhould be aſſembled, and that the king without any more words did preſently what Elijah required: and therefore doubtleſſe (though it be not here expreſſed, becauſe it may be eaſily gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the following relation of that which was afterward done) after ſome vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concertations betwixt the prophet and the king, concerning the idolatry of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the king defending what he had done; Elijah did now propound to him that way of tryall, to find out the truth which afterward again he propounded to the people, verſ. 22, 23, 24. which the king approving, accepted the challenge; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled both the prophets of Baal, and the people alſo: that is, the heads of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſee what was done, as Elijah had required. The foure hundred and fifty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of Baal here mentioned were, it ſeems, ſuch as were diſperſed over the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and towns of Iſrael; the foure hundred diſtinguiſhed from the other by this title, <hi>the prophets of the groves,</hi> were ſuch as attended the court, and performed their idolatrous ſervice in the groves planted by Ahab, near Baals temple in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, chap. 16.32, 33. and are therefore ſaid to have been ſuch as did <hi>eat at Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels table:</hi> why Carmel was choſe to be the place where this great triall was to be made, we cannot ſay; onely it is like, he purpoſely declined Samaria, that Jezebel might not hinder the work: for as for that conceit of the papiſts, that in Carmel Elijah uſed to live a retired monaſticall life, whence an order of their Friers are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Carmelites, it is a mere phancie and groundleſſe conceit.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>So Ahab ſent unto all the children of Iſrael, and gathered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets together,</hi> &amp;c.] We need not wonder that Ahab ſhould herein do as Elijah had required, if we conſider, firſt, That doubtleſſe Elijah had deſired that triall might be made, whether the ſacrifice of the Baalites, or his ſacrifice, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fire from heaven; to diſcover thereby whether Baal were a god or no; and to ſee this tried by ſuch a miraculous work, the very naturall deſire that is in men to ſee ſtrange things, might winne him; beſide the confidence he had in Baal: and ſecondly, That being curbed with the judgement of God, (the drought) that now lay upon the whole land, the hope of being relieved herein, muſt needs make him the more flexible to yield to the prophets deſire; and beſides, God might at this time powerfully over-awe his ſpirit: indeed we find not in the ſequele of the ſtory, that the prophets of the groves were preſent, (whom Elijah had alſo deſired him to call thither) but onely the foure hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, verſ. 22. <hi>I, even I, onely remain a prophet of the Lord, but Baals prophets are foure hundred and fifty men;</hi> and therefore many Expoſitours hold, that Jezebel would not ſuffer them to be there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>How long halt ye between two opinions?]</hi> They are ſaid to halt in the profeſſion of their religion, that do not walk uprightly and exactly, according to the rules of that religion, which they muſt needs do, that in ſome things follow one religion, and in ſome things another; ſuch men can be exact in neither, and are therefore ſaid to <hi>halt betwixt two opinions;</hi> ſometimes inclining to one, ſometimes to another; as the body of him that halts doth bend ſometimes to the right hand and ſometimes to the left: and ſo it was now with the Iſraelites, who would be ſtill counted the people of God, and were circumciſed, and in the worſhip of the golden calves pretended the worſhip of the true God; and ſo in ſome things lived accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:42229:274"/>
to the laws of Iſrael, and yet at the ſame time worſhiped Baal the god of the Zidonians, and are therefore charged by Elijah to halt between two opinions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the people anſwered him not a word.]</hi> This might be either from guilt of conſcience or diſtraction of mind; fearing on the one ſide the wrath of God, if they ſhould provoke him to diſpleaſure, and on the other ſide the wrath of the king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>I, even I onely remain a prophet of the Lord.]</hi> The meaning of this is, that there was not a Prophet of the Lords beſides himſelf, that did openly ſhew himſelf for the true God and his worſhip againſt their idolatry; at leaſt that there was none but he preſent there at that time.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Chooſe you one bullock for your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] That they might not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward pretend that their God refuſed to anſwer them, becauſe the God of Elijah had been preferred before him, he gives them the priviledge and advantage (if any it were) both of offering firſt, to wit, the morning ſacrifice, and of chooſing which of the bullocks they liked beſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And they took the bullock which was given them,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, which Ahab had given them, or which Elijah had given them libertie to chooſe, verſ. 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they leaped upon the altar which was made.]</hi> This may be alſo rendered as it is in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>and they leapt up and down at the altar,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that the meaning may be, either that they danced and skipped about the altar; which it ſeems they did cuſtomarily in the worſhip of Baal; as deſiring perhaps to make ſhew of ſuch propheticall extaſies, as were uſuall with thoſe that were poſſeſſed with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſpirit; or elſe, that in a kind of frantick manner they leapt upon the altar, to expreſſe thereby their vehement deſire, that Baal would heare them; as if they would have clambered up to fetch down fire from heaven, if it had been poſſible; or were ready even to ſacrifice themſelves, that they might prevail in their ſuit: ſome indeed conceive that this is ſpoken of Elijahs altar, upon which the Baalitiſh prophets leapt, as in a kind of divine fury, to throw it down; but the firſt expoſition doth farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agree with the order of the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And it came to paſſe at noon, that Elijah mocked them,</hi> &amp;c.] to wit, when the time limited for their ſacrifice was fully ended, or well nigh at an end: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this he would not do it, becauſe it might firſt be apparent by their loſt labour ſo long together, that they deſerved to be mocked, and becauſe they might not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſay, that he had interrupted them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And they cried aloud, and cut themſelves after their manner with knives,</hi> &amp;c.] As the heathens uſed to do in their ſorrows, Deut. 14.1. And the more to move their God to take compaſſion on them, and not to deny them, that were content thus to torture themſelves, and as it were to ſacrifice their own bloud upon his altar, that they might obtain what would be for his glory as well as theirs.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And they propheſied untill the time of the offering of the evening ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.]</hi> That is, they prayed and called upon Baal, and with many ſtrange geſtures (as men inſpired) ſung the praiſes of their idol-god; ſo labouring by all means to prevail with him to ſend fire to conſume their ſacrifices. See the notes, 1. Sam. 10.5. and 18.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.]</hi> Not the
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:42229:275"/>
altar whereon Baals prieſts laid their ſacrifices, which afterward they brake down, and that by leaping upon it, verſ. 26. as ſome conceive: for it is not probable that Elijah would make uſe of their altar: rather it may ſeem that Elijah brake down their altar, and having purged the place, built another in the room; or that this mount Carmel, having been one of the high places whereon they uſed to ſacrifice in former times, there was the ruins of an altar there, which the idolatrous Iſraelites had broken down; according to that complaint of Elijah, chap. 19.14. <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael have forſaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and ſlain thy prophets with the ſword:</hi> and that this the Prophet did now repair: a reall ſigne of his great deſigne, which was, to reſtore again the true worſhip of God in the land.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And Elijah took twelve ſtones, according to the number of the tribes,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the greateſt part of ten of the twelve tribes were at this time corrupted with the idolatry of Baal, yet Elijah would build his altar with <hi>twelve ſtones, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the tribes</hi> of Iſrael: Firſt, thereby to ſignifie, that it was built for the worſhip of that God, whom the patriarchs had formerly worſhiped: Secondly, to put the people in mind, that they ought all to be united in the worſhip of this God of their fathers; or elſe it would be in vain to reckon themſelves amongſt Gods Iſrael: And thirdly, to put God in mind as it were of the covenant which he had made formerly with their fathers.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>Fill foure barrels with water, and poure it on the burnt ſacrifice,</hi> &amp;c.] Mount Carmel ſtood cloſe upon the ſea; whence they might even in this drought have water enough: Now the reaſon why the Prophet appointed ſo much water to be poured upon the ſacrifice, and the wood whereon it was laid, was partly, to make it the more evident that there was no fraud uſed in hiding any fire ſecretly under the wood; and partly, that the burning of the ſacrifice with fire from heaven, might be the more wonderfull in the eyes of all that beheld it: why there were three times foure barrels of water poured upon the altar, which was twelve barrels, we may judge by that which is ſaid in the foregoing notes, concerning the twelve ſtones where of the altar was built.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>Heare me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou haſt turned their heart back again.]</hi> That is, that by thy appointment theſe things have been done, to the end their hearts might be turned from their idols to thee.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kiſhon, and ſlew them there.]</hi> That is, he cauſed the people to bring them down, and to ſlay them there: ſo wonderfully were the people affected at preſent, with ſeeing fire come down from heaven to conſume Elijahs ſacrifice, and ſuch a dread it brought upon them, of the infinite power of that God, who by this miracle did teſtifie againſt their idolatry; that without any feare of the king, they were ready to do what ever Elijah would adviſe them to: and therefore when he, apprehending the opportunity of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, appointed them to put all the prophets to death; they yielded ſtreight; and the carrying them away to the brook Kiſhon, that execution might be done upon them there, was either to teſtifie, that it was becauſe of their idolatry that the brooks and rivers were in a great part even dryed up, or that the place
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:42229:275"/>
where they had ſacrificed to the Lord, might not be defiled with their blood.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. <hi>And Elijah ſaid unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a ſound of aboundance of rain.]</hi> Becauſe he had ſpent all that day faſting, in an eager expectation of the event of this great buſineſſe, and to ſhew how acceptable a ſacrifice the ſlaying of Baals prophets was unto the Lord, he adviſeth him to eat and drink for the refreſhing of himſelf, aſſuring him, that they ſhould now have rain: and to expreſſe how certain that was which he foretold, he ſpeaks as if alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he heard the very ſound of the thunder and pouring rain that was now coming; <hi>for there is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a ſound of aboundance of rain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel,</hi> &amp;c. He went up to the top of Carmel, that there he might pray for rain, and ſtand as it were upon a watch tower, waiting and looking for the riſing of thoſe clouds, that ſhould bring thoſe glad ſhowres that he prayed for; and whereas it follows, that <hi>he caſt himſelf down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</hi> thereby is meant, that he kneeled down upon the ground, and then bowed his face down to his knees, by this humble poſture, to expreſſe his awfull reſpect to the majeſtie of that God, whoſe aid he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored; and withall, ſo to hide his eyes from all diſtracting objects, that he might the more wholly attend the work which he went about; to wit, the opening of the heavens, by praying to the Lord for rain, for though God had aſſured him there ſhould be rain, verſ. 1. <hi>I will ſend rain upon the earth,</hi> and thereupon he did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Ahab that it ſhould be ſo; yet he knew withall, that prayer muſt accompliſh that which God had promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>And ſaid to his ſervant, Go up now, look toward the ſea,</hi> &amp;c.] Elijah deſired to have notice of the firſt riſing of the clouds, that he might preſently go to the king and haſt him away, that ſo ſtill it might be the more manifeſt, that he had procured the rain from God; but becauſe he would not himſelf be taken off from his prayers, whileſt he was praying, he ſent his ſervant to obſerve the riſing of the cloud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and appointed him to <hi>look toward the ſea,</hi> becauſe thence the vapours do uſually ariſe which breed clouds and rain; and becauſe there he might have the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proſpect, to diſcover the firſt riſing of a cloud in the skie, and ſeven ſeverall times he did this, purpoſely to teach us, that we muſt not be diſcouraged, but with patience muſt be content to wait upon God, though we have not preſently that which we pray for.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 46. <hi>And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he girded up his loines, and ran before Ahab,</hi> &amp;c.] The reaſons, why Elijah did thus as a lacquey run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ahabs chariot, to the very entrance of Jezreel; may be, firſt, to manifeſt the Prophets humilitie, and how farre he was from being puffed up with that wonderfull work that he had done: Secondly, to ſhew the king how ready both God and his prophets would be to honour him, if he would proceed on to remove idolatry out of the land, the work that was now ſo happily begun by the ſlaughter made of the prophets of Baal: Thirdly, to ſignifie hereby, that it was he that brought them this rain, that did now begin to poure down from the clouds upon them: Fourthly, to avow hereby, what he had done in the ſlaughter of the Baalites; and, as it were, to triumph in the victory of their idolatrous prophets, whom he had left dead behind him: Fifthly, that being in the eye of the king all the way he returned home, this
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:42229:276"/>
might make him the more ſeriouſly to ponder in his mind, the great things the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had done; that ſo they might make the deeper impreſſion upon him: It may ſeem ſtrange indeed, that the king ſhould not take up the Prophet into his chariot; but therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>the hand of the Lord was upon Elijah, and he girded up his loines;</hi> that is, he was extraordinarily moved of God, and enabled by God, thus to run before the chariot of Ahab.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withall, how he had ſlain,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he told her the ſucceſſe of that conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Elijah and the prophets of Baal, and all the miraculous paſſages that Elijah had done; and that to clear himſelf from being blamed by that his imperious wife, for that unavoidable execution of the Baalites which followed hereupon; yet withall he would have her know, that the putting of them to the ſword, was rather Elijahs fact, then his; <hi>he had ſlain all the prophets with the ſword:</hi> as fearing, that all which could be ſaid, would hardly ſatisfie her: but that the foure hundred prophets of the groves are not included amongſt thoſe that were ſlain by Elijah, we may the rather think; becauſe, chap. 22.6. we reade again of foure hundred prophets that were called together by Ahab.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Then Jezebel ſent a meſſenger unto Elijah, ſaying, So let the gods do to me,</hi> &amp;c.] Either ſhe aſſured her ſelf, that he who had alwayes ſhewen himſelf ſo ſtout and bold, and might now be encouraged with the favour of the people, would not fly; or elſe ſhe was merely carried away with the impotencie or her rage and paſſion, which God by his all-ruling providence did now make uſe of, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Prophet; for elſe ſhe would never have ſent him word what ſhe meant to do; thereby giving him warning, as it were, to be gone. Concerning this form of ſwearing, <hi>So let the gods do to me, and more alſo,</hi> &amp;c. See the note Ruth 1.17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And when he ſaw that, he aroſe, and went for his life, and came to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſheba,</hi> &amp;c.] That he might not be exalted in mind, becauſe of thoſe great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that had been wrought by him, the Lord ſuffered him to be over-born with fears, that he might ſee his own weakneſſe, inſomuch that he who erewhile feared not Ahab and all his Baalites, did now at the threats of a woman, not onely flie into another kingdome, the kingdome of Judah, (where good Jehoſhaphat then reigned) yea to the uttermoſt parts of that kingdome, to Beerſheba, that was ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the fartheſt part of all that land, but alſo from thence withdrew himſelf <hi>into the wilderneſſe;</hi> not as ſuſpecting any evil from good Jehoſhaphat, the king of Judah; but as fearing leſt Ahab or Jezebel ſhould ſend ſome or other into Judah to diſpatch him there; and happely the rather becauſe there was too great corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence betwixt Jehoſhaphat and them; and therefore when he went from Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba, becauſe he would not expoſe him to the wants of the wilderneſſe, and becauſe being alone he might the better hide himſelf, <hi>he left his ſervant there.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And he requeſted for himſelf that he might die,</hi> &amp;c.] The miſery that at preſent he underwent, made him now as deſirous to be rid of his life, as before he was ſolicitous by flight to preſerve it; eſpecially conſidering, that dying here in
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:42229:276"/>
an ordinary way, Jezebel and her Baalites could not triumph over him: <hi>It is enough,</hi> ſaith he, that is, I have lived long enough, I know I muſt die, (<hi>for I am no better then my fathers,</hi> that have all dyed before me,) and therefore ſince my life is full of nothing but troubles and miſery I deſire to end my dayes preſently.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And he looked, and behold, there was a cake,</hi> &amp;c.] This word <hi>behold,</hi> intimates how wonderfull it was to him, he not knowing from whence it came.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Ariſe and eat, becauſe the journey is too great for thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Elijah happely had not pitched upon the place whither he meant to go, yet the Lord gives him notice that ſo farre and long he ſhould ſtill wander, that it was fit he ſhould well refreſh himſelf with that proviſion, which by his angels he had now ſent to him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And he went in the ſtrength of that meat fourty dayes and fourty nights, unto Horeb the mount of God.]</hi> So called, becauſe there the Lord appeared to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in a burning buſh, and there afterwards he gave the law to the Iſraelites. How the ſtrength of this meat could ſuſtain Elijah ſo long it is needleſſe to enquire, ſince it was done miraculouſly by the command of God; as he was pleaſed to ſuſtain Moſes as long without food, ſo he was pleaſed by the ſtrength of one meal thus to ſuſtain Elijah; thereby to ſhew, with how little he can uphold the life and ſtrength of his ſervants, if they be brought into ſtraits. However, obſervable it is, that both Chriſt, Moſes, and Elijah, who appeared together when Chriſt was transfigured, did each of them faſt in their ſeverall times fourty dayes and fourty nights without any ſuſtenance.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hoſts,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I have been zealous for thy glory and worſhip, and grieved in thy behalf to ſee thy people forſake thee, and go a whoring after ſtrange gods; yea, and I have oppoſed, what in me lay, the horrible apoſtacie of the times; and hereby I have incenſed the adverſaries againſt me, ſo that they ſeek to ſlay me, as they have done the reſt of the prophets; and this is the reaſon I am here forced to hide my ſelf: but howſoever, obſervable it is, that the prophet makes not a direct anſwer to the queſtion propounded, but chooſeth rather to imply the cauſe of his fear and flight, then plainly to confeſſe that he fled thither, (which was his fault) for fear of Jezebel.</p>

                     <hi>For the children of Iſrael have forſaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the altars in the high places, whereon the people had formerly ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the temple was built by Solomon: for though it was a ſinne to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice upon any altar, but that at the temple in Jeruſalem (and therefore thoſe kings that pulled down theſe altars, and took away theſe high places, are highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it) yet the Iſraelites not doing it for this reaſon, but onely out of their zeal for Baal, that his worſhip might be promoted, and that there might not be any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall left of the true God in the land of Iſrael, it is reckoned as a ſinne in them, and a manifeſt proof of their bitter hatred of the true religion from which they were revolted. Thus theſe words are uſually underſtood by Expoſitours: yet there
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:42229:277"/>
may be another probable ſenſe given of them, <hi>they have thrown down thine altars,</hi> that is, they have deſtroyed thy worſhip; to wit, by reſtraining men from Gods altar at Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I, even I onely am left, and they ſeek my life to take it away.]</hi> That is, there is none left but my ſelf, that do openly plead thy cauſe againſt thine enemies; all the reſt being either ſlain, or hiding themſelves, chap. 18.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And behold, the Lord paſſed by,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the glory of the Lord, wherewith he was pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf at preſent to his ſervant Elijah. Thus, in the firſt words, the generall ſumme of the whole viſion is expreſſed, and then in the following words we are told more particularly how this was done: firſt, there was <hi>a great and ſtrong wind that rent the mountains, and brake the rocks in pieces before the lord,</hi> then after that there was <hi>an earthquake,</hi> and after that a <hi>fire,</hi> but the Lord was in none of theſe; that is, the Lord did not in theſe appear to Elijah, &amp; ſpeak and make known his will to him as he did afterward (theſe were but glorious fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of Gods preſence) but then at laſt there came after the fire, a <hi>ſtill ſmall voice,</hi> and then the Lord appeared to him, and inſtructed him what he ſhould do. Now the end of this viſion or apparition, I conceive, was, firſt, to humble Elijah with thoſe terrible foregoing ſignes of Gods Maieſtie and power, that ſo he might with the more awfulneſſe, and ſear, and readineſſe to obey, hearken unto that which God ſhould ſay to him, and withall acknowledge Gods mercy in that he did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm him with his terrours and judgements, notwithſtanding his cowardiſe in withdrawing himſelf from the work of his calling; but was content to deal with him in ſuch a gentle and gracious manner, as at preſent he did. Secondly, to ſtrengthen his faith in Gods protection, by letting him ſee, that God, who had all the creatures at his command, was able, if he ſaw cauſe, to deſtroy and conſume all his enemies even in a moment. And thirdly, to inſtruct him how he was purpoſed to deal with his enemies, thereby to appeaſe the griefe and diſcontent of his ſpirit, concerning them, (and then a chief part of the ſignificancie of this apparition muſt conſiſt in this, that God was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, as is noted, verſ. 11.12.) namely that though the Lord were of infinite power to deſtroy all his wicked adverſaries, and could by divers terrible and unreſiſtable judgements puniſh Ahab and Jezebel, and other his proud perſecutours; yet he would rather ſtill deal with them (according to his wonted long ſuffering and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) by the ſtill and gentle voice of the miniſtery of his prophets: or happely, that though he could ſweep them away inſtantly with his judgements, yet rather he would effect their ruine in his good time, in a more ſecret, hidden, and tacit way: Yea and fourthly, it is not improbable which ſome alſo adde, that hereby likewiſe was ſignified, that Gods ſaving manifeſtation of himſelf is not to be expected in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the law, but in the ſtill and gracious voice of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>He wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and ſtood in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in of the cave.]</hi> The Lord did before enjoyn Elijah to come up out of the cave, and to ſtand upon the mount before him, verſ. 11. and no doubt, he went immediately up, at leaſt to the mouth of the cave (elſe could he not have ſeen the fire that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before the Lord) but yet it ſeems there he ſtayed, and kept himſelf ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till knowing that with that ſtill ſmall voyce the Lord would appear to him,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:42229:277"/>
he then went out to the very entring in of the cave, onely withall caſting his mantle about his face, which he did out of an awfull fear of Gods majeſty; as Moſes did, Exod. 3.6. concerning which, ſee the notes there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There came a voice to him, and ſaid, What doeſt thou heare, Elijah?]</hi> The very ſame queſtion that God had propounded to him before, he now propounded again; either thereby to let him know, that it was he that now ſpake again to him; or that his former reply was no ſufficient excuſe for his deſerting thoſe propheticall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which God had called him; or elſe, that Elijah returning the ſame anſwer that he had formerly given him, the Lord might thence take occaſion to give him that further ſatisfaction concerning his fears, and directions what he ſhould do, which now he intended him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Anoint Hazael to be king over Syria,</hi> &amp;c.] We reade that Eliſha foretold Hazael that he ſhould be king of Syria, 2. Kings 8.13. and that a young Prophet by Eliſhaes directions, did long after this anoint Jehu king of Iſrael, 2. Kings 9.1, 6. and here in the following words is expreſſed, that Eliſha was called to be a Prophet, by the caſting of Elijahs mantle upon him, verſ. 19, 20, 21. but that Hazael or Eliſha were ever anointed, we reade not; nor that Jehu was anointed by Elijah, and hence the moſt Interpreters do hold, that by anointing, here is meant onely the deſigning of them to their offices, and that this Elijah did to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael and Jehu, by appointing Eliſha to do it when he was gone, and to Eliſha by caſting his mantle upon him, whereupon he had preſently the gift of propheſie, that unction of Gods ſpirit, whereof the outward anointing was a ſigne. But rather I think, we may ſay, that Elijah did what now he was enjoyned, that is, that he did indeed anoint Hazael, Jehu, an Eliſha, though it be not expreſſed; and indeed to what end was Elijah now preſently to go to Damaſcus if it were not to anoint Hazael?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Him that eſcapeth the ſword of Hazael, ſhall Jehu ſlay.]</hi> Though Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſuffered moſt of Hazaels crueltie in the latter dayes of Jehu, 2. Kings 10.32. <hi>In thoſe dayes the Lord began to cut Iſrael ſhort, and Hazael ſmote them in all the coaſts of Iſrael;</hi> and in the dayes of Jehoahaz his ſonne, 2. Kings 13.1, 3. yet in the dayes of Joram the ſonne of Ahab (before Jehu) did Hazael begin to afflict Iſrael, as is evident by the battel which Joram fought with Hazael, 2. Kings 8.28. Now with reſpect to this it is ſaid here, that <hi>him that eſcapeth Hazaels ſword, ſhall Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu ſlay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And him that eſcapeth from the ſword of Jehu, ſhall Eliſha ſlay.]</hi> That is (ſay the moſt Expoſitours) by threatning them, and adjudging them by a propheticall ſpirit to thoſe calamities, and to that deſtruction which afterward fell upon them; and indeed we find the like expreſſions, which upon this ground the Lord elſewhere uſeth concerning his Prophets, as Jer. 1.10. <hi>See I have this day ſet thee over the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and over the kingdomes, to root out, and to pull down, and to deſtroy, and to throw down, to build and to plant:</hi> and Hoſ. 6.5. <hi>Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets, I have ſlain them by the words of my mouth.</hi> Some Expoſitours adde further, that theſe words are particularly intended concerning thoſe children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th-el, that were torn by two ſhe beares immediately upon Eliſhaes curſing them in the name of the Lord, 2. Kings 2.24. and concerning thoſe that died of the famine
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:42229:278"/>
that was in Samaria, which it ſeems indeed Eliſha had beforehand threatened ſhould come upon them, becauſe the king was ſo enraged againſt the Prophet for it, <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do ſo, and more alſo to me, if the head of Eliſha the ſonne of Shaphat ſhall ſtand on him this day:</hi> But becauſe theſe things were done before the dayes of Jehu, and theſe words ſeem plainly to ſpeak of ſomething to be done after Jehu had begun to execute Gods wrath upon them, <hi>him that eſcapeth from the ſword of Jehu ſhall Eliſha ſlay;</hi> I rather think that this is meant of ſome other judgements (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſtory) which upon the prophecying or prayers of Eliſha did after that fall upon the idolatrous Iſraelites; yea perhaps the people might be wonne by Eliſha to do ſome execution upon the Baalites, as they were formerly by Elijah, 1. Kings 18.40.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Yet have I left me ſeven thouſand in Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that have not worſhiped Baal, and this is added to comfort Elijah concerning that complaint of his, <hi>I, even I onely am left,</hi> verſ. 14. becauſe they uſed not onely to bow and kneel before their idols, but alſo to kiſſe them, according to that Hoſ. 13.2. <hi>Let the men that ſacrifice kiſſe the calves;</hi> or if they could not come ſo near their idol-gods, then to kiſſe their hands as they bowed before them (whence is that of Job chap. 31.26, 27. <hi>If I beheld the ſunne when it ſhined, or the moon walking in brightneſſe, and my heart hath been ſecretly inticed, or my mouth hath kiſſed my hand</hi>) therefore to imply men that had not in the leaſt kind polluted themſelves with the idolatry of Baal, the Lord uſeth this expreſſion here; <hi>all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kiſſed him:</hi> and by this, as by a book-caſe, doth the Apoſtle Paul prove that God had not caſt off all the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in his time, Rom. 11.2, 3, 4:</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And found Eliſha the ſonne of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth.]</hi> That is, he had twelve plowes going in the field with twelve yoke of oxen, and the reſt having ſeverall ſervants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them, and holding them, he himſelf was with the twelfth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Elijah paſſed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.]</hi> The prophets wore a rough mantle peculiar to them, whereby they were known; 2. Kings 1.8. <hi>And they anſwered him: He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins, and he ſaid, it is Elijah the Tiſhbite:</hi> Zach. 13.4. <hi>The prophets ſhall be aſhamed, every one of his viſion when he hath propheſied, neither ſhall they wear a rough garment to deceive:</hi> ſo that by the throwing of his mantle upon him was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that God had called him to the office, and would give him the gifts and ſpirit of a Prophet, and that he ſhould ſucceed him in his room; yea, and afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he did alſo anoint him, as Gods command above verſ. 16. ſeems to imply.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, Go back again, for what have I done to thee?]</hi> This Elijah ſpake to imply, that it muſt needs be from a ſupernaturall work of Gods Spirit upon him, and not from his throwing of his mantle upon him, that Eliſha ſhould thus tender himſelf to abandon all and to follow him; and that therefore he had need to be carefull that he did not neglect the call of God; and thus though he gave him liberty to return back to take his leave of his father and mother, yet withall he gives him a caveat to take heed of making any delay in doing what God had moved him to do; he might go whither he liſt for any thing that he had done to him,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:42229:278"/>
but God had made ſuch an impreſſion upon his ſpirit, that he could not without perill withſtand, or diſregard, this powerfull and commanding motion of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and ſlew them, and boiled their fleſh with the inſtruments,</hi> &amp;c.] To make therewith a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well feaſt for his friends, and to expreſſe thereby his joy (worthy a feaſt) and his bidding adue to his former imployments.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his hoſt together,</hi> &amp;c.] Some thirty years before this, Aſa had called in Ben-hadad, the father of this Ben-hadad, verſ. 34. to his aid againſt Baaſha king of Iſrael, chap. 15.17, 18, &amp;c. at which time Ben-hadad took ſome of the Iſraelites towns, and ſuch ſweetneſſe it ſeems he had found in the ſoil of Iſrael, that now he came again unſent for, and nothing now would ſerve him but Samaria it ſelf; and thus withall too God puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the idolatry, and other groſſe ſinnes that were amongſt the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And he ſent meſſengers to Ahab king of Iſrael into the citie,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, upon a parley deſired on one ſide, Ben-hadad, by his meſſengers ſent into the citie, made known what he required ere he would raiſe the ſiege of Samaria; namely, that Ahab ſhould yield up all he had to him, <hi>thy ſilver and thy gold is mine, thy wives alſo and thy children are mine:</hi> inſolent conditions; and ſuch as manifeſted that Ben-hadad, in the confidence of his own ſtrength, did exceedingly deſpiſe the king of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the king of Iſrael anſwered and ſaid, My Lord O king,</hi> &amp;c.] Two ſeverall grounds of Ahabs yielding thus to Ben-hadads motion, are conceived by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours: the one is, that Ahab thought Ben-hadad had deſired onely that he ſhould deliver up the wealth of his own palace, and his own wives and children, and not the pillage of the whole citie, and that this, out of a deſire to ſave his ſubjects from dammage, he was content to yield to: the other is, that Ahab underſtood the meſſage of Ben-hadad, as if he had onely required the ſoveraignty over all that they had; namely, that both he and his people ſhould acknowledge themſelves his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and ſo by the payment of a yearly tribute, ſhould teſtifie that they held all they had, of him; and that this to ridde himſelf of the ſiege, he yielded to; <hi>according to thy ſaying, I am thine, and all that I have:</hi> ſo granting him the dominion with reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own ſubordinate intereſt; and this laſt expoſition I conceive is the beſt, becauſe it ſeems not probable, that he ſhould ſo readily yield to deliver up his wives and his children, into the hands of a heathen king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Although I have ſent unto thee, ſaying, Thou ſhalt deliver me thy ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe were the ſecond conditions which Ben-hadad ſent to Ahab; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears, that either Ahab miſtook his former motion, and ſo this was now ſent to explain that; or elſe, that Ben-hadad being puffed up with Ahabs ſubmiſſive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, did now propound harder conditions then he did before; and (according to that which is before noted upon the foregoing verſe) two ſeverall wayes this may be underſtood; namely, that either whereas before it was thought he required onely the kings wives and children, ſilver, and gold; now he required libertie to take in the

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty whatſoever he pleaſed: or elſe, that whereas before it was thought he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired onely that they ſhould acknowledge his ſoveraignty, and hold all that they had of him as his vaſſals and tributaries; now he demanded, that they ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely yield up the pillage of the city to his ſouldiers and ſervants; ſuffering them to enter the citie, and take from thence whatſoever they pleaſed: <hi>Although,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have ſent unto thee, ſaying, Thou ſhalt deliver me thy ſilver and thy gold,</hi> &amp;c. That is, though I have ſent unto thee challenging that thy riches, thy wives, and thy children were mine; yet it was no part of my meaning, that thou ſhouldeſt onely acknowledge the dominion of them to belong to me, and ſhouldeſt ſtill hold them in thine own poſſeſſion; no, I require that they be out of hand delivered to me; nor will I be ſatisfied with words, or a bare title, <hi>to morrow about this time, I will ſend my ſervants;</hi> who ſhall not out of thy houſe onely, but alſo out of thy ſervants houſes, take what they pleaſe; and onely upon this condition will I raiſe the ſeige.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Mark I pray you, and ſee how this man ſeeketh miſchief.]</hi> That is, by this ſecond meſſage he hath ſent, if you well obſerve it, you may plainly ſee, that though he pretends a treaty, and would ſeem upon conditions willing to raiſe this ſiege; yet in truth he intends nothing but miſchief and ruine to us, or elſe he would never propound ſuch conditions to us: either we muſt yield up the whole citie to be pillaged by his ſouldiers, and our ſelves our wives and children to be their ſlaves, or elſe nothing will content him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Tell my lord the king, All that thou didſt ſend for to thy ſervant at the firſt, I will do; but this thing I may not do.]</hi> Thus, though Ahab refuſed to ſubmit to what Benhadad had the ſecond time required of him, yet his denyall came from him ſo poorely, that it plainly diſcovered how fearfull he was and loth to provoke Benhadad. For firſt, he ſtill cals Benhadad his lord, and himſelf his ſervant: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whileſt he denyes the ſecond motion, he is carefull to let him know, that he was ſtill willing to yield to the firſt: And thirdly, it was not, <hi>This thing I will not do,</hi> but, <hi>this thing I may not do:</hi> It was eaſie to diſcern, that it was the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory indignation of the people that had made him reject the propoſitions of Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad, rather then any courage that was in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>The gods do ſo unto me and more alſo, if the duſt of Samaria ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for handfuls,</hi> &amp;c.] In a bragging manner he threatens the utter ruinating of their city: and withall (to terrifie Ahab and the people the more) vaunts, that ſuch was the multitude of his ſouldiers, that the duſt of Samaria ſhould not ſuffice for handfuls for them: ſo ſpeaking of Samaria, notwithſtanding the ſtrength of her walls and bulwarks, as if it were but a heap of duſt, which ſhould be levelled to the ground, with as much eaſe, as if every ſouldier were to carry away but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: or rather, after an hyperbolicall manner, menacing them, that they would make nothing to carry away the very ground whereon the city ſtood, or at leaſt, the bulwarks of the city, though each of his followers took but a handfull: the like expreſſion we ſee, 2 Sam. 17.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>He ſaid unto his ſervants, Set your ſelves in array,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be tranſlated alſo, as it is in the margin of our bibles, <hi>place the engines;</hi> to wit, for the battering of the city: it ſeems that during the parly, or treaty, there was a ceſſation
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:42229:279"/>
of arms on both ſides; and therefore when Benhadad ſaw that Ahab would not yield to what he had propounded, he commanded his captains again to prepare for an aſſault upon the citie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And behold there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] God foretels what he means to do by a prophet, that the victory might not be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to chance; and withall, to diſcover the exceeding riches of his grace, in afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much mercy to this vile wretch, even by one of thoſe prophets whom he ſought to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Even by the young men, of the princes of the provinces.]</hi> That is, not by thy experienced captains, or old trained ſouldiers, ſhalt thou prevail over the Syrians: but by the young men, that wait and attend upon the princes of the provinces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then he ſaid, Who ſhall order the battel?]</hi> This queſtion propounded by Ahab to the prophet, may be underſtood two ſeverall wayes: to wit, either that he required who ſhould go out with his forces, as Commander in chief, to order the battell as he ſhould ſee cauſe; or elſe, that he deſired to know, whether he ſhould ſtay till the king of Syria came out and ſet themſelves in battell array againſt them, or whether he ſhould go out firſt, and ſet the battell in array againſt the Syrians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he anſwered, Thou.]</hi> That is, Ahab himſelf; to wit, that the young men might the more readily undertake the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Then he numbred the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two,</hi> &amp;c.] And theſe, it ſeems, were to be captains and leaders to the ſeven thouſand afterwards mentioned; and, or elſe rather, theſe were to go before as a forlorn hope, to ſet firſt on the enemy, and then the body of the army was to follow, and ſecond them; and ſo much indeed the following words, verſ. 17. ſeem to imply, <hi>And the young men of the princes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces went out firſt,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for warre, take them alive.]</hi> That is, though they ſhould now come out to ſue for conditions of peace, yet take them priſoners, and bring them to me, which was againſt the law of arms; as thinking ſcorn to fight with them, he commands his men to take them alive: and as preſumptuouſly puft up with his great ſtrength, he thinks enough to ſay, <hi>Take them alive;</hi> as if the Iſraelites had not courage enough to lift up a hand againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Go ſtrengthen thy ſelf, and mark, and ſee what thou doest.]</hi> That is, take heed, that through ſecurity, or any other way, thou doeſt not give any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to theſe Syrians, when they ſhall again invade the land the next yeare: and herein doubtleſſe the prophet did intend to imply, not onely that he ſhould prepare all outward means for the withſtanding of the Syrians; but alſo that he ſhould be carefull by faith, and repentance, and prayer, to make his peace with God, leſt God ſhould be provoked at laſt to deliver him up into the hands of his enemies; and if this were the ſame prophet that foretold the former victory, (as the vvords ſeem here to import, <hi>And the prophet came to the king of Iſrael</hi>) the king had the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon now to give credit to what he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Their gods are gods of the hils, therefore they were ſtronger then we.]</hi>

This ſpeech of the ſervants of the king of Syria, was grounded on that ſottiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the heathen, that their gods bare rule ſome in one place and ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and becauſe the former battell was fought in a hilly countrey, therefore they concluded, that the gods of the Iſraelites were gods of the hils: the rather alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to this conceit (ſay ſome Expoſitours) partly, becauſe the land of Iſrael was in a great part of it full of mountains and hils; and partly, becauſe they had heard, that the Iſraelites uſed conſtantly to offer up their ſacrifices in hils and high places. But however, obſervable it is; how herein alſo they flattered both their king, and themſelves too; there is not a word ſpoken of their own cowardiſe, or the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality and ſecurity of their king, who was drinking himſelf drunk, when the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites came upon them; but all their loſſe is aſcribed to this, that their gods were gods of the valleys; and the gods of the Iſraelites, gods of the hils.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms.]</hi> This they adde as implying, that their former loſſe might be by their means, rather then the cowardiſe of his own people; to wit, by their unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or want of skill in martiall affairs; or by their delicacy, and the evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample they had given, in being feaſting and drinking, when they ſhould have been preparing for the battell.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Ben-hadad numbred the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight againſt Iſrael.]</hi> Which was in the tribe of Aſher, Joſh. 19.30, 31. and here Ben-hadad now choſe to fight with Iſrael, not onely becauſe it was a plain countrey, verſ. 23. <hi>Let us fight against them in the plain, and ſurely we ſhall be ſtronger then they:</hi> but alſo, becauſe this was one of thoſe cities which his father had formerly taken from the Iſraelites, verſ. 34. and ſo hither they might retire to ſhelter themſelves, if the battell ſhould go againſt them; as we ſee they did, verſ. 30. <hi>But the rest fled to Aphek into the citie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And the children of Iſrael pitched before them, like two little flocks of kids.]</hi> hereby it appears, that the Iſraelites had divided their forces into two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and were but weakly provided for warre in compariſon of the Syrians.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Becauſe the Syrians have ſaid, The Lord is God of the hils, but he is not God of the valleys,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you deſerve not the leaſt help from heaven, becauſe of your wickedneſſe, and the little good done amongſt you, by the former victory I gave you; yet to confute this blaſphemy of the Syrians, even in the valleys I will again deliver all this great multitude into thine hand.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And there was a wall fell upon twenty and five thouſand of the men that were left.]</hi> Either by ſome warlike ſtratagem of the Iſraelites when they were battering the walls of the city; or, rather by ſome earthquake, or other immediate hand of God, overturning the walls upon them, perhaps when they were buſied to raiſe them higher, or to make them ſtronger, that under the covert thereof they might the better ſhelter themſelves againſt the Iſraelites, or whileſt they were ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding behind the wall to defend the city againſt the Iſraelites that ſought to ſtorm it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>We have heard that the kings of the houſe of Iſrael are mercifull kings.]</hi> It ſeems their mercifull dealing with thoſe they overcame in battell, had got the kings of Iſrael this report amongſt other nations.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>So he made a covenant with him, and ſent him away.]</hi> Thus ſleightly did Ahab paſſe over the great dammage the people of God had undergone, by his invading the land of Iſrael two yeares together, and that horrible blaſphemy of him and his Syrians; in ſaying, that the Lord was God in the hils, and not in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys: but in the mean ſeaſon, he that was thus ready to pity Ben-hadad, could perſecute the poore prophets of God, and not ſhew them the leaſt mercy at all.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And a certain man of the ſonnes of the prophets, ſaid unto his neighbour in the word of the Lord, Smite me, I pray thee.]</hi> That is, one of thoſe young prophets that were trained up in the Schools or Colledges of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, under their aged fathers; did in the name of the Lord, require one of his fellow prophets to ſmite him; to wit, with a ſword, ſo as to wound him; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, verſ. 37. and this he required; Firſt, that being wounded he might the better reſemble a ſouldier that had been in the battell, to whoſe cuſtodie a priſoner was committed, verſe 39. And ſecondly, that being wounded and bloudy he might the better in that his condition ſhew Ahab what he was to expect from the revenging hand of God; to wit, that the Lord ſhould ſmite him, and that his bloud, and life too, ſhould be required for ſparing Ben-hadad: for thus it was uſuall with the prophets, to foreſhew in themſelves a ſhadow of that calamity which they foretold ſhould come upon others, Eſay 20.2, 3, 4, Jerem. 27.2. and Acts 21.10, 11. ſee alſo Ezek. 12.3.12.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt not obeyed the voyce of the Lord, behold, aſſoon as thou art departed from me, a lion ſhall ſlay thee.]</hi> It is moſt probable, that this his neighbour that refuſed to ſtrike him, was one of his fellow-prophets, and ſo was conſcious to himſelf, that what the Prophet required, was indeed of God, and yet preferred his own reaſon before Gods command, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for his diſobedience ſlain by a lion. However herein the Lord, as in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, diſcovered the juſtice of his puniſhing Ahab, who under a ſhew, and pretence of clemencie ſpared Ben-hadad, whom God had appointed to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction.]</hi> Happely Ahab had been expreſſely charged not to ſpare Benhadad, but however the Prophet had expreſſely told him, verſ. 28. that becauſe he and his Syrians had blaſphemed the Lord, ſaying, The Lord is God of the hils, but not of the valleys; therefore the Lord would deliver them into his hands: neither could he therefore ſpare that blaſphemous wretch without contempt of Gods known will, who had delivered him, as it were, into his power, that he might by him be ſlain for his blaſphemy.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>THe Lord forbid it me, that I ſhould give the inheritance of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto thee.]</hi> Thus he rejected Ahabs motion with deteſtation; to wit, becauſe the Lord had forbidden in his law the perpetuall ſale of any mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, Levit. 25.23. <hi>The land ſhall not be ſold for ever:</hi> and though therefore ſuch a motion made by a prince in another kingdome could not have been rejected by any ſubject, without groſſe diſregard of that Majeſtie which God hath put upon princes; yet Naboth was bound in conſcience to do it, and no doubt (though it be not here expreſſed) as he refuſed to ſatisfie the deſire of his Soveraigne herein, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he humbly preſented him with the reaſons why he durſt not do it; and made it appear, that it was not ſo much the parting with his vineyard, as his ſinning againſt God in parting with it, that he ſtumbled at; whereby it appears alſo, that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both was a pious man, and zealous of obſerving Gods law, even in theſe idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous times, which made his bloud cry the louder for vengeance againſt Ahab and Jezebel.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face.</hi> &amp;c:] As one that was diſcontented, and therefore would have no body to ſpeak to him, that cared not to ſee any body, nor to have any body ſee him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.]</hi> This is ſpoken in a vaunting way; and it may have reference either to Naboths refuſing to give Ahab his vineyard; as if ſhe had ſaid, Though he will not give thee his vineyard, I will; thou ſhalt not need to purchaſe it, nor to ſtand to his curteſie, whether he will yield it up to thee or no, I will give it thee; or elſe; to thoſe foregoing words of Jezebel, <hi>Doest thou now govern the kingdome of Iſrael;</hi> as if ſhe had ſaid, One would think a king ſhould not whine for a ſubjects deniall of ſuch a thing, having ſo much power to ſatisfie himſelf; but ſince thou knoweſt not how to improve thy power, I that am but a woman will do it for thee, I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>So ſhe wrote letters in Ahab's name,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Ahab not knowing, nor caring to know, what courſe ſhe took for the accompliſhing of that promiſe ſhe had made of getting Naboths vineyard for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="539" facs="tcp:42229:281"/>Verſ. 9. <hi>Proclaim a faſt, and ſet Naboth on high among the people.]</hi> Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this thus, that Naboth ſhould be ſet, as in regard of his dignity he uſed to be, in ſome eminent place amongſt the chief men of the city, as if there had been no evil at all plotted againſt him; and then on a ſudden the witneſſes ſhould out, and accuſe him of blaſpheming God and the king. But I rather think, that malefactours when they came to be tried before the Magiſtrate were uſually ſet upon ſome ſcaffold where they might be in the ſight of the people, and thence it was that Jezebel wrote in her letters, <hi>And ſet Naboth on high amongst the people.</hi> As for the faſt to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that was enjoyned to make a ſhew, as if indeed ſuch a horrible wickedneſſe had been committed by Naboth, as might bring Gods wrath upon all the nation, and for the diverting whereof, therefore it was fit the people ſhould in a ſolemn manner humble themſelves, and cry unto God for mercy.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And then carry him out, and ſtone him, that he may die.]</hi> For ſo the Law of God had appointed him to be puniſhed that ſhould blaſpheme the name of the Lord, Levit. 24.15, 16. <hi>Whoſoever curſeth his God ſhall bear his ſinne, and he that blaſphemeth the name of the Lord, he ſhall ſurely be put to death:</hi> and him alſo that ſhould curſe his father, Exod. 21.17. <hi>And he that curſeth his father or his mother ſhall ſurely be put to death:</hi> the Prince therefore being the father of the people <hi>(pater patriae)</hi> it ſeems the curſing of him (which is alſo a ſinne forbidden by the Law, Exod. 22.28, <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the gods, nor curſe the ruler of thy people</hi>) was uſually likewiſe puniſhed after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>The Elders, and the Nobles, who were the inhabitants in his citie. did as Jezebel had ſent unto them,</hi> &amp;c.] It may well ſeem ſtrange that the letters of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, enjoyning ſuch a groſſe and horrible act of injuſtice, ſhould without any ſcruple be ſo readily obeyed by the Elders and Nobles of Jezreel: but for this we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Firſt, that Iſrael was now become idolatrous, and in all other reſpects exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly corrupt; &amp; it is no wonder that a people that have changed their Religion at the will of a ſupreme Magiſtrate, ſhould do any thing elſe that he will command them: Secondly, that the imperious ſeveritie and crueltie of Jezebel had doubtleſſe brought this people into a miſerable bondage and thraldome: Thirdly, that Naboth being a man ſtrictly conſcionable, amongſt a lawleſſe degenerate people, it is likely they were glad of an opportunitie to wreak their teen upon him: Fourthly, that Jezebel might inform them that Naboth had done this, ſhe charged him with ſome private diſcourſe betwixt the king and him, onely the king had no witneſſes of his perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory and blaſphemous ſpeeches, and ſo that ſhe deſired was onely this, that ſome witneſſes might be found, that (upon the credit of the kings word) would charge him with this, which could not otherwiſe be legally proved, and that thereupon he might be condemned for blaſphemy, and put to death.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Then they carried him forth out of the citie, and ſtoned him with ſtones, that he dyed.]</hi> And with him his ſonnes were alſo put to death, (as it ſeems, 2. Kings 9.26. <hi>Surely I have ſeen yeſterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his ſonnes, ſaid the Lord, and I will requite thee,</hi> &amp;c.) which was directly againſt the law of God, Deut. 24.16. <hi>The fathers ſhall not be put to death for the children, nor the children for the fathers:</hi> their aim herein was doubtleſſe, that Ahab might without oppoſition enjoy Naboths vineyard: But with what pretence of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:42229:282"/>
they did it, it is uncertain; perhaps as ſome think they might alledge, that in puniſhing ſo execrable a wickedneſſe, Gods ſeverity againſt Achan was a preſident fit to be followed, whoſe ſonnes and daughters were ſtoned together with him, Joſh. 7.24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Then they ſent to Jezebel,</hi> &amp;c.] To ſhew how ready they had been to do what ſhe had enjoyned; for though the letters they had received were written to them in the kings name, yet they knew well enough, that the affairs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were chiefly ſwayed by her, and that ſhe did all, and carried all in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſhe pleaſed, and therefore their care was chiefly to ingratiate themſelves with her.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Ariſe, go down to meet Ahab king of Iſrael, which is in Samaria,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, who reignes in Samaria (for in the next words it is ſaid, that he was now in Naboths vineyard, which was in Jezreel, verſ. 1.) or ſecondly, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was at preſent in Naboths vineyard, when God ſpake to Elijah, yet he might be appointed to meet him in Samaria, becauſe he was preſently to return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or rather thirdly, this clauſe <hi>which is in Samaria,</hi> hath reference to the word, Iſrael; becauſe the ſubjects of the kings of Judah were alſo Iſraelites; therefore by way of diſtinction, Ahab is called king of <hi>Iſrael which is in Samaria,</hi> that is, in the kingdome of Samaria.</p>

Chron. 18.1. and 21.6. and hereupon it was that Jehoſhaphat went down to viſit Ahab; who with great coſt and ſtate entertained and feaſted both him and his followers, 2. Chron. 18.2. <hi>Ahab killed ſheep and oxen in abundance for Jehoſhapat, and for the people that were with him.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. (<hi>And the king of Iſrael ſaid unto his ſervants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours?</hi> &amp;c.] One article in the league, which three years ſince Ahab had made with Ben-hadad was, that he ſhould reſtore all the cities of Iſrael which were in his poſſeſſion, chap. 20.34. <hi>And Ben-hadad ſaid unto him, The cities which my father took from thy father, I will reſtore.</hi> But Ramoth Gilead, it ſeems, he was loth to part with, and therefore now Ahab enters into conſultation to recover it by forte, ſince he would not by fair means yield it up to him. It was a goodly citie, and beſides it belonged to the Levites, and was a citie of refuge, Joſh. 21.38. and therefore no wonder though he were unwilling that it ſhould be any longer in the hands of the Syrians.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Then the king of Iſrael gathered the prophets together about foure hundred men,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, his Baalitiſh falſe prophets, who were the great ſupporters of that linſey woolſey religion, that was now in faſhion amongſt the Iſraelites, pretending themſelves the prophets of the Lord Jehovah, the God of Iſrael, and yet withall the prieſts of Baal: as by the number we may gueſſe, perhaps they were thoſe foure hundred prophets of the groves, which were reſerved from appearing to Elijahs cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, chap. 18.19, 20. however they were doubtleſſe of Baals falſe prophets; for ſuch Jehoſhaphat knew them to be, and therefore could not reſt in their predictions, verſ. 7. and <hi>Jehoſhaphat ſaid, is there not here a prophet of the Lord beſides, that we might enquire of him.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And Jehoſhaphat ſaid, Let not the king ſay ſo.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, we muſt not ſay, we hate the prophets of the Lord, becauſe they ſpeak that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us not; if he be a faithfull prophet of the Lords, he muſt ſpeak the truth what ever it be; and God forbid the king ſhould ſay, that for that he hates him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Zedekiah the ſonne of Chenaaenah made him horns of Iron,</hi> &amp;c.] whereby was ſignified the power of theſe two kings that were now to go againſt the Syrians for the recovery of Ramoth Gilead.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them,</hi> &amp;c.] This the meſſenger that came for Micaiah might ſay: firſt, out of a kind of carnall cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, as wiſhing well to the prophet: and ſecondly, out of ſome ſpeciall deſire he had that the warre ſhould go forward.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he anſwered him, Go, and proſper;</hi> &amp;c.] This Micaiah ſpake ironically, not to deceive Ahab, (for we ſee, he ſpake theſe words after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Ahab himſelf perceived he meant not what he ſaid) but by way of deriding the falſe prophets, who had all returned this pleaſing anſwer to Ahab, and to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that he knew well enough that the king would not be pleaſed unleſſe he ſaid the ſame that they did; and therefore Micaiah ſaid not, Thus ſaith the Lord, Go, and proſper, &amp;c. but in a tone of deriſion, <hi>Go and proſper, for the Lord ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it into the hand of the king;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, you had beſt go as your prophets adviſe you, they all tell you, that your expedition againſt Ramoth Gilead ſhall be proſperous, and that the Lord ſhall deliver it into your hands, and can you queſtion the truth of ſuch oracles?

                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And he ſaid, I ſaw all Iſrael ſcattered upon the hills as ſheep that have not a ſhepherd.</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby was intimated, that Ahab ſhould be ſlain, and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my routed; this expreſſion of being <hi>ſcattered upon the hills,</hi> is uſed, becauſe in that countrey, when they ſought to eſcape the enemy that purſued them, they uſed to fly to the hills and mountains, there to hide themſelves; whence is that, Matth. 24.16. <hi>Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains.</hi>

And indeed happely hereby it was that Jehoſhaphat was deceived, and ſo went with Ahab, though Micaiah had foretold the death of Ahab, and diſperſion of his army.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And he ſaid, Heare thou therefore the word of the Lord.]</hi> This word <hi>therefore</hi> hath relation to that which Ahab ſaid to Jehoſhaphat: <hi>Did I not tell thee, that he would prophecie no good concerning me, but evil,</hi> as if the Prophet had ſaid; ſeeing thou art diſpleaſed at what I have ſaid, and wilt not believe, but that I have ſpoken it out of ill will, I will now largely ſhew you the whole viſion that I ſaw.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And one ſaid on this manner, and another ſaid on that manner.]</hi> This is added onely to imply, that God hath divers wayes and means whereby he can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that which he hath purpoſed in himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governour of the city, and to Joaſh the kings ſonne.]</hi> This Joaſh was, it ſeems, either the ſonne of Ahab, or rather the ſonne of Omri the father of Ahab, and called uſually amongſt the people <hi>the kings ſonne,</hi> and being in ſome place of authority in the citie, the Prophet was ſent to him, together with Amon <hi>the governour of the citie.</hi> As for theſe words of Ahabs, <hi>Take Micaiah and carry him back;</hi> from hence it may be probably gathered, that when at firſt they fetched Michaiah, they fetched him out of priſon, whither he is now ſent back again; and becauſe of this many Expoſitours incline to think, that this Micaiah was that Prophet that formerly threatned, that his life ſhould go for the life of Ben-hadad, whom he had ſent away in peace, chap. 20.42. and that for this he had been ever ſince kept in priſon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Put this fellow in priſon, and feed him with bread of affliction.</hi> &amp;c.] That is, with a diet courſe and ſcanty, a poore pittance, enough to hold life and ſoul together, ſuch as is uſually allowed to poore captives and ſlaves, and will onely ſerve to prolong their affliction and miſery. See Deut. 16.3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>So the king of Iſrael and Jehoſhaphat the king of Judah went up to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead.]</hi> It was much that good Jehoſhaphat ſhould cauſe Micaiah to be ſent for, and then ſuffer a proud Baalitiſh prieſt to ſmite him on the cheek before his face, and heare the king with ſuch a ſevere charge ſend him back to priſon, and never open his mouth to ſpeak a word for the poore Prophet: but that he ſhould go up to Ramoth Gilead with Ahab, after the Prophet had foretold the dangerous event of
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:42229:284"/>
this expedition is farre more ſtrange, and indeed all that can be ſaid herein is this, that either he was ſo farre overborn with the confidence of thoſe foure hundred Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that promiſed victory, that he began to think (however at firſt he ſuſpected them) that their words might prove true rather then Micaiahs, the rather, becauſe he knew that they ſhould fight in a juſt cauſe, which God uſually favours; or elſe, that having engaged his word already to Ahab, with whom he had lately joyned himſelf in affinitie, he was loth to ſhrink now upon the words of Micaiah, but choſe rather to hazard the ſucceſſe, and to make triall what the event would be.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And the king of Iſrael ſaid unto Jehoſhaphat, I will diſguiſe my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] Great perſonages are uſually moſt laid at in battels; and beſides, the propheſie of Micaiah had ſcared Ahab doubtleſſe, though he ſeemed to ſlight it; yea perhaps he might alſo heare of the king of Syrias charge to his ſouldiers concerning him; to avoid therefore this danger, and ſo if it might be, to elude Micaiahs threat, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to diſguiſe himſelf, and to enter the battel in the habit of an ordinary captain. But yet happely Ahab pretended that he did this, onely that the Syrians might not know there were two kings in the battel, leſt they ſhould thereby be rendred the more cautelous and wary in their fight. And thus he might indeed upon a fair ground wiſh Jehoſhaphat to go on in his robes, becauſe he would not put upon him the diſguiſing of himſelf in the attire of a common ſouldier or captain.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Fight neither with ſmall nor great, ſave onely againſt the king of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.]</hi> This the king of Syria commanded his two and thirty captains, 1. Kings 22.31. firſt, becauſe he might well hope that the death or taking of the king would be the readieſt means to rout the whole army; or ſecondly, becauſe he deſired to wipe off the diſhonour that fell upon him in the laſt battel, by bringing Ahab under his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as he was then expoſed to the mercy of Ahab. So well doth he repay the mercie which the king of Iſrael had then ſhown him, and that no doubt by the ſpeciall hand of Gods providence, to convince him of his folly in ſparing him, whom God would have had deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>Jehoſhaphat cried out.]</hi> That is, he cried out for help, to wit, both by calling upon Ahab to help him (whereby it may be the Syrian captains perceived that he was not the king of Iſrael) and by calling upon God for ſuccour, who thereupon helped him (as it is ſaid, 2. Chron. 18.31.) and moved the Syrians to depart from him; onely, the Lord was pleaſed by bringing him into this danger, to let him ſee his folly in going out with Ahab, notwithſtanding the Prophet Micaiah had given him ſo fair a warning.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>Turn thine hand, and carrie me out of the hoſt, for I am wounded.]</hi> That is, out of the battel; for he left not the camp, leſt his ſouldiers ſhould fly, but was ſtayed up in his chariot untill the evening, verſ. 35. and thus at laſt the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God fell upon him for his idolatry, and for his perſecuting Gods prophets, but eſpecially for the death of Naboth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>And one waſhed the chariot in the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his bloud,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, chap. 21.19, 41.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>Jehoſhaphat was thirty and five yeares old when he began to reigne, and he reigned twenty and five yeares in Jeruſalem.]</hi> Seeing therefore he began his reigne in the fourth yeare of Ahab, as it is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, who reigned
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:42229:285"/>
two and twenty years in Samaria, it muſt needs follow, that whileſt Jehoſhaphat ſate in the throne of Judah Ahab reigned in Iſrael about ſeventeen or eighteen years; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziah the ſonne of Joram two years, and Jehoram his brother, the ſecond ſonne of Ahab about foure years, and then Jehoſhaphat dyed, and Jehoram his ſonne reigned in his ſtead: indeed ſome Expoſitours hold, that Jehoſhaphat was deſigned and made king by his father Aſa ten yeares, or thereabouts, before his father dyed, and that of this it muſt be underſtood which is ſaid here, that he was <hi>thirty and five yeares old when he began to reigne;</hi> namely, when he was deſigned king in his fathers life time, and conſequently, that he was five and fourty years old when he began to reigne alone by himſelf; and this I conceive to be moſt probable: nor can I well ſee how we can reconcile that ſeeming contradiction, betwixt the words of the ſacred Scripture, in 2 Kings 8.26. and 2 Chron. 22.2. unleſſe this be taken for granted. Beſides, ſure we are that Jehoſhaphat himſelf did thus; namely, that he made his ſonne Jehoram king in his life time, to wit, about the ſeventeenth yeare of his reigne, happely when he went with Ahab to Ramoth Gilead, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the 2. Kings 1.17. and that having reaſſumed the government to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his return home, afterwards about the twenty firſt or twenty ſecond of his reigne, he again put the government into his ſonne Jehorams hands, ſome two years before he dyed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>Nevertheleſſe, the high places were not taken away.]</hi> In 2 Chron. 17.6. it is ſaid, that he did take away the high places: But the like objection concerning Aſa is anſwered before, Chap. 15.14.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 45. <hi>Now the reſt of the acts of Jehoſhaphat,</hi> &amp;c.] Many of theſe are alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scripture-Chronicles; as firſt, how in the third yeare of his reigne he ſent teachers into all the places of his land where they wanted inſtruction, 2 Chron. 17.7. ſecondly, how he recovered the tribute due unto him by the Arabians and Philiſtines; from the one he had ſilver, from the other he had ſheep and goates to the number of fifteen thouſand and foure hundred: 2 Chron. 17.10, 11. thirdly, how he joyned himſelf in affinity with Ahab, giving his ſonne Joram in marriage to Athaliah Ahabs daughter, 2 Chron. 18.1. fourthly, how being reproved by Jehu the prophet at his return from Ramoth Gilead for helping Ahab, he again viſited his kingdomes, and reformed what he found out of order both in matters of religion and juſtice, 2 Chron. 19.1, 11. and fifthly, how the Aramites or Damaſcens, with the Moabites Ammonites and Idumeans invading the land of Iſrael with a mighty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Jehoſhaphat proclaimed a faſt, and ſought the Lord; whereupon the prophet Jehaziel foretold the victory which ſhould be obtained without any bloudſhed on his part, which accordingly came to paſſe; for the next day theſe nations diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome cauſes amongſt themſelves, thoſe of Ammon and Moab ſet upon the Idumeans and brake them utterly; which done, they alſo ſlew each other, in which broil Jehoſhaphat arriving, took the ſpoil of them all without any loſſe on his part, 2 Chron. 20.1—30.</p>

<pb n="547" facs="tcp:42229:285"/>
Edoms territories; of which in the following verſe: or elſe to note, how to this time God continued this nation in ſubjection to the kings of Judah, though preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after in the dayes of his wicked ſonne they rebelled againſt him: indeed we reade that ſome of the Idumeans were in the field with the Moabites and Ammonites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jehoſhaphat, 2. Chron. 20.10, 22, 23. but firſt theſe might be ſome volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary mercenaries, not ſent out by the ſtate: ſecondly, even theſe it ſeems were not ſo firm as was expected againſt Judah in that expedition, and therefore were ſlain by them of Moab and Ammon, 2. Chron. 20.23. <hi>The children of Ammon and Moab ſtood up againſt the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to ſlay and deſtroy them:</hi> and thirdly, moſt clear it is, that the Idumeans did not declare themſelves, and openly revolt from the crown of Judah, and make themſelves a king, till the dayes of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, 2.

Concerning which, ſee the note, 1. Kings 10.22. Here it is ſaid in the following verſe, that Ahaziah deſired to joyn with Jehoſhaphat in that voyage, and that he would not conſent thereto; but in the 2. Chron. 20.36, 37. it is ſaid, that he did joyn with Ahaziah in this work, and that hereupon the Prophet Eliezer came to him, and reproved him, and foretold that his ſhips ſhould be broken, which accordingly came to paſſe in the very port of Ezion-geber; it ſeems therefore that at firſt when Ahaziah deſired this, Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat would not, but at laſt overcome with the king of Iſraels importunitie he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or elſe, that when a ſecond time Ahaziah deſired again to joyn with Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat in a navy, Jehoſhaphat did then deny him, as it is here ſaid, verſ. 49. as having had ſufficient warning by the loſſe of his former ſhips.</p>

I anſwer, doubtleſſe Ahaziah was made king by his father Ahab, about a yeare or two before Ahab died, and then reigned two years after his fathers death; ſo that he began to reigne, to wit, his father yet living, <hi>In the ſeventeenth yeare of Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and after his fathers death he reigned alſo two years complete.</p>

                     <hi>And he ſent meſſengers, and ſaid unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the God of flies: why he was ſo called it is uncertain, whether becauſe it was ſaid, that this God appeared to his prieſts in the likeneſſe of a flie, and ſo buzzed his oracles into their eares, or becauſe of the ſwarms of flies that were continually in his Temple, by reaſon of the multitude of ſacrifices that were there daily ſlain; or rather, becauſe they ſuppoſed this their idol-god, called here <hi>the god of Ekron,</hi> had power over the flies, wherewith in thoſe hot countreys they were much annoyed, eſpecially in Ekron, which ſtood in a moiſt wet countrey near the ſea; or perhaps, in remembrance of ſome grievous judgement of flies, from which they conceited this their God had delivered them; but howſoever, certain it is, that this idol in time

grew very famous, and thence the Jewes afterwards uſed to call the prince of Devils Beelzebub, Matth. 12.24.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And when the meſſengers turned back,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Expoſitours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that ſo ſoon as Elijah had delivered that meſſage, which God had given him in charge, to Ahaziahs meſſengers, on a ſuddain he was taken away out of their ſight, (for ſo they underſtand the laſt words of the foregoing verſe, <hi>and Elijah departed;</hi> that is, he immediately vaniſhed away) and that this it was that ſo affrighted the meſſengers, that they durſt not go on in their journey: but I rather think with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that Elijahs telling them the ſecret meſſage which they were ſent about, and his foretelling the kings death, made them encline to think he was a prophet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to return preſently to the king that ſent them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And they anſwered him, He was an hairy man,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be meant either that Elijah had much haire on his head or face; or elſe, that he had a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mantle about him: and ſuch indeed it ſeems was the uſuall habit of the prophets in theſe times, ſuitable to the chief ſubject of their preaching, to wit, repentance: Zachary 13.4. <hi>Neither ſhall they wear a rough garment to deceive:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was that the Baptiſt (that he might be known to be a prophet, and that ſecond Elijah, that was foretold ſhould be ſent amongſt them, Mal. 4.5.) was clad after the ſame manner as Elijah was, Matth. 3.4. <hi>And the ſame John had his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Camels haire, and a leathern girdle about his loyns, and his meat was lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts and wild honey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then the king ſent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to apprehend him, as reſolving doubtleſſe to take away his life, to which it is probable, his mother Jezebel did vehemently provoke him: howſoever, herein was the madneſſe of his rage notably diſcovered: had he not thought Elijah armed with a power above that of man, what needed he have ſent a troop of ſouldiers to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend one poore unarmed man: and if he did think ſo, what a deſperate folly was it to fight againſt the Almighty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſpake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath ſaid, Come down.]</hi> This he ſpake by was of deriſion and ſcorn; as if he ſhould have ſaid, you that boaſt your ſelf to be a man of God, and under that pretence take liberty to ſend what bold meſſages you pleaſe to your king; know, that the king by me commands you to come down, and if you obey not his command, here I have thoſe that will fetch you down.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven,</hi> &amp;c.] If I be indeed a man of God, as you onely term me in ſcorn and deriſion, let it be manifeſt in the coming of that to paſſe, which I now foretell; even, that fire may come down from heaven and conſume thee and thy fifty: this he denounced againſt them, out of a ſingular zeal for Gods glory, and by a ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods ſpirit: and therefore when the diſciples of Chriſt, out of a carnall deſire of revenge, would have imitated this act of Elijah; they were reproved by our Saviour; the rather, becauſe they, in regard of the Goſpel, that were called to preach were more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſhew all meekneſſe and gentleneſſe to men, and to deſire rather to ſave then to deſtroy, Luke 9.54, 55. <hi>And when his diſciples James and John ſaw this, they ſaid, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:42229:287"/>
conſume them even as Elias did: But he turned, and rebuked them, and ſaid, Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>O man of God, thus hath the king ſaid, Come down quickly.]</hi> To expreſſe his bold reſolution, and that he feared not to execute the kings command, becauſe of that terrible end which befell the former captain and his fifty; he not onely injoyns the prophet to come down, but preſſeth him alſo to do it ſpeedily, as implying that he would not be delayed, but would dragge him down by force, if he would not yield inſtantly.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah</hi> &amp;c.] Though he had not ſo much faith, and courage, and goodneſſe in him, as to diſſwade the king from ſending again, or to refuſe to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet out of the feare of that vengeance that fell upon thoſe that were ſent before, he humbled himſelf before the prophet, and ſued to him to ſpare their lives.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not come down off that bed, on which thou art gone up,</hi> &amp;c.] We reade not of any violence that the king offered to the prophet when he was come to him, though thus boldly he ſeconded by word of mouth that meſſage which he had formerly ſent him by his ſervants; ſo mightily did God over-aw him, that erewhile was ſo reſolute to be revenged on the prophet; and happely, the unexpected confidence of the prophet, in delivering this meſſage, made him feare that he came armed with power from God, to execute ſome judgement on him, and ſo that might over-aw him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Jehoram reigned in his ſtead, in the ſecond yeare of Jehoram the ſonne of Jehoſhaphat,</hi> &amp;c.] Ahaziah dying without children, his brother Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram a ſecond ſonne of Ahab, chap. 3.1. reigned in his ſtead. But may ſome ſay, Ahaziah his brother began to reign in the ſeventeenth yeare of Jehoſhaphat, 1 Kings 22.51. Jehoram therefore (though we ſhould aſſigne to Ahaziahs reigne two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete yeares, as is there ſaid) muſt needs ſucceed in the nineteenth yeare of Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, who reigned in all twenty five yeares, 1 Kings 22.42. and how is it then ſaid, that he began his reigne in the ſecond yeare of Jehoram the ſonne of Jehoſhaphat: I anſwer, that Jehoſhaphat in the ſeventeenth yeare of his reigne, when he went with Ahab to recover Ramoth Gilead from the Syrians, deſigned as king his ſonne Jehoram, and though when he returned, he reaſſumed the government into his own hands; yet the eighteenth yeare of his reigne (wherein Jehoram the ſonne of Ahab entred upon the crown of Iſrael, chap. 3.1.) is here called the ſecond yeare of Jehoram his ſonne, as counting from his firſt deſignement to the crown in the life of his father.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>ANd Elijah ſaid unto Eliſha, Tarry here,</hi> &amp;c.] God had revealed to Elijah that he ſhould be taken up to heaven; as is manifeſt, verſ. 9. and withall had enjoyned him; firſt, to viſit thoſe ſchools of the prophets which were at Beth-el and Jericho, that he might both by his counſell and prayers leave a bleſſing amongſt them before his departure; and perhaps, that he might put into their hands that prophecy againſt Jehoram the king of Judah; which ſome yeares after
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:42229:287"/>
was to be delivered to him, whereof mention is made, 2. Chron. 21.12. <hi>And there came a writing to him from Elijah the Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. Elijah therefore addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this journey, immediately after which he was to be taken up into heaven, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he knew not what witneſſes God would allow to be preſent at that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous act, and affected not the ſpreading of his fame thereby; or becauſe he deſired to be alone, that he might the better prepare himſelf for this his ſtrange paſſage to heaven; or becauſe he deſired to trie the conſtancie of Eliſhaes love, or whether the Lord had revealed any thing to him concerning his rapture; or laſtly, to make him the more deſirous to go along with him: when he was going from Gilgal he adviſed Eliſha to ſtay there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy maſter from thy head to day?]</hi> This phraſe of taking away Elijah from the head of Eliſha, is either uſed to imply that he ſhould be taken upward to heaven; or elſe rather, in relation to the manner of their ſitting in the ſchools of the Prophets; where Elijah, as the father and teacher of the Prophets, uſed to ſit in a higher place, as it were above their heads, and Eliſha and the reſt at a lower place, as it were at his feet: as it is ſaid of the Apoſtle Paul, Acts 22.3. <hi>that he was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid, Yea, I know it, hold you your peace.</hi> The Lord had revealed to Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, that his maſter ſhould be that day taken up into heaven; yea, as it ſeems, he had enjoyned him to attend diligently his going away, and had perhaps promiſed him, that if he ſaw him when he was taken up from him, he ſhould have a double portion of Elijahs ſpirit, as Elijah afterwards told him, verſ. 10. So eagerly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he intend the expectation of this miraculous rapture of his maſter, that he was loth to entertain the leaſt diſcourſe with the Prophets, leſt his maſter ſhould on a ſudden be taken away, and he not ſee it; and therefore he anſwers them ſo ſhortly, <hi>Yea, I know it;</hi> and enjoyns them preſently to hold their peace.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And fifty men of the ſonnes of the prophets went, and ſtood to view a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off.]</hi> To wit, to ſee the aſſumption of Elijah into heaven; and thus by Gods providence there were many eye-witneſſes of this miracle; and ſo likewiſe had Chriſt many eye-witneſſes of his reſurrection and aſcenſion, 1. Cor. 15.5, 6. &amp;c. and Acts 1.9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Elijah ſaid unto Eliſha, Ask what I ſhall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.]</hi> Thus it was alſo with Chriſt, John 16.23. <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall ask the father in my name, I will give it you:</hi> Epheſ. 4.8. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led captivitie captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Eliſha ſaid, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy ſpirit be upon me.]</hi> That is, ſay ſome, the gift of propheſie to foretell future things, and the gift of working miracles; and others conceive that he asked twice as much of the gift of the ſpirit as Elijah had, out of a zealous unſatisfied deſire to promote Gods glory, and to do good to his people; and accordingly, ſay they, whereas Elijah wrought eight mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Eliſha wrought ſixteen; but I rather conceive, that hereby is meant onely a great and eminent meaſure of the gifts of the ſpirit; double in regard of the other Prophets, as alluding to the priviledges of the firſt-born, Deut. 21.17. he was to ſucceed in the room of Elijah, 1. Kings 19.16. He was to be a father to the ſchools of the Prophets, and to be chiefly imployed in oppoſing the corruptions of the times,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:42229:288"/>
and therefore he craves a double portion of his ſpirit, that he might be furniſhed according to the eminencie of the place, and work he was to undertake.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, Thou hast asked a hard thing,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, that which God doth very rarely afford to any man, no not to his ſervants the Prophets, ſo that to obtain this for thee from God, thou mayeſt well think it is no eaſie thing, <hi>Nevertheleſſe,</hi> ſaith Elijah, <hi>if thou ſee me when I am taken from thee, it ſhall be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee:</hi> and this Elijah preſcribed, as the condition of his obtaining his deſire, becauſe though the ſeeing of Elijah when he was taken away could no way be an advantage in it ſelf to draw down a double portion of his ſpirit upon Eliſha, yet this would be both a triall of his faith, which, where it is in truth, makes men with much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancie and intention of mind, wait for the accompliſhment of Gods promiſes, and that in the uſe of the means which he hath appointed, how unlikely ſoever they ſeem to be for the procuring of the promiſed bleſſing in the eye of our reaſon; and might alſo inform him how vehement his deſire ought to be in ſeeking to obtain that great bleſſing from God which he now deſired, and as a ſigne whereby he ſhould know whether God would grant him his deſire, or no.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>There appeared a chariot of fire, and horſes of fire.]</hi> And thus this zealous fiery ſpirited Prophet, after he had long and happily fought a good fight of faith, and contended for God againſt all the errours and corruptions of his times, was at laſt carried triumphantly in a chariot of fire into heaven, that is, by the holy Angels appearing in the likeneſſe of a chariot of fire, and horſes of fire, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 104.4. <hi>Who maketh his Angels ſpirits, his ministers a flaming fire;</hi> and ſo by this means the Lord did exceedingly honour his faithfull ſervant; and withall, as before the Law, by the taking up of Enoch into heaven, ſo now under the Law, by this rapture of Elijah; and then in the dayes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, by the aſcention of Chriſt, God was pleaſed to give evident and ſenſible proofs, that he hath prepared the heavens for the perpetuall abode of his Saints, and that though our bodies be laid for a time in the grave, yet they ſhall at laſt be taken up into heaven, there to live with God in everlaſting glory; onely they muſt be changed, and of naturall weak corruptible bodies, they muſt be made ſpirituall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious incorruptible bodies; and ſuch a change no doubt there was now made in the body of Elijah, that it might be fitted for heaven.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof.]</hi> That is the ſtrength and defence both of the Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Iſrael, who by his doctrine and prayers, did more for the defence of the Iſraelites; then all their forces of chariots and horſemen could do: and this Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha ſpake, either as bewailing the loſſe of Elijah in this regard; or elſe, to expreſſe his thoughts concerning this manner of Elijahs rapture; namely that becauſe he had been, as <hi>the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof,</hi> for their defence and ſafetie; therefore he was now taken up with a chariot of fire, and horſes of fire, and ſo carried triumphantly into heaven.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>He took up alſo the mantle of Elijah that fell from him.]</hi> When Elijah was caught up into heaven, his mantle fell from him, firſt, to ſhew that he was gone where he ſhould no more have any need of his garments or any ſuch thing: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it might be left to Eliſha, as a token that God had deſigned him to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:42229:288"/>
in Elijah place: out of grief for the loſſe of his maſter, he had torn his own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and now to comfort him again, that very mantle is as it were given him from heaven, wherewith at his firſt calling he was aſſured that he ſhould ſucceed him in his propheticall office.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And ſaid, Where is the Lord God of Elijah;</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe were no words of diſtruſt and doubting, but of invocation and faith, as if he had ſaid, I ſhall now ſee whether the ſpirit of Elijah reſts upon me or no, by attempting to work the ſame miracle; or, O Lord who by thy ſervant Elijah didſt divide theſe waters, make it now manifeſt by the ſame miracle that thou haſt given me the ſpirit of Elijah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And they came to meet him, and bowed themſelves to the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.]</hi> As to the father of the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Lest peradventure the ſpirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and caſt him upon ſome mountain,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note upon the 1 Kings 18.12.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>They ſent therefore fifty men, and they ſought three dayes but found him not.]</hi> Thus through their miſtake, the rapture of Elijah to heaven was confirmed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>But the water is nought, and the ground barren.]</hi> The land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan was a moſt fruitfull land, and had the waters of Jericho been alwayes nought and the ground barren, it is not likely they would have built a city there; or that Hiel the Beth-elite would ſo lately have reedified it in the dayes of Ahab, if it had been then ſo annoyed; but we ſee what the Pſalmiſt ſaith, Pſal. 107.33, 34. <hi>He turneth rivers into a wilderneſſe, and the waterſprings into dry ground: A fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full land into barrenneſſe, for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein.</hi> The ſinnes of the inhabitants (and perhaps the reedifying of Jericho) had brought this curſe upon the place: which now therefore they commend to Eliſhaes conſideration, as expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Lord would now by miracles confirm the calling of this new father of the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Bring me a new cruſe, and put ſalt therein,</hi> &amp;c.] Salt was more likely to make the waters brackiſh, then any way to heal them, and the more was Gods power magnified, who could work this alteration in the waters by ſuch contrary means; as for his appointing the ſalt to be brought in a new cruſe, that might be enjoyned, either, firſt, to make ſure that it ſhould not be any way legally unclean; or ſecondly, to ſignifie the new change that ſhould be made in the waters; or rather, thirdly, that it might not be ſuppoſed that the ſalt had virtue to cure the waters from the cruſe by reaſon of any thing that had formerly been put into it but that it was merely of God that it was effectuall for this end, according to the words of Eliſha in the following verſe, when he caſt the ſalt into the ſpring <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I have healed theſe waters.</hi> And indeed, it is probable, that for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Prophet did appoint the men of the citie to fetch a new cruſe of ſalt; namely, that they might be aſſured that there was no underhand dealing in working this miracle.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And he went up from thence unto Beth-el.]</hi> Having viſited the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Prophets at Jericho, he went thence to that alſo at Beth-el, both to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of Elijahs rapture, and the Lords deſigning him to ſucceed in his place, and to confirm them in the truth, both by his counſel and prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="554" facs="tcp:42229:289"/>
                     <hi>And as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him,</hi> &amp;c.] Beth-el was the chief place where Jeroboams idolatry was practiſed, 1 Kings 12.28, 29. though therefore the prophets had ſeated themſelves there, becauſe there was moſt need of their preſence, where was the ſpringhead of that corruption: yet it ſeems, the inhabitants were moſt of Jeroboams religion, and no marvell then, though the little children had learnt of their idolatrous parents to ſcoff at Gods prophets, as here they did Eliſha, crying after him as he went along, <hi>Go up thou bald-head, go up thou bald-head,</hi> wherein they did not onely revile him with the name of bald-head, but alſo ſcoffed at that report, which, no doubt, was ſoon ſpread abroad of Elijahs rapture into heaven; as if they ſhould have ſaid, you that report your maſter is gone up into heaven, why do not you go up after him? for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed why they ſhould by way of deriſion call upon him to go up the hill, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is thought theſe words were ſpoken, I cannot conceive.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And he turned back, and looked on them, and curſed them in the name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, by authority from God, he pronounced them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed of God; and indeed therefore it is expreſſed, that he looked on them before he curſed them; to intimate, that he did not do it in a ſuddain paſſion, to revenge himſelf, but by the ſpeciall inſtinct of God, and that to puniſh the wickedneſſe of the parents in the death of theſe their miſnurtured children; and to let the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ſee, that if God would ſo ſeverely revenge the reproaching of his prophets in the mouthes of little children; much leſſe would he endure it in thoſe that were of rip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is ſtrange indeed, that the prophet after durſt go to Beth-el; but he went under Gods protection, who was able to defend him, as he had done his maſter Elijah againſt the fury of king Ahaziah; when he had fetched fire from heaven upon his captains and their ſouldiers.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid, I will go up,</hi> &amp;c.] Whether it were out of a deſire that Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat had to be avenged on the Moabites for their defection from the kings of Judah to Iſrael (for being formerly tributaries to David and Solomon, they had left the kings of Judah, and given themſelves for vaſſals unto this time to Jeroboam and his ſucceſſours) or for that they had lately with other nations made warre upon him, and invaded his land, 2. Chron. 20.1. or whether it were becauſe Joram king of Iſrael had put down the worſhip of Baal in his kingdome, and ſo in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he thought he might the more ſafely joyn with him in this warre againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab, though he had been formerly reproved by Gods Prophets, firſt, for aiding Ahab when he went againſt Ramoth Gilead, 2. Chron. 19.2. and, ſecondly, for joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with Amaziah to make ſhips to go to Tarſhiſh, 2. Chron. 20.37. Yet now again he joyned himſelf with Jehoram the ſonne of Ahab, and brother of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah in this his warre againſt the Moabites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And he ſaid Which way ſhall we go up? And he anſwered, The way through the wilderneſſe of Edom.]</hi> That is, Jehoram asked Jehoſhaphat which way they ſhould go; and Jehoſhaphat adviſed them to go the way through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Edom, to wit, either that they might come upon the Moabites by a way they looked not for them; or that they might take the king of Edom and his forces along with him; or elſe, the better to aſſure that nation of the Edomites by the way, of whom they had the more cauſe to be jealous, becauſe ſome of them had lately been in the field at Engaddi againſt Jehoſhaphat, together with the Moabites and the Ammonites, 2. Chron 20.22. <hi>The Lord ſet ambuſhments againſt the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come againſt Judah, and they were ſmitten:</hi> though at this time they were tributaries to Jehoſhaphat, and ſo continued till his ſonnes reigne, 2 Chron. 21.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>So the king of Iſrael went, and the king of Judah, and the king of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.]</hi> That is, the Viceroy of Edom, whom Jehoſhaphat had ſet over them; for as yet they had no king of their own, 2. Chron. 21.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Here is Eliſha the ſonne of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.]</hi> That is, Here is Eliſha the ſervant or miniſter of Elijah: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this particular Elijah made uſe of Eliſhaes ſervice, we need not enquire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was the ordinary imployment of ſervants that attended upon their maſters; therefore with this proverbiall kind of ſpeech this courtier ſpeaks of him as Elijahs attendant, <hi>Here is Eliſhah that poured water on the hands of Elijah:</hi> and no doubt it was by the ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods ſpirit, that Eliſha was come along with the armie into theſe deſerts of Edom.</p>

                     <pb n="556" facs="tcp:42229:290"/>Verſ. 12. <hi>And Jehoſhaphat ſaid, The word of the Lord is with him.]</hi> So he judged, both becauſe he was the diſciple of ſo great a prophet, and perhaps his fame was already ſpread abroad; as alſo, becauſe he conceived there was ſomething in it, that he ſhould be now come with the army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So the king of Iſrael, and Jehoſhaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.]</hi> It was very much that three kings ſhould go down to the prophet, and that they did not rather ſend for Eliſha to come to them, as at other times the kings of Iſrael and Judah were wont to do: but firſt, the great extremity they were now in, might make them deſirous to ingratiate themſelves to Eliſha by all poſſible meanes: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is like enough, that Jehoſhaphat might adviſe him hereto; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe knowing how much the prophets of God were deſpiſed and ſlighted in thoſe dayes, he thought it requiſite, by this great honour done to Eliſha, to let the people ſee how highly they ought to eſteem them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Eliſha ſaid unto the king of Iſrael, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the king of Iſrael had ſuppreſſed the idolatry of Baal in his kingdome, yet becauſe he continued ſtill in the idol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his golden calves, therefore Eliſha profeſſeth to him with great boldneſſe, as became him upon whom the ſpirit of Elijah did reſt; that there was no reaſon that a worſhiper of idols ſhould come to the prophet of the true God, in the time of his extremitie, but ironically wills him, to go to the prophets of his father, and the prophets of his mother, to ſee if they could now yield him any comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nay: for the Lord hath called theſe three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid; Nay Eliſha, do not now charge theſe things upon me, for as it is the Lord that hath brought us into theſe ſtraits, ſo it is he onely I know, that can halp us out, and not theſe idol-gods; which thoſe falſe prophets worſhip thou ſpeakeſt of: yea if ſuccour come not ſpeedily we are like to be undone: you ſee we are like to fall into the hands of the Moabites, if they ſhould come upon us; not I onely, but even theſe kings that are with me, whom I know thou doeſt highly eſteem: it is no time therefore now to chide, but to help; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enquire I pray of the Lord for us, and call upon him that we may be delivered.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I ſtand.]</hi> See the note, 1. Kings 17.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>But now bring me a minſtrell,]</hi> This he called for, either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his affection and to quiet his mind, that was ſomewhat moved againſt Jehoram; or rather, that by ſinging ſome holy pſalm or hymn, both himſelf, and thoſe that were with him preſent, might have their hearts raiſed to ſuch holy and heavenly meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as might render him the fitter to ask and receive propheticall inſpirations, and them the fitter to heare what God would ſay unto them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The hand of the Lord came upon him.]</hi> That is, the ſpirit of propheſie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And ye ſhall ſmite every fenced citie, and every choice citie, and ſhall fell every good tree.]</hi> Thus God by this ſpeciall direction of the prophet gave allowance to the Iſraelites, to do that for the puniſhing of the Moabites, as devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to utter deſtruction, which by the generall rule of the law they might not have done, Deut. 20.19. <hi>When thou ſhalt beſiege a city a long time, in making warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it to take it, thou ſhalt not deſtroy the trees thereof by forcing an ax againſt
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:42229:290"/>
them:</hi> or elſe, that law was meant onely of the warres they were to make againſt the cities in the land of Canaan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And it came to paſſe in the morning when the meat-offering was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that behold, there came water,</hi> &amp;c.] This time God was pleaſed to chooſe wherein to ſend them water, thereby to honour that ſervice which was done him then by his people, and to teach them that all bleſſings come to us by Chriſt (who was the ſumme of all thoſe ſacrifices) and are to be obtained by the prayers of his people: for the time of the morning ſacrifice was alſo the time of publick prayer, Acts 3.1. <hi>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple, at the houre of prayer, being the ninth houre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And they ſaid, This is bloud,</hi> &amp;c.] The gliſtering of the ſunne-beams upon the waters made them think the place where the Iſraelites were to be covered over with bloud; which conceit, was doubtleſſe the more readily entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Firſt, becauſe they never dreamed of any water in thoſe deſerts of Edom, where the Iſraelites lay now encamped: Secondly, becauſe not long before the like had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen their people, when they went with the Ammonites and Edomites againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat; diſſenſion ariſing among them, they fell upon, and ſlew one another, 2 Chron. 20.22, 23. and why might not the ſame now happen amongſt theſe kings that had combined together againſt them? And thus the Moabites were by a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit drawn forth from their borders, which were happely ſtrong, and through which the Iſraelites could not ſo eaſily have broken; being ſo confident of what they ſuppoſed, that they ſent not forth ſcouts to ſee whether it were ſo as they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or no.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And they beat down the cities, and on every good peice of land cast every man his ſtone,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, whereever they came in the land of Moab, they did what they could utterly to ſpoile their countrey, razing their cities, caſting ſtones upon their lands, ſtopping their wells, and felling their trees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Onely in Kir-haraſeth left they the ſtones thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, onely the city of Kir-haraſeth ſtood in her ſtrength and was not razed: to wit, becauſe thither the king of Moab fled with his ſouldiers, and ſo manned it, and defended it againſt the Iſraelites: Kir-haraſeth was indeed the chief and beſt fortified citie in the land of Moab, as we may ſee, Eſay 16.7. and therefore no marvell it is, though that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a ſiege when the other were preſently taken; the king being alſo retired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſhelter with all his forces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Howbeit the ſlingers went about it, and ſmote it.</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though they could not preſently take this city, yet they beſieged it; the ſlingers ſeeking to beat the defendants from the walls, that they might ſcale them, or batter them with engines, or dig them down with mattocks, and ſo take the city; yet ſome by ſlingers here underſtand engineers, which with their engines did force ſtones againſt the walls, to batter them with violence, as now gunners ſhoot bullets.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And when the king of Moab ſaw that the battell was too ſore for him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when he ſaw that his enemies were too ſtrong for him, and were like to prevail and take the city, he ſallied forth with ſeven hundred men upon that quarter where the king of Edom lay, hoping to break through, and ſo to eſcape: neither was it perhaps without cauſe that he choſe to make his ſalley upon Edoms quarter,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:42229:291"/>
for it might be, either, becauſe that quarter was weakeſt; or, becauſe his rage was moſt againſt thoſe their neighbours for helping the Iſraelites; eſpecially, conſidering that a while before the Edomites and they had joyned together againſt Jehoſhaphat, 2. Chron. 20.22. or, becauſe he might hope to find them no ſure friends to this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize of the Iſraelites againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Then he took his eldeſt ſonne that ſhould have reigned in his ſtead,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be meant of the king of Edoms eldeſt ſonne; and ſo it is evident by the contents of this chapter; our tranſlatours underſtood it; to wit, that the king of Moab having the king of Edoms eldeſt ſonne in his power, whether left with him as an hoſtage formerly, or now taken lately in that ſalley which he had made upon the king of Edoms quarters; he took him and ſacrificed him upon the walls of the city: whereupon the Edomites being enraged againſt the king of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, becauſe by his preſſing the continuance of this ſiege, ſo lamentable a miſchief was fallen upon their king and his ſonne, they brake up, and went in a fury away from the camp, and ſo the ſiege was raiſed. But I rather conceive it was the king of Moabs own ſonne whom he ſacrificed: Firſt, becauſe the king of Edom was but a vice-roy, choſen, and ſet over them by Jehoſhaphat (for in his time they had no king of their own, 2. Chron. 21.8.) and therefore he could not have a ſonne that ſhould have ſucceeded him in his throne: Secondly, becauſe this barbarous fact would rather have enraged both the king of Edom himſelf and the other kings to have preſſed the ſiege the more vehemently, that they might come to be revenged on him: better therefore do moſt of Expoſitours underſtand this of the king of Moabs ſonne; to wit, firſt, that finding himſelf in extremity of diſtreſſe, he fled to this laſt refuge, of ſacrificing his own ſonne and heir to his idol-gods, that with ſo pretious a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he might prevail with them for help: and ſecondly, that this he did on the wall, both to let his enemies ſee how reſolved he was ſtill to hold out, and that they might be afraid of the event of ſuch a ſacrifice: and thirdly, that the great indignation againſt Iſrael here ſpoken of, was either that the Edomites moved with this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpectacle, were offended with the Iſraelites for it, and ſo broke up their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and went away; or rather, that after this prodigious act of blind devotion, both the king of Moab, and the inhabitants of the city, were more bitterly enraged againſt the Iſraelites then ever, and were reſolved to fight it out to the laſt man; which the Iſraelites perceiving, and withall perhaps moved with ſome compaſſion, upon that lamentable ſpectacle, they raiſed the ſiege and went away home: As for that place, whereby ſome would prove it was the king of Edoms ſonne that was ſlain, Amos 2.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, for three tranſgreſsions of Moab and for foure, I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof, becauſe he burnt the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</hi> that ſpeaks of burning the king of Edom not the kings ſonne; how ever it may be meant of any other ſalvage act of cruelty in the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites againſt the king of Edom.</p>

rather to pity her, becauſe her husband was one, as Eliſha knew well, that did truly and unfainedly feare the Lord; and indeed obſervable it is, how reſpectively ſhe ſpeaks of her husband, though he had left her in ſo great poverty and diſtreſſe.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſhut the doore upon thee,</hi> &amp;c.] This was enjoyned; firſt, as an act or ſigne, approving or teſtifying her faith, that being left to her ſelf hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of all help and ſuccour from man, ſhe did yet expect from the Lord that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous help which the prophet had promiſed her: ſecondly, as a circumſtance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that it was fit they ſhould pray unto God when they undertook this work, whereto privacy was required: thirdly, that they might not be diſturbed by others, when they were imployed in this buſineſſe they had in hand: but fourthly, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, for the clearer manifeſtation of the intended miracle, that there might be no ſuſpicion, that the oyle was by any body ſecretly conveyed into the houſe to them.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Call this Shunamite, And when he had called her, ſhe stood before him.]</hi> Verſ. 15. it is againe ſaid, that Eliſha bad Gehazi call her; ſo that though it be here expreſſed, that ſhe came and ſtood before Eliſha, yet that which follows muſt be conceived to have been done before her coming: the order of the cariage of the buſineſſe it ſeems, was this: Eliſha ſent Gehazi to call her to him, and withall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to acquaint her with the buſineſſe; namely, that in recompence of her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if ſhe had any ſuit to the king or captain of the hoſt, he would be her media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; ſhe anſwering Gehazi, that ſhe dwelt among her own people; and Gehazi carrying back this anſwer to his maſter, he conſulted with Gehazi what then might

                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhe anſwered, I dwell among my own people.]</hi> In this anſwer is implyed, that ſhe needed not his help in this kind, as intimating, Firſt, that ſhe lived contentedly, and was not ambitious of any better condition, then that ſhe enjoyed in a private quiet life amongſt her own neighbours: Secondly, that ſhe lived peaceably, not having occaſion to complain or ſeek relief from higher powers, not amongſt enemies, but neighbours and friends in a mean condition; nor ſo high as to be envied, nor ſo low as to be trodden on: Thirdly, that if ſhe ſhould have occaſion to ſeek help, ſhe could not want friends, that would do what one man may do for another: yet afterward it was well ſhe found a friend in court, chap. 8.3, 4. to wit, when Gehazi obtained that her land ſhould be reſtored to her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And he ſaid, What then is to be done for her?]</hi> That is, when Geha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi brought back to Eliſha this anſwer of the Shunamites, he asked Gehazi what elſe then there was, wherein they might gratifie her; wherein alſo it is well worth the noting, that though Eliſha were ſo great a prophet, yet he would vouchſafe thus to conſult and adviſe with his ſervant.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And he ſaid, About this ſeaſon, according to the time of life, thou ſhalt embrace a ſonne.]</hi> This phraſe, <hi>thou ſhalt embrace a ſonne,</hi> implyed, not onely the birth of the child, but alſo the ſafety of the child and mother; the time is expreſſed much in the ſame words, as in the promiſe that was made to Abraham, concerning the birth of Iſaac, Gen. 18.10. of which, ſee the note there.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And ſhe went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God,</hi> &amp;c.] All this ſhe did, either as hoping the child might be reſtored to life, by being laid upon the prophets bed, or rather thereby to hide this occaſion of grief from her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and family, leſt they ſhould hinder her in her intended deſigne of going to the

                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>Then ſhe ſaid, Did I deſire a ſonne of my lord? did I not ſay, Do not deceive me?]</hi> That is, why was a ſonne given us, of thy own motion, when I asked no ſuch thing; yea, when I deſired that thou wouldeſt not deceive me with vain hopes, if now my miſery muſt be greater by loſing him, then it would have been by remaining childleſſe? had I offended by too violent deſire of a child, I might have judged that to have been the cauſe why my child is now again taken away; but being given freely without any requeſt of mine, why am I now ſo ſoon deprived of him?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>Then he ſaid to Gehazi, Gird up thy loynes,</hi> &amp;c.] As they uſed to do in thoſe countreys, where they uſed long garments, when they meant to make haſt, and for the ſame cauſe he is enjoyned not to ſtay to ſalute any body by the way. Some think the cauſe of this enjoyned haſte, was to prevent Gehazies vain-glorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of the buſineſſe he was ſent about to any body he ſhould meet with by the way, which might have proved a hinderance to the working of the miracle; but that which others ſay, is farre more probable; namely, that it was onely to make ſure that the child might be reſtored to life before his death came to be known in the family, that ſo the fathers grief might be prevented, and the miracle withall might be concealed.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And laid the ſtaffe upon the face of the child, but there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voice nor hearing,</hi> &amp;c.] Some aſcribe this to want of faith, both in Gehazi and the mother: others think that Eliſha gave that direction for the laying of his ſtaffe upon the face of the child, without any ſpeciall direction or promiſe from the ſpirit of God, onely becauſe he had at other times wrought miracles with this ſtaffe: but rather, I think, it is to be aſcribed to the change of Eliſha his purpoſe, had he not yielded to have gone himſelf, perhaps the ſtaffe might have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall; now the Lord was pleaſed to withhold his power and help till the prophet came.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>And he went up, and lay upon the child,</hi> &amp;c] He applyed his body to the body of the child, ſo farre as it could be done in two bodies of ſuch diſproportion. See the note, 1 Kings 17.21.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>Then he returned, and walked in the houſe to and fro,</hi> &amp;c.] Why he roſe up from lying upon the child to walk to and fro, and then went and lay upon the child again, it is hard to ſay: it is ſaid, that perhaps he was wearied with lying in that manner as he did upon the child, or that perceiving the fleſh of the child to wax warm, as in the foregoing verſe it is ſaid it did, the joy thereof did make him riſe up and fetch a turn, and then preſently he lay down upon the child again: But I rather conceive all this proceeded from the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vehemency and intention of his deſires in ſeeking to God for the reviving of the child; it being uſuall with thoſe that are ſo tranſported with ſtrong deſires to be thus various in their actions, and ſometime to be in one poſture and ſometime in another; as finding no reſt in themſelves, till their deſires be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the child opened his eyes.]</hi> Which was a ſigne that the child was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſtored to life: and thus, as in other miracles, ſo in this.

Elijah multiplyed the widow of Zarephaths oyle, 1 Kings. 17.14. and Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha did as much for a poore prophets widow, verſ. 2: &amp;c. of this chapter: Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah brought rain from heaven after a time of great drought, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, going forth to gather herbs for the pottage, he lighted upon this wild vine, and not knowing it, yet gathered thereof; now it is generally thought that this was Coloquintida, a plant that growes in fields and hedg-rowes, ſomewhat like a vine, the gourds, that is, the leaves and branches whereof are bitter and poyſonous.</p>

Chron. 11.14. and therefore this good man brought theſe twenty loaves of the firſt fruits, &amp;c. to Eliſha and the prophets, who inſtructed the people inſtead of the prieſts, and that the rather out of a care to ſupply their neceſſities in this great dearth that was now in the land.</p>

Had not Ahab his father ſpared the king of Syria, when he had him in his power, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Iſrael.]</hi> That is, they gave over thoſe inrodes into the land, which before had been uſuall with them; and that happely as overcome with the favour which was ſhown them, at leaſt for the preſent, yea and when (perhaps ſome long time after) they did again invade the land, it was not by ſending out ſuch bands of boote-halers as formerly (fearing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, leſt they ſhould be catched in a trap, as now they had been:) but the king ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all his hoſt, and went up againſt them with a power which he thought they would be no way able to reſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his hoſt, and went up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged Samaria.]</hi> This was that Ben-hadad that had once before beſieged Samaria in Ahabs time, 1 Kings 20.1. Then the Iſraelites raiſed the ſiege, and made him fly with ſhame and loſſe; and the rather happely did he now attempt the beſieging of this city again, that be might blot out the reproach of his ſhamefull flight from the former ſiege, encouraged thereto by the great overthrow he had given the Iſraelites, in that battell wherein Ahab was ſlain, 1 Kings 22.34. It may indeed ſeem ſtrange that Naaman, being ſo great with the king of Syria, did not keep him off from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the land of Iſrael; But for this we muſt conſider, firſt, that Naaman might in

this time be dead; or ſecondly, that he durſt not ſhew himſelf ſo farre a friend to Gods people, as to diſſwade the king from this warre; or thirdly, that perhaps he had loſt his place and favour with the king, beacuſe he had embraced the Religion of Iſrael. However, in this ſecond ſiege of Samaria, we ſee how the Iſraelites ſtill ſmarted for Ahabs impious pitty, in ſparing this Ben hadad when he had him in his power.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>An aſſes head was ſold for fourſcore pieces of ſilver,</hi> &amp;c.] Which was as ſome account, about ten pound ſterling But though it were very ſtrange that ſo great a price ſhould be given for an aſſes head, and a clear evidence that they were put to exceeding great ſtraits in Samaria to get food, not onely becauſe there could be but little meat in an aſſes head, and aſſes fleſh muſt needs be very untoothſome; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, becauſe it was an unclean meat, which the Iſraelites, by the Law of God, were forbidden to eat, Levit. 11.13. yet the ſecond inſtance that is here given is farre more ſtrange, to wit, that <hi>the fourth part of a kab of doves dung, was ſold for five pieces of ſilver,</hi> to wit, about twelve ſhillings and ſix pence, and therefore ſome Expoſitours hold, that this doves dung was bought for ſalt or firing; (the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the citie being in as great ſtraits for ſalt or firing, as for food) and others conceive that ſome few ſeeds of corn might be found in the dung, and that for this they bought it; or that the crop of pigeons, in which there will be ſome corn undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, is here comprehended under the Hebrew word here tranſlated <hi>doves dung.</hi> But indeed, why ſhould we think it incredible that they ſhould eat doves dung, when we find afterwards, verſ. 29. that mothers did eat their own children; extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of famine will force men to feed on any thing that is moſt loathſome; whence was that inſulting ſpeech of Rabſhakeh to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, that he would make them <hi>eat their own dung, and drink their own piſſe,</hi> chap. 18.27.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>As the king of Iſrael was paſſing by upon the wall,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to ſee if he could deſcry the attempts of the enemy againſt the citie; and eſpecially to ſee whether the watches were kept, and the walls guarded by his own ſouldiers, as they ought to be.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And he ſaid, If the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?]</hi> If we reade this as it is in the margin of our Bibles, then it ſeems to be a paſſionate ſpeech of the kings, wherein he curſeth the poore woman for troubling him with her outcries (<hi>Let not the Lord ſave thee,</hi> &amp;c.) as if he ſhould have ſaid, the Lord confound thee thou wretched woman; how can I help thee unleſſe God ſend help? but according to the tranſlation that is in our text the meaning is clear; namely, that he did in gentle terms ſeek to ſatisfie the woman, (as thinking ſhe had cried to him for food) that it was not in his power to help her, unleſſe the Lord would ſend them help from heaven.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>I ſaid unto her on the next day, Give thy ſonne, that we may eat him: and ſhe hath hid her ſonne.]</hi> To wit, to ſave her child alive, or with a purpoſe to eat him alone, and not to let her neighbour ſhare with her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Then he ſaid, God do ſo and more alſo to me, if the head of Eliſha,</hi> &amp;c.] Joram the king being deeply affected with that ſad complaint of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had eaten her child (whereby he ſaw, to what extremities the inhabitants of the citie were brought by the famine) in a rage preſently vowed that day to cut off Eliſhaes head, to wit, either becauſe Eliſha had threatned this judgement before it
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:42229:296"/>
came, or, becauſe the king perſwaded himſelf that Eliſha could have procured help by his prayers, as formerly he had done to the army of the Syrians at Dothan, and would not; or elſe, becauſe he had perſwaded the king to hold out the ſiege, and had aſſured him of timely help from God, and ſo now he looked upon him as the cauſe of all the miſery they now lay under: And thus the prophet that erewhiles was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by him as a father, verſ. 21. <hi>My father, ſhall I ſmite them?</hi> is now in a fury deſigned to loſe his head, as if he had been the ſole cauſe of all their miſery.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>But Eliſha ſate in his houſe, and the elders ſate with him.]</hi> That is, ſome of the godly magiſtrates of the city, who were come to conſult with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the miſery of the city and to deſire his prayers, and were now hearing him comforting them and inſtructing them what they ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>See ye how this ſonne of a murderer hath ſent to take away mine head?]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, he is his father Ahabs own ſonne, he was a murderer, to wit the murderer of Naboth and others, and ſo is this his ſonne Joram; for behold he hath ſent one to take away my head.</p>

                     <hi>Shut the doore, and hold him faſt at the doore, is not the ſound of his maſters feet behind him?</hi> &amp;c.] The moſt Expoſitours underſtand this thus; That the prophet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the elders to ſhut the doore againſt the kings meſſenger, and not to let him come in, and that becauſe immediately his maſter would come to recall this ſentence, which in his rage he had paſſed againſt him. But others again hold, that the elders were appointed by the prophet to hold faſt the doore, that the kings meſſenger might not enter in to take off the prophets head, as his maſter the king had appointed him; and that becauſe the king himſelf was coming immediately after him, and then the prophet meant to make known to him how ſuddenly the Lord would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, by ſending them all kind of proviſion in great plenty.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>The meſsenger came down unto him: and he ſaid, Behold this evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?]</hi> This may be the ſpeech either of the meſſenger, or of the king that came immediately after the meſſenger; whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was, it ſeems the prophet had perſwaded the king ſtill to wait upon God; and received this anſwer, that having waited ſo long, it was altogether in vain to wait any longer; they might plainly perceive, that the Lord meant to deliver them into the hands of the Syrians, and therefore to what end ſhould they ſuffer the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtill to periſh for hunger?</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen Eliſha ſaid, Heare ye the word of the Lord.]</hi> It may be this was ſpoken onely to the elders, and that meſſenger mentioned in the latter end of this foregoing chapter, that was ſent to take off Eliſhaes head: But becauſe, firſt, Eliſha did there ſignifie that the king was coming immediately after him; <hi>Is not the ſound of his maſters feet behind him?</hi> And ſecondly, becauſe in the next verſe it is ſaid, that <hi>a lord on whoſe hand the king leaned, anſwered the man of God:</hi> I rather think, the king came preſently after the meſſenger, and ſo this was ſpoken to the king and thoſe that were come with him.</p>

<pb n="570" facs="tcp:42229:297"/>
That is, for two ſhillings and ſix pence: before, an aſſes head was ſold for about ten pound, and a cab of doves dung for about twelve ſhillings and ſix pence; and yet now a meaſure of fine floure, (which was about a peck and a pottle, as moſt account it) ſhould be ſold for a ſhekel, which was about two ſhillings ſix pence, and ſo alſo two meaſures of barley, a mighty change.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Then a lord on whoſe hand the king leaned, anſwered,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours hold that this was that meſſenger mentioned in the latter end of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going chapter, that was ſent to ſlay Eliſha: but me thinks it is plain, that theſe words deſcribe a perſon not mentioned before, and that the king himſelf was preſent when the words of the prophet was thus ſlighted by his great favourite: As for the cuſtome of kings leaning on their nobles hands, ſee chap. 5.18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?]</hi> That is, if the Lord ſhould cauſe the heavens to rain corn, if ſhowers of floure and barley ſhould from the cloudes be poured down upon us, there could not be ſuch plenty.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And there were foure leprous men at the entring in of the gate.]</hi> For they might not be within the city, becauſe they were lepers, Levit. 13.44, 46. but yet withall obſervable it is, how ſcrupulouſly carefull the inhabitants of Samaria were to obſerve that law of God, of not ſuffering the lepers to come amongſt them; yea though they were ready to periſh for hunger, whileſt in the mean ſeaſon they made no bones of tranſgreſſing Gods law in a matter of greater weight and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, by their groſſe idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And they roſe up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians.]</hi> That is, in the twilight of the evening, and it ſeems the Syrians were fled but a little before they came; for of them it is ſaid too, verſ. 7. that <hi>they aroſe and fled in twilight,</hi> and that both muſt be meant of the evening twilight is evident, becauſe it was in the following night; that firſt, the lepers were getting themſelves a booty in the tents of the Syrians, verſ. 9. <hi>If we tarry,</hi> ſay they, <hi>till the morning light, ſome miſchief will befall us:</hi> And ſecondly, that the city was raiſed by them, verſ. 12. <hi>and the king aroſe in the night,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>For the Lord had made the hoſt of the Syrians to heare a noiſe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> &amp;c,] Which yet the lepers nor none in the city heard; the Lord could eaſily have ſtricken theſe Syrians dead in the place, but he was pleaſed rather, as it were in a way of ſcorn and deriſion, to fright them with their own fancies, and to make them fly, not daring to take their very horſes with them, like ſo many mad diſtracted men; when there was not a man near them to do them any hurt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>If we tarry till the morning light, ſome miſchief will come upon us.]</hi> This they ſaid, becauſe they judged it ſo great a fault not to acquaint their brethren with that which God had done for them: when there were ſo many amongſt them that were in danger every moment to periſh with hunger.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>So they came, and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the porter of the gate and the watchmen that were with him.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THe Lord hath called for a famine, and it ſhall alſo come upon the land ſeven years.]</hi> And thus the people continuing in their ſinnes, the judgements of God were doubled upon them. In Elijahs time, God ſent a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine amongſt them, but that laſted onely three yeares and a half, James 5.17. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah was a man ſubject to the like infirmities, and he prayed, and it rained not for the ſpace of three years and a half,</hi> but now this continued full ſeven years.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And ſhe went with her houſhold and ſojourned in the land of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines ſeven years.]</hi> Becauſe it is ſaid of this good Shunamite, that <hi>ſhe went with her houſhold,</hi> &amp;c. it is probably conceived, that her husband being dead, ſhe was at preſent a widow; and a notable diſcovery it was of the Lords high diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people, that in the neighbour countrey of the Philiſtines there was no want, and yet in the kingdome of Iſrael a ſore famine prevailed, yea and in Judah too: for it is not likely this good woman would have ſought the preſervation of her life amongſt the Philiſtines, if ſhe might have done it amongſt her brethren of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah: though the Philiſtines were a wicked people, yet they had not the means of grace as Gods people had; and therefore it is no wonder, though God was moſt provoked with the idolatry and other wickedneſſe of his own people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the king talked with Gehazi the ſervant of the man of God,</hi> &amp;c.] When the Shunamite came <hi>to cry unto the king for her houſe and her land,</hi> (which in the time of her abſence was ſeiſed upon by her kindred, or by the officers of ſtate for the kings uſe) ſhe found the king talking with Gehazi, concerning the miracles which Eliſha had wrought, and ſo by that means found favour with the king, and recovered her eſtate. Some Expoſitours conceive that this was before Gehazi was ſtricken with leproſie, though that be inſerted in the hiſtory before this, chap. 5.21. elſe they think the king would not have talked with him: But without very evident grounds, it is not fit to recede from the order of the hiſtory, I conceive not that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were ever ſo ſecluded from cohabitation with others, but that they might up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion have ſome conference with them; eſpecially it might be ſo here, when the king had ſo great a deſire to heare a true relation of all the wonders that Eliſha had wrought; onely indeed, if this were after Gehazi was a leper, obſervable it is, that notwithſtanding Gehazi did here ſpeak ſo honourably of his maſter, upon whoſe word ſo ſore a judgement had ſeized upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>So the king appointed to her a certain officer, ſaying, Reſtore all that was hers,</hi> &amp;c] The word tranſlated <hi>officer</hi> ſignifies an <hi>eunuch,</hi> as it is in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of our bibles: kings it ſeems in former times had eunuchs to be the chief officers in their courts, whereupon in proceſſe of time all their chief officers were called Eunuchs. As we ſee Potiphar to whom Joſeph was ſold, though he were a married man, is termed an Eunuch. Gen. 37.36.</p>

                     <pb n="582" facs="tcp:42229:298"/>Verſ. 7. <hi>And Eliſha came to Damaſcus, and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was ſick,</hi> &amp;c.] The moſt received opinion is, that Eliſha went now to Damaſcus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a charge given him by Elijah, purpoſely to anoint Hazael king; but why was Elijah ſent from mount Horeb to Damaſcus, if God meant not that he himſelf ſhould anoint Hazael, 1. Kings 19.15. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderneſſe of Damaſcus, and when thou comest anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:</hi> rather therefore I conceive that Eliſha went now by the ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods Spirit, to confirm that to Hazael, by a ſecond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which formerly upon Elijahs anointing, he did not much believe: and that the rather becauſe of the preſent famine in Iſrael, and ſo coming thither found Ben-hadad ſick; whether his ſickneſſe was occaſioned through grief (as Joſephus ſaith) for the ſhamefull flight of his armie from the ſiege of Samaria, chap. 7.6. eſpecially when he heard it was occaſioned by a cauſeleſſe feare, the Scripture expreſſeth not; but onely notes how in his ſickneſſe he was glad to conſult with the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his recovery, whom ere while he ſent to apprehend in Dothan, chap. 6.13, 14. encouraged happely thereto alſo, by the miraculous cure that he had wrought upon the leproſie of his ſervant Naaman.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Go, ſay unto him, Thou mayeſt certainly recover,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thy diſeaſe is not mortall, <hi>Thou mayest certainly recover</hi> of thy ſickneſſe; that therefore which the Prophet addes concerning his death, <hi>howbeit the Lord hath ſhewed me that he ſhall ſurely die,</hi> doth not contradict this which he ſaid concerning his ſickneſſe. The queſtion was whether he ſhould recover of that ſickneſſe wherewith he was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited; to this a direct anſwer is given, that he might well recover, notwithſtanding his ſickneſſe; but withall an intimation is given to the meſſenger that he ſhould ſurely die, to wit, by another means, though not by his ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And he ſettled his countenance stedfaſtly, till he was aſhamed.]</hi> That is, Eliſha did fix his eyes ſtedfaſtly upon Hazael, untill he began to be aſhamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw he could not forbear weeping; or rather, untill Hazael began to bluſh, and to be aſhamed, becauſe he ſaw the Prophet look ſo earneſtly upon him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Eliſha anſwered, The Lord hath ſhewed me that thou ſhalt be king over Syria.]</hi> Intimating, that in this regard it was likely enough he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thoſe cruelties upon the Iſraelites, which now he made ſo ſtrange of; and that becauſe he ſhould then have power to do it, and withall, when once he ſate in the throne of Syria, he would bear the ſame deadly hatred againſt Gods people, which his predeceſſours had done before him, and thence is Damaſcus threatned under thoſe terms, Amos 1.4. <hi>I will ſend a fire into the houſe of Hazael, which ſhall devoure the palaces of Ben-hadad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>He took a thick cloth, and dipt it in water, and spread it on his face,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus Ben-hadad was ſtrangled by Hazael, and that ſo, that no ſigne or token could be ſeen in his dead body of any violence that was offered him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too under a pretence of allaying the diſtemper of heat he was in, by reaſon of his ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And in the fifth yeare of Joram the ſonne of Ahab king of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] Jehoſhaphat had deſigned his ſonne Jehoram to be king, and appointed him to govern the kingdome in his abſence in the ſeventeenth yeare of his reigne, a little
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:42229:298"/>
before he went with Ahab againſt Ramoth Gilead (and thence the yeare of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram king of Iſrael his beginning to reigne, is counted to be both the eighteenth yeare of Jehoſhaphat, 2. Kings 3.1. and the ſecond yeare of Jehoram the ſonne of Jehoſhaphat, 2. Kings 1.17.) but at his return he reſumed the royall power wholly to himſelf, not communicating the ſame again to his ſonne, untill the fifth yeare of Joram king of Iſrael, which was the two and twentieth of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat: and then this old king took unto him this his eldeſt ſonne, as partner in the government, himſelf yet living; the cauſe whereof, in all probabilitie, was ſome diſcord and differences which brake out even then between him and his younger brethren, which as they moved Jehoſhaphat to commit to his younger ſonnes the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of ſtrong fenced cities in Judah, 2. Chron. 21.3. the better to aſſure them, if it might have been, againſt the power of their elder brother; ſo alſo on the other ſide, it cauſed him, to put this his eldeſt ſonne in poſſeſſion of the kingdome, whileſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was living, for fear of tumult after his death.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>In his dayes Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] The Edomites ever ſince Davids time, 2. Sam. 8.14. had been tributaries to the kings of Judah, and had been governed by a Viceroy whom they ſet over them, 1. Kings 22.47. <hi>There was no king in Edom, a deputy was king.</hi> But now they caſt off this yoke, and ſo the prophecie of Iſaac began to take effect, Gen. 27.40. that Eſau ſhould break the yoke of his brother Jacob from off his neck. 2. Chron. 21.2, we reade, firſt, that ſo ſoon as his father was dead, he preſently made uſe of his power againſt his ſix younger brethren; and having gotten them into his hands ſlew them, and, together with them for company, many of the great men of the land, ſuch belike, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formerly or then had taken their part, &amp; that withall he took upon him to make innovations in Religion, erecting high places in the mountains of Judah, and forcing the people to embrace that idolatry which himſelf had learned from the houſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, verſ. 10.11. And theſe combuſtions in the land of Judah, we may well think gave encouragement to the Edomites to revolt at this time, and ſo God puniſhed theſe his abominable courſes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.]</hi> That is, though Joram overthrew the Edomites in that forementioned battel, verſ. 21. yet they retiring into their places of advantage, perſiſted reſolutely in their revolt, and ſo he was forced to return again into his own land; which indeed is not ſo ſtrange, if we conſider, that he might perhaps heare of the revolt of Libnah, a citie in his own countrey, and then no wonder though he ſtayed not to proſecute his victory in the land of Edom.</p>

by him given to the prieſts the ſonnes of Aaron, Joſh. 21.13. and now it rebelled againſt Joram, becauſe he had made ſuch innovations in Religion, and forced the people to idolatry, as is expreſſed, 2. Chron. 21.10, 11. which no marvell though the Levites were leaſt able to endure. It is much indeed that one citie alone ſhould venture upon ſuch an attempt; but perhaps the kings abſence whileſt he was in Edom, and the diſcontent of the people; yea perhaps ſome correſpondence they might have with the Philiſtines (who ere long invaded the land, 2. Chron. 21.16, 17.) gave them hope of abettors, and how they ſped in the concluſion, the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth not.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And Joram ſlept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the citie of David.]</hi> Before his death there was a propheſie in writing delivered him from Elijah the Prophet, 2. Chron. 21.12. which threatned both his people, his children, his wives, and his own body, and immediatly what was threatned came to paſſe: for, firſt, the Philiſtines and Arabians brake into Judea, took the kings houſe, made ſpoil of his goods, and ſlew or carried away all his children, ſave the youngeſt onely; and then afterwards the Lord ſmote him with a grievous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in his bowels, which left him not till his guts fell out, and being dead, he was obſcurely buried in the citie of David, but not in the ſepulchres of his Anceſtours the kings of Judah; and that without the lamentations and ſolemnities that had been uſed in other princes funeralls, 2. Chron. 21.16. All the time of this kings reigne another king of the ſame name reigned in Iſrael, to wit, Joram the ſonne of Ahab his brother in law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Ahaziah his ſonne reigned in his ſtead.]</hi> He is elſwhere called Jehoahaz 2. Chron. 21.17. and Azariah, 2. Chron. 22.6. He was the youngeſt ſonne of Joram, for all the elder ſonnes were ſlain, or carried away by the Philiſtines, 2: Chron. 21.17. In S. Matthews catalogue of the kings of Judah, it is ſaid, Matth. 1.8. that <hi>Jehoſhapoat begat Joram, and Joram begat Ozias,</hi> and ſo this Ahaziah who ſucceeded Joram, and Joaſh who ſucceeded Ahaziah, 2, Kings 11.2. and Amaziah, who ſucceeded Joaſh, 2. Kings 12.21. and was the father of Ozias are quite left out; but this I conceive was onely, becauſe the Evangeliſt reſolving to diſtribute the Anceſtours of Chriſt into three ſeverall ranks (according to the three great changes that had happened in the ſtate, and finding juſt fourteen in the firſt rank from Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to David, he laboured to reduce the other ranks to the ſame number too, as knowing that equall numbers are a help to the memory, and ſo to make juſt fourteen generations in that rank; alſo from David to the captivitie he leaves out Ahaziah, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh, and Amaziah, and them perhaps rather then others, becauſe they were the next from Ahab, by Athaliah the daughter of Ahab and wife of Joram.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>In the twelfth yeare of Joram the ſonne of Ahab king of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] Yet chap. 9.29. it is ſaid, that he began to reigne in the eleventh yeare of Joram king of Iſrael, which is, becauſe the yeare of Ahaziahs reigne did concurre with the latter end of the eleventh, and the beginning of the twelfth yeare of Joram king of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Two and twentie years old was Ahaziah when he began to reigne,</hi> &amp;c.] In the 2. Chron. 22.2. it is ſaid, that he was two and fourty years old when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reigne; we may reconcile this thus, that he was two and fourty years old when he began to reigne alone by himſelf, but that he was made king alſo when he
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:42229:299"/>
was but two &amp; twenty years old, his father yet living; but then that muſt be granted which is before noted upon 1. Kings 22.42. to wit, that Aſa alſo was made king in his fathers life time; and indeed, becauſe this anſwer may have ſome ſtrong objections made againſt it, therefore others do rather reconcile theſe two places thus, to wit, that thoſe words in 2. Chron. 22.2. <hi>Fourty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reigne,</hi> muſt be underſtood of the continuance of Omries pedigree, who was great grandfather to this Ahaziah. Omri reigned as ſole king ſix years, 1. Kings 16.23. Ahab two and twenty, 1. Kings 16.29. Ahaziah his ſonne two, 1. Kings 22.51. Joram twelve, 2. Kings 3.1. And thus Omries ſtock continued fourty and two years; and therefore it is ſaid, that Ahaziah (who was of that ſtock by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Athaliah) in his two and fourtieth yeare began his reigne. But this anſwer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks is more unſatisfactory then the other; the words in 2. Chron. 22.2. will hardly bear ſuch an interpretation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his mothers name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Iſrael.]</hi> That is, the grandchild of Omri, the daughter of Ahab, the ſonne of Omri, verſ. 18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>He was the ſonne in law of the houſe of Ahab.]</hi> That is, the ſonne of Ahabs ſonne in law, to wit, the ſonne of Joram by Athaliah Ahabs daughter; yet perhaps even he alſo by his mother Athaliahs perſwaſion married a daughter of the houſe of Ahab, though by another wife Joaſh was born, who ſucceeded him in the throne, chap. 12.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And he went with Joram the ſonne of Ahab, to the warre againſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael the king of Syria in Ramoth Gilead.]</hi> Toward the latter end of his reigne Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram king of Iſrael undertook the recovery of Ramoth Gilead out of the hands of Hazael then king of Syria (which Ahab his father had formerly attempted with ill ſucceſſe) and Ahaziah the king of Judah his ſiſters ſonne joyned with him in that expedition, as Jehoſhaphat had formerly done with Ahab.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel, of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ramoth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Ramoth Gilead: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wonne the town, and then manned it ſtrongly, leaving the chief of his army there behind him with his captains (of whom Jehu was the chief) he withdrew himſelf to Jezreel to be cured of the wounds which he received in this ſiege of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead.

And yet withall theſe Baalitiſh Ruſſians cannot mention the prophet of God without a flout, <hi>wherefore came this mad fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hither?</hi> for ſuch the prophets were in thoſe dayes eſteemed, becauſe they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded inſpiration from God, and ſpake and did ſometimes what ſuch carnall wretches thought none but mad men would ſpeak or do, Jerem. 29.26. and Hoſ. 9.7.</p>

of the court into the firſt rooms, there (or elſe on ſome ſcaffold to which there was an aſcent, and which they uſed at other times for ſome other occaſions, (as happely, from thence to make proclamation or ſpeeches in the hearing of the people) in ſtead of a throne, they ſet him on their garments laid on a heap; or elſe on ſomething whereon he might be raiſed aloft in the ſight of the ſouldiers, they ſpread their garments, ſo trimming it up by way of honouring him, and to ſignifie their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, and their readineſſe to imploy all that they had for the advancement of his kingdome (as in the like reſpect, we ſee the people <hi>ſpread their garments in the way,</hi> as Chriſt rode in triumph into Jeruſalem, Matth. 21.8.) and ſo having done this, they proclaimed him king: Nor need we wonder, that the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the captains ſhould thus ſuddenly joyn with Jehu againſt Joram their king, and that upon the word of one, whom by way of deriſion they had erewhile termed a mad fellow: for firſt, it may well be that the houſe of Ahab was at this time odious to all, for their horrible wickedneſſe: ſecondly, Jehu was now, it ſeems, commander in chief over the army in Ramoth Gilead, and ſo highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amongſt the captains and ſouldiers: thirdly, when they compared that which was ſpoken by this prophet, who had now anointed Jehu, with that which it was well known Elijah had prophecyed concerning the utter extirpation of Ahabs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, this might much prevail with them: and fourthly, there was doubtleſſe a ſpeciall hand of God inclining them to the ſpeedy furtherance of that which he had determined ſhould be done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Now Joram had kept Ramoth Gilead, he and all Iſrael, becauſe of Hazael king of Syria,</hi> &amp;c.] That Ramoth Gilead was a little before this in the poſſeſſion of the Syrians, is evident, chap. 8.28. where it is ſaid that Ahaziah king of Judah went with Joram the ſonne of Ahab, againſt Hazael king of Syria in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead: again, that Joram did in this expedition winne Ramoth Gilead from the Syrians, is evident in this place, where it is ſaid, that Joram kept Ramoth Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, and verſe 15. where Jehu adviſeth the captains, not to ſuffer any man to go out of the city: It ſeems therefore, that when they had taken the town, though Joram went away to Jezreel to be healed of his wounds: (which was a great advantage for the furtherance of Jehues advancement amongſt the ſouldiers, and is therefore here mentioned) yet he left his army behind him in Ramoth Gilead, either becauſe he feared leſt Hazael ſhould come with ſome forces to recover Ramoth Gilead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain out of his hands, and therefore it is ſaid here, that <hi>Joram kept Ramoth Gilead, becauſe of Hazael;</hi> or elſe rather, becauſe though they had taken the town, yet there was ſome fort or caſtle which the Syrians ſtill held, and for the gaining thereof Jehu and the army was left in Ramoth Gilead.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there, and Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to ſee Joram.]</hi> This is added both to clear the following ſtory, and withall to imply, what ſtate and jollity there was in Ahabs court, when God wrought ſo great a change: doubtleſſe the houſe of Ahab ſince the revolt of Moab, was never in a more flouriſhing condition: there were ſeventy princes of the bloud royall at this time in Samaria, as many Expoſitours ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from that, chap. 10.7. <hi>And it came to paſſe, when the letter came to them, that they took the kings ſonnes and ſlew ſeventy perſons:</hi> Joram had by valiant fight
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:42229:301"/>
recovered Ramoth Gilead from the Syrians, (which his father had attempted in vain) and was indifferently recovered of the wounds he had there received. The king of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah was come thither to viſit him, and fourty princes of his bloud were expected, cha. 10.13. for whoſe entertainment at a time of ſuch rejoycing, no doubt both Joram and Jezebel made great preparations; and yet behold in the midſt of this ſecurity, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs prophecy that was now forgotten, ſhall be fulfilled in their ruine.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And Joram ſaid, Take an horſeman, and ſend to meet them, and let him ſay, Is it peace?]</hi> As fearing that ſome diſaſter had happened at Ramoth Gilead.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Jehu ſaid, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.]</hi> He would not ſuffer the meſſenger to return, leſt Joram being warned by him, ſhould eſcape by flight, or arm himſelf for reſiſtance; and therefore he wills the meſſenger not to talk of peace for Joram, but to follow him; as knowing, that it was in vain for him to attempt to fly back, when he commanded him to ſtay.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the ſonne of Nimſhi.]</hi> That is, the grandchild of Nimſhi: for he was <hi>the ſonne of Jehoſhaphat,</hi> who was <hi>the ſonne of Nimſhi,</hi> ver. 2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And Joram king of Iſrael, and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,</hi> &amp;c.] It was ſtrange that neither of theſe kings ſhould apprehend that they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that were deſcried, when they perceived that they detained the meſſengers that were ſent to know who they were: but thus we uſually find men infatuated whom God intends to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And it came to paſſe when Joram ſaw Jehu, that he ſaid, Is it peace Jehu?]</hi> As if he had ſaid, What is the cauſe of this thy unexpected coming hither? have ye taken the ſtrong hold, which the Syrians held in Ramoth Gilead, by aſſault or compoſition? or have the Aſſyrians come upon you, and put you to flight? or what is the matter that ye are ſo ſuddenly come hither, and in ſo great haſte?</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah ſaw this, he fled by the way of the garden houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, chooſing that as a ſecret way, though he fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Jezreel, yet he durſt not enter the city, but in the ſuburbs, where their garden-houſes were, he turned aſide into ſome by way, hoping by that means to eſcape; but what the ſucceſſe was, the following words do ſhew: Jehu and his captains at laſt overtook him, and ſo they ſmote him at a place by Ibleam, a town that belonged to Manaſſeh, Joſh. 17.11: and ſo flying further after he was wounded, even to Megiddo, there they found him out, and ſlew him. Indeed the words here would ſeem to import, that he dyed in Megiddo of the wounds he received nigh Ibleam, <hi>and he fled to Megiddo and dyed there;</hi> but by the relation of this ſtory in the book of the Chronicles, it is evident, that after the wound he received in his flight he hid himſelf in Samaria, 2. Chron. 22.9. that is, in the kingdome of Samaria; to wit, in Megiddo, whither he fled, and ſo Jehu with his men following him cloſe, at length by making diligent ſearch in the city, there they found him out and brought him to Jehu, and he ſlew him there, 2 Chron. 22.9.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Ahab had ſeventy ſonnes in Samaria.]</hi> That is, ſonnes and grandchildren, and that by ſeverall wives: neither is it any wonder that theſe ſhould be now altogether in Samaria, if we conſider, firſt, that theſe princes of the bloud might be by Jorams appointment aſſigned to ſtay there, when he undertook that late expedition againſt Hazael for the recovery of Ramoth Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, that if any thing ſhould happen to him otherwiſe then well, yet they might be in a place of ſafety; and ſecondly, that perhaps now upon the tidings of Jehues kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Joram, the nobles that had the charge of theſe princes, might preſently fly with them thither for their better ſafeguard.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Then he wrote a letter the ſecond time to them, ſaying, If ye be mine,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus Jezebel that by a letter ſent to the Elders of Jezreel, ſhed the bloud of Naboth and his ſonnes, hath the bloud of all her ſonnes ſhed by a letter, ſent from Jezreel to the Elders of Samaria.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And he ſaid, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entring in of the gate, untill the morning.]</hi> To wit, that the people going out, and coming in the next morning at the gate of the citie, might be eye-witneſſes of the juſt judgement of God upon the houſe of Ahab; and that the people flocking together to ſee this ruefull ſpectacle, he might find them there, and ſo might take that occaſion to juſtifie himſelf amongſt them concerning all that he had done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Ye be righteous, Behold, I conspired againſt my maſter, and ſlew him, but who ſlew all theſe?</hi> &amp;c.] This ſpeech of Jehues is diverſly expounded by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters: ſome conceive they were ſpoken to the people that were aſſembled together to gaze on the heads of Ahabs ſeventy ſonnes, that were laid on two heaps at the gate of Jezreel; and that he began with thoſe words, <hi>Ye be righteous:</hi> either hereby to ſhew why he was willing to appeal to their judgement for that which he had done; as if he had ſaid, you are ſurely innocent, and have had no hand in any thing that hath been done againſt the houſe of Ahab; and therefore I deſire to appeal to you, whether it be not manifeſt, by this ſtrange act done to the ſonnes of Ahab, that God meant to have his vengeance executed upon this curſed family; or elſe, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them that he meant no evil to them; <hi>Ye be righteous,</hi> that is, I pronounce you innocent, think not that I intend any harm to you; and ſo he firſt quits the people from fear, and then afterwards ſeeks to clear himſelf in the following words, in that which he had done, by ſhewing that he had onely executed what God had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhould be done, as he proves was manifeſt, by the death of thoſe ſeventy perſons that could never thus have loſt their lives, if there had not been a ſecret hand of God, furthering herein the accompliſhment of that which he had long ſince threatned by the Prophet Elijah; <hi>Behold, I conspired againſt my maſter, &amp; ſlew him, but who ſlew all
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:42229:302"/>
theſe?</hi> But then again others conceive, that theſe words were ſpoken to thoſe that had cut off theſe heads of Ahabs ſonnes; or to them joyntly together with the reſt of the people, and that ironically, <hi>Ye be righteous;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, you take your ſelves to be righteous, and would lay all the blame of that which is done upon me; but this fact of yours hath now made us equally ſharers in this buſineſſe; <hi>Behold, I conſpired againſt my maſter, and ſlew him, but who ſlew all theſe?</hi> that is, ſuppoſe that I ſhould be charged for conſpiring againſt, and killing my maſter, yet theſe heads I am ſure you cut off, and not I; yea indeed, neither you nor I have done any thing herein, but what God would have done; it was not my letter that could have wonne you ſo readily to perform ſuch an act as this, ſeeing many wayes you might have ſecured both your ſelves and them; but that there was a ſpeciall hand of God in it, who would have that fulfilled which he had threatned by Elijah; which is more fully expreſſed in the following verſe; <hi>Know now that there ſhall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord, for the Lord hath done that which he ſpake by his ſervant Elijah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>So Jehu ſlew all that remained of the houſe of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his prieſts.]</hi> That is, his houſhold-prieſts, neither is it any wonder that this cauſed not the prieſts of Baal to ſuſpect him, when afterwards he called them altogether to Samaria: becauſe the ſpeciall reference which theſe had to the family of Ahab, might be thought the onely cauſe of his cutting them off, that they might not in time to come plot any thing by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the ſonnes of his brethren, 2. Chron. 22.8. (for all his brethren, the ſonnes of his father Jehoram, were either ſlain, or carried away by the Philiſtines and Arabians that had lately broken into Judah, 2. Chron. 22.1.) and theſe he ſlew too, leſt they ſhould hereafter revenge the death of Ahaziah, or lay any claim to the crown of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And he ſaid, Take them alive.]</hi> That is, Jehu commanded his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to take theſe brethren of Ahaziah alive, both that he might be ſure that none but thoſe of the ſtock of Ahab were ſlain; and withall, that they might be made to know why they were put to death; namely, becauſe they were of the curſed ſtock of Ahab.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>He lighted on Jehonadab the ſonne of Rechab,</hi> &amp;c.] This man was a Kenite of the ſtock of Jethro, 1. Chron. 2.55. the ſame that either now or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impoſed upon his ſonnes an auſtere rule of civilitie, Jer. 35.6. that they ſhould drink no wine, nor build houſes, nor ſow ſeed, nor plant vineyards, nor have any; but ſhould all their dayes dwell in tents, and that (as is moſt probable) the better to preſerve them from being corrupted with the growing luxury of thoſe times, and to inure them beforehand to hardneſſe, that they might be the better able to bear the miſery which he foreſaw the ſinnes of the people would bring upon them: It ſeems he was a man of great note, eſpecially for his piety in theſe times, and therefore Jehu the rather deſired to be countenanced by him, and to have his approbation of his zealous proceedings: whence it was that he took him into his chariot, and carried him to Samaria; onely, firſt he queſtioned him whether he did
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:42229:303"/>
from his heart approve of his proceedings or no, <hi>Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is thy heart faithfull towards me, as mine is towards thee?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>But Jehu did it in ſubtilty, to the intent that he might deſtroy the worſhippers of Baal.]</hi> When Jehu had ſlain Ahab and all his poſterity, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been the great promoter and ſupporter of the Baalites, it is likely that in all places they began to ſhift for themſelves, and to hide their heads, as fearing what he would do to them: becauſe therefore it would have been then hard to have any way ſurprized them ſeverally, and becauſe withall the taking of any open way of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt them, might have cauſed ſome ſedition in the kingdome, he thought it the wiſeſt way, thus to catch them in a ſnare altogether, by pretending for Baal, and proclaiming a ſolemn aſſembly for his ſervice; but how farre this blemiſhed his zeal againſt that horrible idolatry, we may judge by that rule of the Apoſtle, that <hi>we may not do evil that good may come of it;</hi> Rom. 3.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Search, and look that there be here with you none of the ſervants of the Lord.]</hi> This Jehu ſpake, as pretending, no doubt, that he would not have the worſhip of Baal prophaned by the preſence of any that were not cordiall to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but withall intending to ſave them from the ſword, (what ever they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) if curioſity perchance ſhould have drawn any of them thither.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And it came to paſſe aſſoon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, aſſoon as the chief prieſt of Baal had made an end of their ſacrifice, which they had undertaken by Jehues encouragement; ſo long it ſeems Jehu deferred the execution, that if they were not all yet come thither, he might be the ſurer to have them all there, ere the ſouldiers were let in upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And went to the city of the houſe of Baal.]</hi> Many Expoſitours take this indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely; to wit, that the guard and the captains went into every city where there was any temple dedicated to Baal, and beat down the temples, and deſtroyed the images, whence they ſay, that is added verſ. 28. <hi>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Iſrael:</hi> But me thinks the words ſeem here rather to imply their going firſt to ſome citie near Samaria, which was particularly dedicated to Baal, where was Baals chief temple; of which I conceive that is ſpoken verſ. 27. that <hi>they brake down the houſe of Baal, and made it a draught-houſe unto this day;</hi> for it is not probable, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry houſe of Baal thoroughout the kingdome, was turned into a jakes, but onely his chiefe temple, thereby to expreſſe their deteſtation of that idolatry, wherewith the kingdome of Iſrael had been defiled.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Jehu,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by ſome prophet that he ſent unto him, perhaps Eliſha or the young prophet that was ſent to anoint him: though Jehu continued in the idolatry of Jeroboam, yet becauſe the ſuppreſſing of the idol-worſhip of Baal, and the rooting out of Ahabs poſterity, was in it ſelf a good ſervice, God promiſed here that kingdome to his heirs unto the fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which was accompliſhed in the mediate ſucceſſion of Jehoahaz, and Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Jeroboam, and Zachariah, chap. 13.1. and chap. 14.16. and verſ. 29.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>In thoſe dayes the Lord began to cut Iſrael ſhort,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, to abate their power, and to make ſore havock amongſt the people; for ſo this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the next words, <hi>And Hazael ſmote them in all the coasts of Iſrael:</hi> and then no doubt did he exerciſe thoſe inhumane cruelties upon the Iſraelites, of
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:42229:303"/>
which Eliſha had foretold him, chap. 8.12. <hi>I know the evil that thou wilt do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the children of Iſrael, their ſtrong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, and their young men wilt thou ſlay with the ſword, and wilt daſh their children, and rip up their women with child.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah ſaw that her ſonne was dead, ſhe aroſe, and deſtroyed all the ſeed royall.]</hi> That is, all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the bloud royall that were left. Joram had killed his ſix younger bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the ſonnes of Jehoſhaphat, immediately upon the death of his father, 2 Chron. 21.2, 4. after that all his own ſonnes (ſave onely Ahaziah the youngeſt, who ſucceeded him in the throne) were either ſlain, or carried away by the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines and Arabians, 2. Chron. 22.1. again, after that fourty two princes of the royall bloud Jehu had ſlain, chap. 10.13, 14. ſo that it may ſeem there were not many of the ſeed royall left. Athaliah therefore (that happily was left by her ſonne Ahaziah to govern the kingdome, when he went to help Joram in his warre) taking this advantage of the ruines of this royall family, did forthwith lay hold upon thoſe few of the princes of the bloud that were left, and ſlew them, that ſo ſhe might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the royall throne her ſelf, and ſo ſettle the worſhip of Baal in the kingdome of Judah, which to her grief ſhe ſaw was now rooted out by Jehu in the kingdome of Iſrael. If theſe princes, whom ſhe ſlew, had been onely the grandchildren of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat, by ſome of his other ſonnes, and not by her husband Joram; or had they been her husbands children by ſome other wives, this fact had been the leſſe to be wondered at: but by the ſaving of her own ſonnes ſonne out of her hands, to wit, Joaſh the ſonne of Ahaziah, it is manifeſt, that ſhe ſpared not her own children: and this indeed is moſt ſtrange, that ſhe ſhould be ſo unnaturall, eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo, that under the title of being protectour to her young grandchild Joaſh, ſhe might with more eaſe and ſafety have done what ſhe liſt in the kingdome, and ſo have made better uſe of his life then of his death: but for this it may be anſwered; firſt, that ambition and zeal for Idolatry do uſually blind men and women, and make them moſt unnaturally cruell: Secondly, that there might be other reaſons inducing her thereto (though they be not expreſſed in the Scripture) as for inſtance, perhaps ſhe might have other ſonnes and grandchildren; either by adultery, or by a former husband, or by ſome daughter of Jorams, upon whom ſhe might rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſettle the crown of Judah, perhaps thoſe that brake up the houſe of God, and beſtowed the dedicated things thereof upon Baalim, 2. Chron. 24.7. <hi>For the ſonnes of Athaliah that wicked woman, had broken up the houſe of God, and alſo all the dedicate things of the houſe of the Lord did they beſtow upon Baalim.</hi> Thirdly, howſoever ſure we are, that there is no wickedneſſe ſo unnaturall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable whereinto a wicked woman may not run raiſed up of God to be a plague to wicked and idolatrous people: and beſides there was a ſpeciall hand of God in it, that thoſe that were deſcended from Ahab, (though onely by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:42229:304"/>
ſide might be deſtroyed, ſave onely Joaſh, who was left to ſucceed in the throne of Judah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>But Jehoſheba the daughter of king Joram, ſiſter of Ahaziah, took Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh the ſonne of Ahaziah,</hi> &amp;c.] This Jehoſheba, or Jehoſhabeath, 2. Chron. 22.11. the ſiſter of Ahaziah, and daughter of Joram, was married to Jehoiada the high prieſt, as is noted in that place of the Chronicles before cited; and therefore it is not likely that ſhe was the daughter of Joram by Athaliah, but by ſome other of his wives, becauſe we cannot well think that he would have taken a wife of that curſed idolatrous ſtock. But however, ſiſter ſhe was to Ahaziah the late king of Judah, and therefore hearing of Athaliahs bloudy project, ſhe ſtole this young infant her brothers youngeſt ſonne out of the nurſery, and hid him with his nurſe in the bed-chamber, that is, in ſome bedchamber of the prieſts, which were adjoyning to the Temple, and ſo kept him cloſe ſix years together: how it came to paſſe that this young<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> late-born infant was not miſſed, or being miſſed, was not hunted after, and by diligent ſearch diſcovered, it is hard to ſay; moſt probable it is, that ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or cunning was uſed, as by the ſubſtitution of ſome other child in his room, whether dead or living, or by corrupting thoſe Athaliah had imployed in this bloudy ſervice, or ſome ſuch way, by which means Athaliah might verily think he was killed with the reſt; or if ſhe had ſame ſmall ground to ſuſpect any thing to the contrary, ſhe might in policie forbear to make any noiſe of it, leſt the people hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a rumour, ſhould be the readier to hearken after innovations, and be the leſſe conformable to the preſent government. However, becauſe Joaſh this young infant thus miraculouſly ſaved, is expreſſely here called the ſonne of Ahaziah, and ſo elſewhere conſtantly, verſ. 4.12. chap. 12.18. 2. Chron. 22.11. 1. Chron. 3.11. it is therefore no way probable, which ſome affirme, that he was of the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Nathan, and ſucceeded in the throne, becauſe all Solomons poſterity was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by Athaliah; eſpecially if we conſider that the reaſon intimated in theſe words why Jehoſheba preſerved him, was becauſe of her near alliance to him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aunt his fathers ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the ſeventh yeare Jehoiada ſent and fet the rulers over hundreds, with the captains, and the guard,</hi> &amp;c.] When Athaliah had uſurped the crown of Judah ſix years, and ſomewhat more, without any diſturbance either of domeſticall adverſaries, or forreigne enemy (for Jehu had enough to do at home to oppoſe the victorious armies of Hazael, wherewith he was ſo farre overcharged) at length Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada began to think of ſettling him in the throne, to whom of right it did belong, who was now full ſeven years old, verſ. 21. <hi>Seven years old was Jehoaſh when he began to reigne;</hi> and had been hitherto hid in a cell of the Temple by his wife Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſheba, not judging it fit to conceal him any longer, firſt, that his young ſoveraigne might not want that princely education which was requiſite, and whereof his years began now to be capable: and ſecondly, that the idolatry of Baal might not by her means take too deep root before it were weeded up; having therefore firſt imparted this ſecret to five of the chief captains of the land, in whoſe fidelitie he had beſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and made a covenant with them, afterward by their means he drew in others of the principall men of the countrey (both the Levites and others) onely at firſt procuring that they ſhould repair to Jeruſalem, where they ſhould be further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:42229:304"/>
with the whole matter, 2. Chro. 23.1, 2. and ſo accordingly being met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as is here expreſſed) in the temple, having taken an oath of ſecrecy and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them, he ſhewed them the kings ſonne, made a covenant with them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him to the kingdome, and reſolved how the buſineſſe ſhould be managed the next ſabbath day in every particular, as is expreſſed in the ſequel of the ſtory. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome Expoſitours conceive, that thoſe five mentioned, 2. Chron. 23.1. to whom Jehoiada did firſt impart the buſineſſe, were prieſts and Levites, and ſo alſo all that were imployed in this ſervice; and that becauſe they managed this buſineſſe in the temple, whither none (ſay they) but thoſe of the tribe of Levi might enter; but yet conſidering that the court of the people was a part of the temple, and within the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tes thereof, and withall becauſe thoſe five men are expreſſely termed <hi>captains of hundreds,</hi> and it is ſaid, that they gathered to them not onely <hi>the Levites,</hi> but alſo <hi>the chief of the fathers of Iſrael,</hi> 2. Chron. 23.1, 2. I ſee not why they ſhould hold that they were onely Levites that Jehoiada did now call in to his help.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>This is the thing that ye ſhall do; a third part of you that enter in on the ſabbath,</hi> &amp;c.] This he ſpake to the Levites, the Levites were by an order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed long ſince amongſt them by David, divided into foure and twenty orders or companies, which did in their courſes, each company a week diſcharge the ſervice of the temple (the reſt abiding the whileſt in their own private dwellings, in the ſeverall cities of Judah) and ſo every ſabbath day, they that had ſerved the week before went out, and another came in that ſerved in their room: and in each company or courſe there was in Davids time a thouſand Levites, beſides the porters and ſingers. Now therefore becauſe the aſſociates of Jehoiada were not able to bring together ſecretly ſo many truſty and ſerviceable hands, as would ſuffice to mannage the buſineſſe; to help this want, Jehoiada reſolved to arm the Levites for the work, and to the end they might be the ſtronger, he took in the new company that were to come in on the ſabbath, and did not diſcharge the old that ſhould have then gone out, but retained them ſtill, and ſo by that meanes without any noiſe he had made up ſuch a number as would be able to deal with the queens ordinary guard; for in probability they might be about three thouſand men; which accordingly under the command of their ſeverall captains, (either the chief of the Levites, or thoſe commanders of ſouldiers whom he had ſworn his aſſociates in this deſigne) he thus diſpoſed of; thoſe that were newly to enter in that ſabbath unto the ſervice of the temple, (for the work it ſeems was to be done on the ſabbath day) he divided into three parts, one part whereof he aſſigned to watch at the gate of the outer court that led to the kings palace, which was the north gate, the ſame it ſeems which is called, verſ. 19. <hi>the gate of the guard,</hi> where Athaliah now was, that no body might thence break in upon them: another part he aſſigned to be <hi>at the gate of Sur;</hi> which was the eaſt gate that led into the city, called alſo <hi>the gate of the foundation,</hi> 2. Chron. 23.5: another part to ward at the ſouth gate, called here <hi>the gate behind the guard;</hi> that is, the gate right oppoſite againſt that gate where the kings guard uſed to ſtand, which led to the kings houſe: Again, thoſe that were to go out from the ſervice of the temple that ſabbath, he divided into two parts, and appointed them to be a guard in the temple unto the kings perſon, the one on his right hand, the other on his left: Many conjectures I find amongſt Expoſitours very different from this which I have
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:42229:305"/>
noted both concerning the diſpoſing of the Levites, and concerning the gates at which they were ſet; but herein it is hard indeed to determine the certainty, becauſe the paſſages are ſo obſcure.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6, <hi>So ſhall ye keep the watch of the houſe that it be not broken down.]</hi> That is, that the watch be not diſordered by the breaking in of any body; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the temple may be profaned by the ruſhing in of thoſe, that ought not to enter into it; the perſon of our young king may be endangered, and the buſineſſe we have in hand may be utterly overthrown.</p>

Theſe ſpeares and ſhields might be ſuch as David had taken in the warres, and had laid up in the tabernacle, as he did the ſword of Goliath, as memorials of the great victories that God had given him, which were afterward by Solomon removed into the temple; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I conceive, that there was an armoury in the temple provided purpoſely, that they might be in a readineſſe for the guarding and defence of that holy place upon all occaſions, and that becauſe there were now found there weapons for ſo many thouſands as were at preſent imployed; and happely becauſe for this as for other things, David had given directions to his ſonne Solomon, therefore they are called here, <hi>Davids ſpeares and ſhields that were in the temple:</hi> had they been to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chron. 23.12. <hi>Athaliah heard the noiſe of the people running and praiſing the king</hi>) ſhe went to ſee what was done in the temple, not any whit ſuſpecting that which was done, and ſo through the providence of God, did unwittingly caſt her ſelf into their hands: nor was it againſt the charge given by Jehoiada, verſ. 8. <hi>he that cometh within the ranges, let him be ſlain:</hi> that ſhe was ſuffered to come within the ranges, becauſe ſhe came not in an hoſtile manner, but quietly came in amongſt them without any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt or fear, and it muſt needs be known to be of great advantage to get her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their power.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And they laid hands on her, and ſhe went by the way by the which the horſes came into the kings houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of the way into the citie, where was the <hi>horſe gate,</hi> mentioned, Neh. 3.28. and Jer. 31.40. but the words do clearly enough ſhew that it was the ordinary horſe and cart way that led into the court, where were the ſtables and other out-houſes that belonged to the kings palace, and therefore it is ſaid, verſ. 20. that <hi>they ſlew Athaliah with the ſword beſide the kings houſe:</hi> even in the place of her death they ſought to caſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch upon her; her mother Jezebel was troden under the horſe heels, and now ſhe was dragged by the horſe way, and ſlain amongſt the ſtables and dunghills of the kings houſe.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And Jehoaſh ſaid to the priests, all the the money of the dedicated things,</hi> &amp;c.] The Temple was at this time ſallen into great decay, through the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of former kings, but eſpecially of Athaliah <hi>For the ſonnes of Athaliah that wicked woman,</hi> 2. Chron. 24.7. <hi>had broken up the houſe of God, and alſo all the dedicate things of the houſe of the Lord did the beſtow upon Baalim:</hi> the firſt act therefore that Jehoaſh took in hand when he began to rule without a protectour, was the reparation of that holy place; as indeed moſt requiſite it was that he ſhould be carefull to uphold the Temple, that had been the nurſery of his infancy, and the beſt means to ſecure his life, and to uphold his juſt title to the crown of Judah, and to this end he enjoyned the prieſts carefully to gather <hi>all the money of the dedicated things,</hi> that is, all the money dedicated to the ſervice and repair of the Temple, and then the particulars are expreſſed (purpoſely I conceive to diſtinguiſh this money
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:42229:306"/>
from that which was brought in for the uſe of the prieſts themſelves, as the money for the redemption of the firſt born and ſuch like) namely, firſt, <hi>the money of every one that paſſeth the account:</hi> that is, the half ſhekel that they were to pay when they were numbred from twenty years old and upward, Exod. 30.12, 13. which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, 2. Chron. 24.6. <hi>the collection of Moſes the ſervant of the Lord, and of the congregation of Iſrael for the tabernacle of witneſſe;</hi> and verſ. 9. <hi>the collection that Moſes the ſervant of God, laid upon Iſrael in the wilderneſſe:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, ſee the notes, Exod. 30.12, 13. ſecondly, <hi>the money that every man is ſet at;</hi> that is, the money which any man ſhall by the prieſt be appointed to pay for his redemption, when he hath vowed himſelf to God, according to that law, Levit. 27.2. &amp;c. of which ſee the note there: and thirdly, <hi>all the money that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into any mans heart to bring into the houſe of the Lord;</hi> that is, which any man ſhall voluntarily give for the reparation of the houſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Let the prieſts take it to them, every man of his acquaintance.</hi> In 2. Chron. 24.5. it is ſaid that Joaſh appointed them to go out unto the cities of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and gather this money from yeare to yeare; this receiving it therefore every man of his acquaintance, is meant of their gathering it in the ſeverall cities where they dwelt; (for the Levites were diſperſed in ſeverall cities of Judah) where they were acquainted, and well known amongſt the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it in for the breaches of the houſe.]</hi> That is, he enjoyned them to meddle no more with the receiving of the money, but to pay in that which they had already received, when the king firſt ſet on foot this work: as he appointed them to collect the moneyes above mentioned for the repairing of the temple, ſo alſo he charged them to haſten the work, 2. Chron. 24.5. <hi>Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Iſrael money to repair the houſe of your God from yeare to yeare, and ſee that ye haſten the matter:</hi> when therefore in the twenty third yeare of his reigne, he ſaw that yet nothing was done, he took it for granted that either they had been negligent in collecting the money, or that they did not faithfully pay in what they received; or at leaſt, that the people ſuſpecting their diverting of it to their own private uſes, did not pay it ſo willingly as otherwiſe they would; and therefore he took the work out of their hands, and appointed another way for the gathering of the money as is afterward expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>But Jehoiada the prieſt took a cheſt, and bored a hole in the lid of it,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by the command of the king, 2. Chron. 24.8. to prevent all ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the time to come of any corruption in this buſineſſe: firſt, they made this cheſt whereinto the money ſhould be put, and wherein it ſhould be kept; and then they made a proclamation throughout the kingdome, that every man ſhould bring in the appointed contribution, which accordingly was done with much alacrity and willingneſſe, 2. Chron. 24.9, 10.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Howbeit, there were not made for the houſe of the Lord, bowls of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſnuffers,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, not till the temple was fully repaired, but when that
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:42229:306"/>
work was finiſhed, the money that was left was imployed in making theſe veſſels for the houſe, 2. Chron. 24.14.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>The treſpaſſe-money, and ſinne-money was not brought into the houſe of the Lord: it was the prieſts.]</hi> That is, the money which by the law thoſe men were to pay by way of ſatisfaction, according to the eſtimation of the prieſts that had any way wronged the Lord in his holy things, Levit. 5.15. whether it were done ignorantly or wittingly, in both the caſes ſatisfaction was to be made, and the one of theſe is called treſpaſſe-money, and the other ſinne-money.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Then Hazael king of Syria went up.]</hi> Notwithſtanding this fair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Jehoaſh his reigne, no ſooner was Jehoiada dead, but by his flattering princes he was drawn away to the worſhip of idols, and ſo wrath came upon Judah and Jeruſalem for this their treſpaſſe, 2. Chron. 24.17, 18. namely, by Gods let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting looſe Hazael king of Syria upon them, as is here ſaid; from whom they were fain to purchaſe their peace by a great ſumme of money, as is expreſſed, verſ. 18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And his ſervants aroſe, and made a conſpiracie, and ſlew Joaſh,</hi> &amp;c.] Some other paſſages are recorded in the Chronicles not here expreſſed, as firſt, when ſundry prophets had in vain laboured to reclaim both king and people from their idolatry, at length Zachariah the ſonne of Jehoiada the prieſt, was by the Spirit of the Lord ſtirred up to admoniſh them of their wickedneſſe, who did it accordingly with great courage, aſſuring them that this was the cauſe of Hazaels prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: whereupon a conſpiracie was made againſt him, and by the kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment (who forgat what his father Jehoiada had done for him) he was ſtoned to death: ſecondly, that according to the prayer of this bleſſed Martyr at his death, <hi>the Lord look upon it, and require it,</hi> before that yeare was expired, the Syrians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the land again, and executed the judgements of God with great ſeveritie, for though the Syrians it ſeems came rather to pillage, then to perform any great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for they came with a ſmall company of men) and Jehoaſh went out againſt them with a very great army, yet by the providence of God, this ſmall band of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian rovers, overthrew that great hoſt of Judah, wherewith being encouraged, they went up againſt Jeruſalem, and deſtroyed all the Princes of the people, who had drawn away their king from the worſhip of the true God, and ſent all the ſpoil of them to the king of Damaſcus; and as for Jehoaſh they left him in ſore diſeaſes (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by tortures they had put him to) which advantage two of his ſervants appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending they made a conſpiracie againſt him, and ſlew him in his bed when he had reigned fourty years, verſ. 1. to wit, two and twenty years with Jehu, and the reſt with his ſonne Jehoahaz, and his grandchild Jehoaſh, which is largely related, 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And he delivered them into the hands of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hands of Ben-hadad the ſonne of Hazael, all their dayes.]</hi> That is, all the time of the reigne both of Jehu the father and Jehoahaz his ſonne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4, <hi>And Jehoahaz beſought the Lord.]</hi> Namely, when he was brought ſo low by the Syrians that he had not left him above fifty horſmen, and ten chariots, and ten thouſand footmen, as is afterward expreſſed, verſ. 7.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the Lord gave Iſrael a ſaviour,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Joaſh the ſonne of Jehoahaz, who afterward prevailed mightily againſt the Syrians, and after that alſo Jeroboam his ſonne, chap. 14.27. ſo that afterward <hi>the children of Iſrael dwelt in their tents as beforetime;</hi> that is, they dwelt in their houſes quietly and peaceably: ſee the note, 1 Kings 12.16.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>The king of Syria had deſtroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threſhing.]</hi> That is, he had broken them to pieces, and ſcattered them (as corn may be with too much threſhing) ſo that ſcarſe any where was there an army together, and they were become a people of no power and no eſteem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Now the reſt of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might,</hi> &amp;c,] That is, with what courage and valour he reſiſted the Syrians, though they ſtill prevailed againſt him; which is the rather noted to make it manifeſt that the calamities that befell the Iſraelites in his time, were of Gods juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe of their ſinnes, rather then from any want of courage and might in their king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And Jehoahaz ſlept with his fathers.]</hi> Having reigned ſeventeen years, verſ. 1. all which time Jehoaſh the ſonne of Ahaziah reigned in Judah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>In the thirty and ſeventh yeare of Joaſh king of Judah, began Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoaſh the ſonne of Jehoahaz to reigne,</hi> &amp;c.] Jehoahaz the father of Joaſh began his reigne, in the three and twentieth yeare of Joaſh king of Judah, and reigned ſeventeen years, verſ. 1. which muſt needs be till the nine and thirtieth yeare of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh king of Judah complete; and how then did his ſonne begin his reigne in the thirty ſeventh yeare of Joaſh king of Judah, as is here ſaid? I anſwer, that Joaſh was made king his father yet living, and reigned three years together with his father, but reigned not alone till the laſt; that is, the fourtieth yeare of Joaſh king of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah; and hence it is alſo, that Amaziah the ſonne of Joaſh king of Judah, is ſaid to have begun his reigne in the ſecond yeare of Joaſh ſonne of Jehoahaz king of Iſrael, chap. 14.1. either therefore becauſe Jehoahaz being wearied and broken with long adverſity, deſired to diſcharge himſelf in part of thoſe heavie cares that lay upon him; or becauſe Eliſha had perhaps foretold the victories of this his ſonne, of which we reade, verſ. 14.15. &amp;c. two years before his death he made his ſonne king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the reſt of the acts of Joaſh, and all that he did,</hi> &amp;c.] As namely the three great victories which he obtained againſt the Syrians, of which Eliſha
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:42229:307"/>
foretold him, verſ. 17, 18, 19. and his reſcuing many cities of Iſrael from the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, verſ. 25. and how he prevailed againſt Amaziah king of Judah, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the following chapter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Joaſh ſlept with his fathers.]</hi> Having reigned ſixteen years, verſ. 10. to wit, after his fathers death, beſides the three years that he reigned with his father: the firſt yeare of his ſole government, Joaſh the ſonne of Ahaziah reigned in Judah, and Amaziah his ſonne the other fifteen years.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Now Eliſha was fallen ſick, of the ſickneſſe whereof he dyed.]</hi> To wit, about five and fifty years at leaſt, as is generally thought, after Elijah was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into heaven; in which time, Jehoſhaphat, Jehoram, Ahaziah, Athaliah, and Jehoaſh ſwayed the ſcepter of Judah; and Jehoram the ſonne of Ahab, Jehu, Jehoahaz his ſonne, and Joaſh the ſonne of Jehoahaz did ſucceſſively ſit in the throne of Iſrael: yet ſome Expoſitours hold, that Joaſh his viſiting this ſick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet related in the following words, was whileſt his father Jehoahaz was yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, to wit, that when his father had ſought unto the Lord, as is ſaid before, verſ. 4. then this his ſonne Joaſh came both to viſit the ſick prophet, and to enquire concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ſad calamities that had befallen the kingdome of Iſrael: and ſo when he ſaw him in ſo weak a condition, <hi>wept over his face, and ſaid, O my father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael and the horſemen thereof;</hi> with the ſame words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Eliſha had bewailed the loſſe of Elijah, chap. 2.12. concerning which, ſee the note there. Nor is it ſtrange that this wicked king that would not be guided by the doctrine of Eliſha, ſhould yet thus paſſionately bewail the ſickneſſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, if we conſider in what a diſtreſſed condition his kingdome was at preſent, and how great things God had done for his predeceſſours the kings of Iſrael, by Eliſhaes means.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And Eliſha put his hands upon the kings hands.]</hi> The prophet putting his hands upon the kings hands when he was drawing the bowe to ſhoot, was to ſignifie, that through Gods aſſiſtance, whoſe perſon the prophet did now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he ſhould be victorious over the Syrians, according to thoſe expreſſions, Pſalm. 18.34, 35. <hi>He teacheth my hands to warre, ſo that a bowe of ſteele is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by my arms: thou haſt alſo given me the ſhield of thy ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm. 144.1. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord my ſtrength, which teacheth my hands to warre and my fingers to fight.</hi> Gen. 49.24. <hi>But his bow abode in ſtrength, and the arms of his hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And he ſaid open the window eastward,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe Syria lay eaſtward, and it was to ſignifie the vanquiſhing of the Syrians by Joaſh, that the arrow was to be ſhot out at that window.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The arrow of the Lords deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, by this arrow is ſignified, that the Lord by thy might will certainly deliver his people, and that from the Syrians, who have hitherto brought ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities upon them; and thus even that kindneſſe, which Joaſh had now ſhewen to Gods prophets was abundantly rewarded.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And he ſaid, Take the arrowes: and he took them. And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king of Iſrael, Smite upon the ground,</hi> &amp;c.] Having by the former ſigne the arrow ſhot out at the window eaſtward, foreſhewen that he ſhould vanquiſh the
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:42229:308"/>
Syrians, now by another ſigne he undertakes to ſhew him how often he ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And the man of God was wroth with him, and ſaid, Thou ſhouldeſt have ſmitten five or ſix times,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems the Lord had ſhown to Eliſha, that ſo oft as Joaſh ſhould voluntarily, after a generall charge, ſmite the earth, ſo oft ſhould Iſrael ſmite Syria; and hence was Eliſhaes anger, that he ſmote the earth no oftner: But may ſome ſay, ſeeing the Prophet did not enjoyn the king to ſmite it often, why ſhould he be angry with him for this? I anſwer, becauſe by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets explaining the meaning of his former action, to wit, his ſhooting out at the window, the king might have eaſily conceived, that even this ſecond action that was injoyned of ſmiting the earth, was alſo intended as a parabolicall ſigne of his ſmiting the Syrians, and ſo thereupon might have been eager to have given many ſtrokes to the earth. Some Expoſitours indeed give another reaſon of the Prophets anger; namely, that he was angry, not becauſe the king ſmote the ground no oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but becauſe by the kings ſmiting the earth ſo ſeldome, the Prophet foreſaw his future ſlackneſſe in purſuing the execution of Gods vengeance upon the Syrians, and the deliverance of Gods Iſrael: but the former reaſon of the Prophets anger is I conceive moſt agreeable with the words of the text: And whereas this which is here ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhouldest have ſmitten five or ſix times, then hadſt thou ſmitten Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria till thou hadſt conſumed it; whereas now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thrice,</hi> may ſeem to contradict what was ſaid before, verſ. 17. where it was abſolutely promiſed Joaſh, that he ſhould ſmite the Syrians <hi>till he had conſumed them:</hi> we muſt know, that the Prophet there ſpake onely of an utter conſuming thoſe armies of the Syrians, over whom he was to obtain three memorable victories; but here he ſpeaks of an utter ruining the whole power of the kingdome of Syria in generall, which ſhould have been if he had ſmitten the earth five or ſix times, but now ſhould not be.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And it came to paſſe as they were burying a man, that behold, they ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a band of men, and they caſt the man into the ſepulchre of Eliſha,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, that as they were going to bury a dead man, they ſpied a band of Moabites that were broken into their land, to rob and ſpoil their countrey, and ſo not having time to carry him to the place prepared for his buriall, they removed the ſtone that covered Eliſhaes ſepulchre, and caſt him in there; whereupon the dead man revived ſo ſoon as he touched the bones of Eliſha, and ſtood up upon his feet: for we muſt not think that the ſepulchre of Eliſha lay open ſo, that in their feare they could preſently without any more ado caſt the dead man upon the bones of the Prophet: however by this ſingular miracle the Lord was pleaſed; Firſt, to teach the people that it was the mighty power of God, and not any power in Eliſha himſelf, whereby in his life time he had wrought ſo many glorious miracles: And ſecondly, to ſtrengthen the faith of Joaſh concerning thoſe victories which this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet of God had foretold him a little before his death, in that hereby he might ſee that God could as eaſily revive their dead ſtate, as he had now revived this dead man; yea and beſides, in this miracle wrought by the dead body of Eliſha, we have a lively figure of that life, which all believers doe obtain, by applying to themſelves by faith the death of Chriſt their Saviour.</p>

See the note chap. 13.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2, <hi>And reigned twenty and nine years in Jeruſalem.]</hi> Of which nine and twenty years, Joaſh reigned in Iſrael fifteen years complete, and ſomething more; (for he began his reigne the yeare before Amaziah, verſ. 1. <hi>In the ſecond yeare of Joaſh ſonne of Jehoahaz king of Iſrael, reigned Amaziah:</hi> and he reigned but ſixteen years in all, chap. 13.10. and the other, fourteen years complete, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, Jeroboam the ſonne of Joaſh reigned in Iſrael; and therefore it is twice expreſſed, that Amaziah outlived Joaſh king of Iſrael fifteen years, verſ. 17. of this chapter, and 2 Chron. 25.25.) but then may ſome ſay: if Amaziah lived but to the fifteenth yeare of Jeroboam the ſonne of Joaſh; how is it ſaid, that Azari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, or Uzziah the ſonne of this Amaziah, began his reigne in the ſeven and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yeare of Jeroboam, chap. 15.1? I anſwer; either Jeroboam was deſigned king by his father Joaſh twelve years before his death, and ſo that which was but the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeare of Jeroboams reigne, to wit, when Azariah or Uzziah was made king of Judah, is counted the ſeven and twentieth from his firſt deſignation to the crown of Iſrael; or rather Azariah or Uzziah was not fully ſeated in the kingdome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till twelve years after the death of Amaziah: ſee chap. 15.1,</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, yet not like David his father,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he did, to wit, in the beginning of his reigne, that which was for the ſubſtance of it approved of God; but he did not do it (as David did) with an upright and perfect heart, 2. Chron. 25.2. <hi>And he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart:</hi> he did that good he did, out of reſpect to men, or to his own advantage; not out of a ſincere deſire of pleaſing God: ſuch as his father was, ſuch was he; his father a while out of a reſpect to men (as long as Jehoiada lived) did that which was right, but out of a falſe hollow heart, and ſo afterward fell away to idolatry, and ſo did he.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Howbeit the high places were not taken away,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added by way of exception not to that which went immediately before, of his doing all things as Joaſh his father did, (for his father Joaſh did not take away the high places, no more then he did) but to that which is ſaid in the begining of the third verſe, that <hi>he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord;</hi> to wit, in the beginning of his reigne; for as concerning this outward conformity, which at firſt he yielded to the
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:42229:309"/>
law of God, herein he failed, that he did not ſuppreſſe that ſuperſtitious worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in the high places.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And it came to paſſe, aſſoon as the kingdome was confirmed in his hands,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems the murther of his father Joaſh. chap. 12.20, 21. was at leaſt ſo farre approved and applauded by many of the people, as the juſt judgement of God upon him for his apoſtacie to idolatry, and eſpecially for the death of Zachariah the ſonne of Jehoiada, that Amaziah at his firſt entrance upon the kingdome, thought it good policie to diſſemble his diſpleaſure, and give way to the time; and ſo fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bore a while to puniſh the traitours: but aſſoon as he perceived his government well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, and found that the conſpiratours (howſoever the deed done was applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the handy work of God) had neither any mighty partakers in their fact, nor ſtrong maintainers of their perſons; he on a ſudden called them to an account, and ſo without any tumult they were put to death.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>But the children of the murderers he ſlew not,</hi> &amp;c.] Which is noted, as one of thoſe acts wherein he carried himſelf commendably in the beginning of his reigne: he might well fear leſt the children of thoſe he now put to death, might ſeek in after times to be revenged on him, and yet he would rather hazard this, then tranſgreſſe Gods law: which enjoyned that the children ſhould not be put to death for any fault of their parents, Deut. 24.16.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>He ſlew of Edom in the valley of ſalt, ten thouſand, and took Selah by warre,</hi> &amp;c.] Of this valley of ſalt, ſee the note 2. Sam. 8.13. whether it were the happy ſucceſſe of Joaſh king of Iſrael, in his warres at this time againſt the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, that kindled in Amaziah a deſire of undertaking ſome expedition, wherein himſelf might purchaſe the like honour; or what elſe it was that firſt put Amaziah upon this invaſion of the Edomites, it is not expreſſed: ſufficient cauſe he had of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre upon them, becauſe in his grandfather Jehorams time they had rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſo continued unto this time; and therefore conſidering of what importance the reducing of them to their former ſubjection would be, he went forth againſt them, and obtained a notable victory, though he did not wholly ſubdue them: the particulars of which enterpriſe are more fully expreſſed, 2. Chron. 25.5—16. as firſt, that though upon a view taken, he found in his own kingdome three hundred thouſand ſerviceable men for the warres, yet thinking it the better way in point of policie, to wage this warre chiefly by mercenaries, he hired an hundred thouſand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble valiant men of the Iſraelites for an hundred talents of ſilver, (who were in thoſe times by reaſon of their ſucceſſefull warres againſt the Syrians, become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſouldiers) to go with him againſt the Edomites; for which being reproved by a prophet that came to him, and threatned with ill ſucceſſe, if he ſtrengthened himſelf with the help of theſe men, whom God did not love, becauſe they were idolaters, though he proſpered them in their warres againſt the cruell Syrians; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſtuck a while at the loſſe of that great ſumme of money, wherewith he had hired them, yet at length he diſmiſſed them; and they enraged hereby to revenge this high diſgrace, (as they eſteemed it) fell upon the cities of Judah in their return, and ſlew three thouſand of them, and took much ſpoil. Secondly that entring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards couragiouſly into the Edomites countrey with his own ſouldiers, he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them a notable victory, wherein he not onely ſlew of them ten thouſand,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:42229:309"/>
as is here expreſſed; but alſo took other ten thouſand priſoners, whom he threw from an high rock, that very place perhaps, which is here called <hi>Selah,</hi> or <hi>the rock:</hi> uſing it may be ſuch ſeverity againſt them, becauſe notwithſtanding this his victory, they ſtill ſtood out, and would not be reduced again under the ſubjection of the crown of Judah: &amp; thirdly, that when he returned home, beſotted by I know not what ſtrange witchcraft, he ſet up the idol-gods of the Edomites (which among the other ſpoils he had brought away) to be his gods, and worſhipped them, and burned incenſe unto them; for which being reproved by a Prophet, he would not hearken to him, but checked him for daring to meddle with him, and ſo received from the Prophet that fearfull doom, that God had determined to deſtroy him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Then Amaziah ſent meſſengers to Jehoaſh the ſonne of Jehoahaz,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Amaziah puffed up with his late victory in his warres againſt the Edomites, ſent a proud challenge to Joaſh, wherein he dared him to meet him with his beſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and give him battel: moſt probable it is, that the injurie done him by the Iſraelites, whom he had diſmiſſed when he undertook the late expedition againſt mount Seir, was the firſt occaſion that provoked him to quarrel with Joaſh, 2. Chron. 25.13. <hi>But the ſouldiers of the army which Amaziah ſent back that they ſhould not go with him to battel, fell upon the cities of Judah from Samaria,</hi> &amp;c. and that this late wrong might alſo bring old matters into queſtion; namely, the ſlaughter which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu the grandfather of this Joaſh, had made amongſt the princes of Judah; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the title which the kings of Judah had to the kingdome of the ten tribes, as well as thoſe of Judah and Benjamin, the advice which he took with his counſel, 2. Chron. 25.17. <hi>Then Amaziah king of Judah took counſel and adviſe, and ſent to Joaſh the ſonne of Jehoahaz the ſonne of Jehu, ſaying, Come, let us ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the face,</hi> ſeems to imply, that they debated amongſt them theſe juſt grounds, which he had to make warre againſt the king of Iſrael: and moſt likely it is, that theſe things were objected by him in this challenge that he ſent; but becauſe he ſent this meſſage in an inſolent manner, as one that did rather deſire to decide the buſineſſe by the ſword, then to have it otherwiſe compoſed, and to try the ſtrength and courage of the king of Iſrael in a pitched battel, therefore is this onely expreſſed, that he challenged him to meet him in the field, and give him battel face to face; for that is the meaning of theſe words, <hi>Come, let us look one another in the face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>The thiſtle that was in Lebanon, ſent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus Joaſh anſwered Amaziah by a parable; and the drift of it was to put Amaziah in mind how vain a thing it was for them that are comparatively weak, and of little ſtrength, eaſily overborn and troden down, to entertain proud and aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts concerning themſelves, as if they were above the reach of danger; and he makes the thiſtles pride in this parable, to be the deſiring of the cedars daughter for his ſonnes wife, therein to couch ſecretly an argument from the leſſe to the greater: if it were too much for the thiſtle to offer affinitie with the cedar, much more then to make warre againſt the cedar, which he would have Amaziah know was juſt his caſe; becauſe he looked upon Amaziah as a poore, weak, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible king in compariſon of himſelf, though proud and quarrelſome, he compares him to a thiſtle, the baſeſt of all ſhrubs, though full of prickles; and himſelf (who had ten of the tribes of Iſrael under his command, whereas the other had but two)
<pb n="906" facs="tcp:42229:310"/>
to a cedar, the moſt noble of all trees; onely, he compares Amaziah to a thiſtle in Lebanon, as well as himſelf to a cedar in Lebanon; becauſe Amaziah was a king as well as he: again, from the fooliſh pride in the thiſtle in ſending ſuch a meſſage, he implies how farre greater the pride and folly of Amaziah was, in ſending ſuch a challenge to him: and laſt of all, by ſhewing what became of the thiſtle, <hi>There paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle,</hi> he gives A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah to underſtand what his end would be, if he perſevered in his reſolution to make warre againſt him; to wit, that his forces would eaſily cruſh and ruine him; and indeed, the miſeries that would befall him are well compared to the treading down of a wild beaſt; becauſe warre <hi>(bellum quaſi bellua)</hi> doth uſually deſtroy and tread down all before it: and ſouldiers, as men void of all reaſon, and carried on merely with fury and brutiſh paſſions, are wont without all conſideration, in a rude and brutiſh manner, to beat, and trample down all where they come; and therefore is the time of warre called <hi>a day of trouble, and treading down,</hi> Iſa. 22.5.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 11. <hi>But Amaziah would not heare.]</hi> To wit, becauſe God would have him puniſhed for his idolatry, whereunto he was then newly fallen, upon his victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Edomites, 2. Chron. 25.20. <hi>But Amaziah would not heare, for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies; becauſe they ſought after the Gods of Edom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore Jehoaſh king of Iſrael went up,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he ſtay not till the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie brake in, and ſpoiled his countrey, but entred the kingdome of Judah, and ſo encountred with him in Beth-ſhemeſh which belonged to Judah; which is added, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was another Beth-ſhemeſh in the tribe of Naphtali, Joſh. 19.38.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Jehoaſh king of Iſrael took Amaziah,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus, in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah the ſonne of Joaſh, God did yet further revenge the death of Zachariah the ſonne of Jehoiada, who was moſt inhumanely and ungratefully murthered in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dayes, according to that which he ſaid at his death, <hi>the Lord look upon it, and require it,</hi> and withall Amaziah himſelf was ſeverely puniſhed for his Apoſtacy to idolatry upon his victory over the Edomites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And brake down the wall of Jeruſalem, from the gate of Ephraim, unto the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gate, foure hundred cubits.]</hi> Some conceive that this part of the wall was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, that the inhabitants might be rendred hereby the more fearfull to attempt any thing againſt the kingdome of Iſrael, the ſtrength of the citie being ſo farre im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; but ſuch a breach that might be ſo eaſily made up again, could be no great curb to them: others ſay that it was done at Joaſh his command, that at that breach he might enter the citie in his chariot, carrying the king before him, as in triumph; but why ſhould foure hundred cubits of the wall be beaten down that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with his chariot? more probable therefore it is, that the citie at firſt ſtanding out againſt him, he battered down that part of the wall by the north gate, which was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Ephraim, and therefore called <hi>the gate of Ephraim,</hi> and ſo took the citie by force.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And he took all the gold, and ſilver,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and hostages, and returned to Samaria.]</hi> Theſe hoſtages he took for aſſurance of their performing the conditions he had impoſed upon them; but having Jeruſalem in poſſeſſion, and their king his priſoner, why did he not ſeize upon the kingdome, and joyn the twelve tribes again
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:42229:310"/>
under his government: I anſwer, that which lately had befallen Athaliah, ſhewed plainly how conſtantly affected the people ſtood to the houſe of David, neither could he tell what forces the people abroad in the countrey might preſently raiſe againſt him; no marvell therefore though he choſe rather to go away with a certain ſpoil, then to hazard all by aiming at the crown of Judah, upon ſuch weak and uncertain terms.</p>

But better, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it is anſwered by others, that though Amaziah was ſlain in the fifteenth yeare of Jeroboam, yet his ſonne Azariah was not ſettled in the throne by the generall conſent of the people, till the ſeven and twentieth yeare of Jeroboam, when he was ſixteen years old, the foregoing twelve years either he reigned under Protectours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but foure years old when his father was ſlain; or perhaps, though he were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged king by ſome, who in thoſe troubleſome times ſtuck to him, as the heir apparent of the houſe of David; yet generally by the people he was not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged king, till ſome order was taken for the redreſſe of thoſe grievances, which had enraged them ſo farre againſt his father.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And he reigned two and fifty years in Jeruſalem.]</hi> Beſides therefore the twelve years ſpent in his minority, fifteen years more he reigned in Judah, whileſt Jeroboam the ſecond reigned in the throne of Iſrael three and twenty years, in the time of Zachariah the ſonne of Jeroboam eleven years, with Shallum and Menahem (whereof Shallum reigned but a moneth) two years with Pekahiah, and a yeare and upwards with Pekah; ſo that he lived to ſee ſix kings in the throne of Iſrael.</p>

Chron. 26.5, 15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the Lord ſmote the king, ſo that he was a leper,</hi> &amp;c.] The cauſe of this is expreſſed, 2. Chron. 26.16, &amp;c. to wit, that Uzziah or Azariah puffed up with his proſperity, would needs uſurp the Prieſts office, and went into the Temple to burn incenſe; whereupon Azariah the high Prieſt, attended with foureſcore other prieſts, went in after him, and withſtood him, and reprehended this his preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for which, whileſt he was wrath with the Prieſt, the Lord ſmote him with a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, and that in his forehead, (that every one might ſee the judgement of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him) and ſo he was preſently thruſt out of the temple. And thus becauſe his ſinne was pride and arrogance, by ſtriking him with ſuch a lothſome diſeaſe in his very face, the Lord filled his face with ſhame and confuſion, making him aſhamed to ſhew his face amongſt men; and becauſe he had ſinned with ſo much impudence, coming openly into the Temple to burn incenſe, as it were to out-face the Prieſts, therefore God ſtruck him in the forehead (where impudence is wont to ſhew it ſelf, Jer. 3.3. <hi>Thou hadſt a whores forehead, thou refuſedſt to be aſhamed:)</hi> and becauſe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Regall dignity, he would needs uſurp the Prieſts office, he was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to abide in the throne: for by reaſon of his leproſie <hi>he dwelt in a ſeverall houſe,</hi> that is, in a private dwelling where he might be ſevered, as much as was poſſible, from the ſociety of others: <hi>And Jotham the kings ſonne was over the houſe, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people of the land:</hi> that is, he lived in the kings palace, and kept his court there in ſtead of his father, whoſe place he ſupplyed, and as his Vice-roy and deputy governed the whole kingdome; wherein yet there was ſomething to mitigate the poore kings ſorrows, in the midſt of all theſe miſeries that befell him; to wit, that his ſonne did not take this advantage to depoſe his father, but was content to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the people as his ſubſtitute under him. Beſides all theſe particulars, one memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſſage we find mentioned elſewhere, that is not recorded either here, or in the book of the Chronicles, to wit, that in this kings reigne there was alſo a moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>In the thirty and eighth yeare of Azariah king of Judah, did Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah the ſonne of Jeroboam reigne over Iſrael in Samaria ſix moneths.]</hi> The firſt of the fifty years of Azariahs reigne, was the ſeven and twentieth of Jeroboams reigne: verſe 1. <hi>In the twenty and ſeventh yeare of Jeroboams, Azariah the ſonne of Amaziah king of Judah began to reigne.</hi> Jeroboam reigned in all but one and fourty years, chap. 14.23. ſo that the laſt yeare of Jeroboams reigne, was but the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth or ſixteenth of Azariahs. Now if Jeroboam died the ſixteenth yeare of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zariahs reigne, how came it to paſſe that his ſonne Zachariah began not his reigne till the eight and thirtieth yeare of Azariah, which was two and twenty years after the death of his father Jeroboam? I anſwer, Some hold that the eight and thirtieth of Azariah here ſpoken on, was the eight and thirtieth from the time he began to reigne with his father Amaziah: but rather, however it ſeems upon the death of Jeroboam, Zachariah found a party that ſtuck to him, to whom the crown of right did belong, and ſo the text ſpeaks of his immediate ſucceeding his father, chap. 14.29. <hi>And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam ſlept with his fathers, and Zachariah his ſonne reigned in his ſtead:</hi> yet two or three and twentie years did paſſe before he was by uniform conſent received as king; whether it were the ambition of Jeroboams captains, each ſtriving to keep what he held for himſelf; or ſome generall diſlike taken both by Prince and people againſt Zachariah, though he were the ſonne of ſo deſerving a father; yet they would not ſtoop to his government, till at length wearied with diſſention, they were in a manner forced unto it, which was (as is here ſaid) in the thirty eighth yeare of Azariahs reigne, after which time that he was by generall conſent ſettled in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he enjoyed it onely ſix moneths.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>This was the word of the Lord which he ſpake to Jehu,</hi> &amp;c.] For Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah was in the fourth deſcent from Jehu. See the note, chap. 10.30.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Then Menahem ſmote Tiphſah,</hi> &amp;c.] Many Expoſitours take this Tiphſah, to be that mentioned 1 Kings 4.24. but becauſe that was upon the frontiers of Syria, as is evident, becauſe it is there ſaid of Solomon, <hi>that he had dominion over all the region on this ſide the river, from Tiphſah even unto Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah:</hi> and this was not farre from Tirzah, (which was in the heart of the countrey, and therefore the royall citie of the kings of Iſrael before Samaria) as is here clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implyed, in that it is ſaid, that Menahem ſmote all the coaſt of Tiphſah, from Tirzah, that is as farre as Tirzah; therefore I conceive that this was ſome other Tiphſah that was not farre from Tirzah. The cauſe why Menahem ſmote this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is here ſaid to be, <hi>becauſe they opened not to him;</hi> it ſeems they refuſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for their king, and would not open their gates to receive him; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being enraged againſt them, like a true tyrant, to make the other cities afraid to follow their example, he ſmote not onely the city, but all the coaſts about it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the inhabitants, and exerciſing therein all kind of crueltie, as appears by the particular inſtance here given: all the women therein that were with child he ript up:</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And Pull the king of Aſſyria came againſt the land,</hi> &amp;c.] This was the firſt Babylonian Monarch, called in other writers Beloſus, and Phul-Beloſus. The Aſſyrians had hitherto been the great Monarchs of the world: but this Pull or Beloſus joyning with Arbaces the Mede, beſieged Sardanapalus the laſt of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian Monarchs, an effeminate prince, and hated of all his ſubjects, untill at laſt after two years ſiege in deſpair he burnt himſelf: and thereupon his Monarchy was divided, Arbaces taking to himſelf the Empire of the Medes and Perſians, and Pull or Beloſus the Empire of Babylon and Aſſyria, and therefore called himſelf the king of Aſſyria, and this was he that now invaded the land of Iſrael; and though the cauſe of the invaſion be not here expreſſed, yet moſt likely it is, that by the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians and Syrians from whom Jeroboam the ſecond had taken much (chap. 14.28. <hi>He recovered Damaſcus and Hamath,</hi> &amp;c.) he was now called in to invade the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael, when it had been many years together weakened by thoſe civill and inteſtine broiles before mentioned that were in the land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Menahem gave Pull a thouſand talents of ſilver, that his hand might be with them,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he not onely purchaſed his peace with the Aſſyrian king by that gift, but alſo procured a promiſe of his aid upon all occaſions, for the eſtabliſhment of his kingdome; whereby it is evident, that though he had uſurped the kingdome, yet he enjoyed it not without oppoſition.</p>

Chron. 5.26. and was doubtleſſe the ſonne of Pull king of Aſſyria, that had not many years before invaded the land in the dayes of Menahem, verſ. 19. and therefore called Tiglath-pull-aſſir: the cauſe why he now came into the land of Iſrael is expreſſed elſewhere, though it be not mentioned here: it ſeems this Pekah king of Iſrael combined with Rezin king of Syria, againſt Ahaz king of Judah, and did firſt ſeverally invade his land, and ſorely oppreſſed him, and then afterwards joyntly went up to beſiege Ahaz king of Judah in Jeruſalem; whereupon Ahaz being at the ſame time invaded alſo in other parts of his kingdomes, by other neighbouring nations, ſent to this great king of Aſſyria, to deſire his help againſt theſe two kings, as is expreſſed in the following chapter, verſ. 7. <hi>So Ahaz ſent meſſengers to Tiglath-pileſer king of Aſſyria, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am thy ſervant and thy ſonne, come up and ſave me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Iſrael, which riſe up against me;</hi> and thereupon he came as he deſired into the land of Iſrael (the rather happely, becauſe this Pekah had ſlain the ſonne of Menahem, whom his father Pull had ſettled in the kingdome of Iſrael, as is before noted) and ſo took the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places here mentioned in the kingdome of Iſrael; to wit, <hi>Ijon, and Abel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-maachah, and Janoah,</hi> a town belonging to Ephraim, Joſh. 16.6. <hi>and Kedeſh, and Hazer</hi> cities of Napthali, Joſh. 19.36, 37. <hi>and Gilead,</hi> that is, all the land without Jordan, where the Rubenites, and Gadites, and half tribe of Manaſſeh had their poſſeſſions, and <hi>Galilee, all the land of Napthali, and carried them captive to Aſſyria:</hi> ſo that indeed at this time he ſubdued in a manner five tribes of Iſrael; to wit, thoſe without Jordan (who as they had firſt their inheritance given them, ſo they were now firſt carried away captives) and the tribes of Zebulon and Napthali who were ſeated in the land of Galilee. And this was the firſt captivity of Iſrael. Neither do we ever reade that theſe that were now carried away, or their poſterity did ever return again into the land of Iſrael, as thoſe of Judah did, that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried into Babilon; whence it is, that when the prophet Iſaiah threatned the Jewes with the captivity of Babilon, he added this as a comfort, that their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſhould not be ſuch as when their brethren of Iſrael, were carryed captive into Aſſyria, Iſa. 9.1. <hi>Nevertheleſſe the dimneſſe ſhall not be ſuch as was in her vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when at the firſt he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulon, and the land of Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali, and afterwards did more grievouſly afflict her, by the way of the ſea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And Hoſhea the ſonne of Elah, made a conſpiracie against Pekah,</hi> &amp;c.] Doubtleſſe the people of Iſrael were greatly enraged, becauſe ſo many of their tribes were carried away captive into Aſſyria by Tiglath-pileſer king of Aſſyria, and laid all the blame upon this their unfortunate king Pekah; partly, becauſe by making warre againſt Ahaz king of Judah cauſeleſſely, he had provoked Ahaz to call in the Aſſyrians to his help; and partly becauſe he got the kingdome by ſlaying Pekahiah, the ſonne of Menahem, whom the Aſſyrian king had ſettled in the throne of Iſrael. Now being thus fallen under the contempt and hatred of his people, it is no wonder that Hoſhea ſhould find enow that would joyn with him in a conſpiracy to kill him, which accordingly they accompliſhed, and ſo the Lord cut him off by a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy

But to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe ſeeming contradictions, we muſt know that Jotham lived twenty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was ſettled in the throne of Judah, upon the death of his father Uzziah, but that foure years before he died, he wholly reſigned his kingdome to his ſonne Ahaz; and ſo it was in the fourth yeare of Ahaz when Hoſhea ſlew Pekah, and took upon himſelf the title of king of Iſrael; but this fourth yeare of Ahaz, is called the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of Jotham, becauſe Jotham had ſtill the title of king, though he had foure years before reſigned his kingdome to his ſonne Ahaz.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>In the ſecond yeare of Pekah the ſonne of Remaliah king of Iſrael, began Jotham,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, after his father Uzziahs death (for he had the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the kingdome under his father a long time before this; to wit, ever ſince his father became a leper, as is noted verſe 5.) About this time therefore did the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſaiah ſee that glorious viſion, Iſa. 6.1. <hi>In the yeare that king Uzziah died, I ſaw alſo the Lord ſitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple,</hi> &amp;c. and in this kings reigne Hoſea and Micah propheſied to the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reigne, and he reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſixteen years,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Expoſitours conceive, that he was thus old when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reign in his fathers life-time; which they hold, thereby to reſolve that great difficulty concerning the age of his grand-child Hezekiah, when he began to reigne; of which ſee the note chap. 18.2. But I rather think it muſt be underſtood (for ſo the words ſeem clearly to import) of his age when he began his ſixteen years reigne, which was after his fathers death; to wit, to the ſeventeenth yeare of Pekah, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in the firſt verſe of the following chapter: <hi>In the ſeventeenth yeare of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah the ſonne of Remaliah, Ahaz the ſonne of Jotham king of Judah began to reigne.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>And he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] This is more fully expreſſed, 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reigne, and he reigned ſixteen years,</hi> &amp;c.] If Ahaz was twenty years old when he began his reigne, when he died, ſixteen years after, he was but thirty ſix years old, and then was Hezekiah his ſonne twenty five years old, chap. 18.2. <hi>Twenty and five years old was Hezekiah when he began to reigne, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jeruſalem:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may ſeem that Hezekiah was born to Ahaz, when he was yet but ten or eleven years old; which (ſay ſome Expoſitours) we need not wonder at, conſidering the ſingular bleſſing that nation had for generation: but becauſe it is very unlikely that the Jews had children ſo young, therefore other Expoſitours do anſwer this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two other wayes; to wit, firſt, that Ahaz was twenty years old when <hi>he</hi> (that is, <hi>Jotham his father</hi>) of whom he had ſpoken in the former verſe, <hi>began to reigne,</hi> to wit, after the death of his father Uzziah: or ſecondly, (and I think thus it is better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) that Ahaz began to reigne when he was firſt deſigned king in the life of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham his father, and then he was but twenty years old; and the like muſt then be ſaid of Jotham too, chap. 15.30. but when after his fathers death he began to reigne as abſolute king himſelf (from which theſe ſixteen years muſt be reckoned) he might be twenty five or twenty ſix years old, or perhaps more.</p>

But the Ahaz did indeed burn his ſonnes, at leaſt ſome one of his ſonnes, as by way of ſacrificing them to his idol-gods, is evident 2.

Firſt, they each invaded the land ſeverally, as is related in the Chronicles, and both of them prevailed againſt Ahaz, and exceedingly weakened and ſpoiled his countrey: for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin carried away many of the people captives to Damaſcus, and Pekah ſlew in one day one hundred and twenty thouſand of them, (amongſt whom was <hi>Maaſeiah the kings ſonne</hi> (he ſacrificed one ſonne to his idol-gods, and now another was ſlain by the ſword of his enemies) <hi>and Azrikam the governour of his houſe, and Elkanah the ſecond perſon to the king:</hi> who were ſlain by Zichri a mighty man of Ephraim, and carried away alſo two hundred thouſand priſoners, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; though indeed by the counſel of the prophet Oded, they were returned and delivered back again, 2.

For again the Edomites had come and and ſmitten Judah, and carried away captives.

                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>The king of Aſſyria went up againſt Damaſcus, and took it,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Rezin and Pekah were gone from the ſiege of Jeruſalem, before the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians came to help Ahaz; yet when he came he invaded the land of Iſrael, where what havock he made, we heard before chap. 15.29. <hi>In the dayes of Pekah king of Iſrael, came Tiglath-pileſer king of Aſſyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chah, and Janoah, and Ked<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And king Ahaz went to Damaſcus to meet Tiglath-pileſer king of Aſſyria.]</hi> To wit, to congratulate his ſucceſſe in taking Damaſcus, doubtleſſe he was highly pleaſed with ſeeing his enemies that had lately beſieged him in Jeruſalem, brought on a ſudden ſo low; Rezin being ſlain, and his kingdome quite loſt, and the king of Iſrael extremely weakened, and brought into contempt amongſt his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by the carrying away of five tribes of Iſrael captives into Aſſyria: and it is very likely, that he triumphed in the ſucceſſe of his own counſels, in ſending for the king of Aſſyria, contrary to what the prophet Iſaiah had adviſed, Iſaiah 7.4. little thinking that within a few years that very nation, in whoſe victories he now triumphed, ſhould utterly ruine the kingdome of Judah, as they had done other kingdomes; of which it ſeems, the prophet Iſaiah gave Ahaz warning, Iſaiah 7.17.

                     <hi>And ſaw an altar that was at Damaſcus: and king Ahaz ſent to Urijah the prieſt the faſhion of the altar,</hi> &amp;c.] What moved him to this is expreſſed in the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, 2. Chron. 28.23. <hi>For he ſacrificed unto the gods of Damaſcus, which ſmote him: and he ſaid, Becauſe the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I ſacrifice to them, that they may help me; but they were the ruine of him, and of all Iſrael:</hi> and becauſe he did this alſo at a time when God had ſo heavily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him, his ſinne was the more grievous; as it is there noted, verſ. 22. <hi>And in the time of his diſtreſſe, did he treſpaſſe yet more against the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Urijah the prieſt built an Altar according to all that king Ahaz had ſent from Damaſcus,</hi> &amp;c.] Though hitherto this Urijah had maintained the true worſhip of God in the Temple, and was not long before this choſen by the prophet Iſaiah as a witneſſe of his propheſie, which he faſtned upon the doores of the Temple, Iſaiah 8.1, 2. yet now he turned Apoſtate and yeilded preſently to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this wicked command of Ahaz.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12: <hi>And the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.]</hi> To wit, to the gods of Aſſyria, 2. Chron. 28.23. <hi>He ſacrificed unto the gods of Damaſcus, which ſmote him: and he ſaid, Becauſe the gods of the kings of Syria,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And king Ahaz commanded <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah the prieſt, ſaying, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, upon his new altar, which it ſeems was greater then Solomons altar; or elſe more highly eſteemed by him, and therefore ſo called: yet that it was not of braſſe, we may probably conceive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the foregoing verſe, Solomons altar is diſtinguiſhed from this new altar, by the name of the braſen altar.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>IN the twelfth yeare of Ahaz king of Judah, began Hoſhea the ſonne of Elah to reigne,</hi> &amp;c.] It is manifeſt that Hoſhea the laſt king of Iſrael, ſlew Pekah in the twentieth yeare of Jotham, and that then he aſſumed to himſelf the title of king of Iſrael, chap. 15.30. <hi>And Hoſhea the ſonne of Elah made a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie against Pekah the ſonne of Remaliah, and ſlew him in the twentieth yeare of Jotham the ſonne of Uzziah:</hi> and as manifeſt it is, that the yeare which is there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the twentieth of Jotham, was the fourth of Ahaz his ſonne (for Jotham reigned but ſixteen years, chap. 15.33. <hi>Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reigne, and he reigned ſixteen years in Jeruſalem.</hi> Now if Hoſhea ſucceeded Pekah in the kingdome of Iſrael, in the fourth yeare of Ahaz, how is it here ſaid that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reigne in Samaria in the twelfth yeare of Ahaz; ſurely, becauſe though he thruſt himſelf into the kingdome, yet he was not acknowledged king, but oppoſed as an uſurper; and that perhaps not onely by the Iſraelites, but alſo by the king of Aſſyria, who in the latter end of Pekahs reigne, had (upon the perſwaſion of Ahaz) entred into the land of Iſrael, and ſeized upon a great part of the kingdome, chap. 15.29. and thus the kingdome of Iſrael was in a manner unſettled, untill the twelfth yeare of Ahaz his reigne, when either by the people, or by the Aſſyrian king, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhea had, it ſeems, the crown of Iſrael confirmed to him; and ſo he reigned, as it is ſaid here, nine years: for after the twelfth yeare of Ahaz his reigne (which muſt not be reckoned, becauſe it was well nigh ended ere Hoſhea was eſtabliſhed king) there are foure years of Ahaz his reigne remaining (for he reigned ſixteen years, chap. 16.2.) and five years of Hezekiahs reigne, which makes nine years. Indeed chap. 18.1. it is ſaid, <hi>Hezekiah began to reigne in the third yeare of Hoſhea:</hi> but of that ſee the note there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And he did that which was evil in the ſight of the Lord, but not as the kings of Iſrael that were before him.]</hi> To wit, becauſe though he continued the idolatry of Jeroboam, yet he abandoned the groſſer idolatries of many kings that had

been before him; and then beſides he ſuffered ſuch of his ſubjects as would, to go up to worſhip in the Temple of Jeruſalem, which the former kings of Iſrael would not permit: this we find, 2. Chron. 30.11. &amp;c. where it is ſaid, that when Hezekiah had proclaimed a ſolemne paſſeover, many of the ten tribes went up to keep the paſſeover in Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Againſt him came up Shalmaneſer king of Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.] When Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhea had ſlain Pekah in the fourth yeare of Ahaz, as is before noted, he found not ſo ready admittance into his throne, as perhaps he expected; and whileſt the people were in this combuſtion amongſt themſelves, Shalmaneſer (called by others Nabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſar) the ſonne of Tiglath-pilezer, being either deſired to come into the aid of that party that oppoſed Hoſhea; or being of himſelf ready enough to take advantage of theſe civil broils, that he might wholly ſubdue that kingdome which his father had already in a great part ruined; he came up againſt Hoſhea, and at length prevailed ſo farre, that Hoſhea was content to become his ſervant, and to pay him tribute: and ſo was ſettled in the throne of Iſrael, which was (as is probable) in the twelfth yeare of Ahaz, as is above noted, verſ. 1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the king of Aſſyria found conſpiracie in Hoſhea,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Shalmaneſer the Aſſyrian king, diſcovered that Hoſhea had practiſed with <hi>So</hi> king of Egypt, to wit, that Hoſhea ſhould caſt off the yoke of the Aſſyrian king, and that he ſhould be ſupported herein with ſuccour from Egypt; and this he firſt ſuſpected, by hearing that Hoſhea had ſent ambaſſadours to the king of Egypt, and then was confirmed in his ſuſpicion, when he found that Hoſhea neglected to pay the tribute, which formerly he had yearely paid: this <hi>So</hi> is thought to be the ſame that by other Hiſtorians is called Sua or Sabucus the Ethiopian, becauſe in Ethiopia he had his education: the encroaching power of the Aſſyrian might be well terrible to Egyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reigne, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jeruſalem.]</hi> If we compare this place with chap. 16.2. where it is ſaid that Ahaz Hezekiahs father was twenty years old when he began to reigne, and that he reigned ſixteen years, and conſequently was thirty ſix years old when he dyed; it may ſeem that Ahaz begat Hezekiah when he was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above eleven years old: for if Hezekiah was five and twenty years old when his father was but thirty ſix, it muſt neceſſarily follow that Ahaz was but eleven years old when his ſonne Hezekiah was born: to avoid this inconvenience ſome
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:42229:319"/>
hold that Ahaz was one and twenty years old, or nigh ſo much, when he began to reigne, the incomplete yeare not being reckoned, chap. 16.2. the like alſo they ſay concerning the years of his reigne, to wit, that he reigned ſeventeen years well nigh complete, and ſo was thirty eight years old when he died; on the other ſide they ſay that Hezekiah was but twenty foure years old when he began to reigne; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was foure and twenty years old complete, and ſomething more, it is here ſaid, that he was five and twenty years old when he began to reigne. Now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this computation Ahaz being thirty eight eight years old when he died, and Hezekiah twenty foure, it will follow that Ahaz was fourteen years old when He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah his ſonne was born, which, ſay they, was poſſible enough; but becauſe we find elſewhere that it was ſo uſuall with the kings of Judah and Iſrael, to cauſe their ſonnes that were to ſucceed them to be deſigned kings in their life; I ſhould rather conceive, that what is ſaid both of Ahaz and Hezekiah, concerning their age when they began to reigne, is meant of the time when they were firſt deſigned kings, as is before noted, chap. 16.2.</p>

Chron. 29.1. and if ſhe were, as is ſuppoſed by many, the daughter of that Zachariah, by whom ſo long as he lived Uzziah was kept in the way of truth, chap. 26.5. we may well think that her piety, manifeſted in the carefull education of this her ſonne, was a chief means under God that he proved ſo zealous for the cauſe of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though his father was ſo extremely wicked.</p>

Secondly, that having called together the prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, he exhorted them to ſanctifie themſelves, and to cleanſe the houſe of God, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to conſider that all the calamities which had lately fallen upon them, were for thoſe foul corruptions in Religion which were crept in amongſt them, and that this the prieſts and Levites did carefully, as he enjoyned them; and ſo the king, with the rulers of the citie, came up immediately to the Temple, and offered ſacrifices there in a moſt ſolemne manner unto the Lord. Thirdly, that upon advice taken, becauſe they could not keep the paſſeover at the uſuall time, they reſolved to keep it on the fourteenth day of the ſecond moneth, to this end proclamation was made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdome for the aſſembly of the people; yea the king ſent poſts with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Iſraelites of the ten tribes, to perſwade them alſo to return unto the Lord, and to come up unto Jeruſalem to keep the paſſeover, and the feaſt of unleavened bread; wherein he prevailed with divers of them (though the moſt of them laughed his meſſengers to ſcorn) and ſo there was a great aſſembly both of the men of Judah and Iſrael, in Jeruſalem, where they kept the feaſt with exceeding great joy: at which time it was that the people by the kings encouragement beginning firſt in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and afterward procceeding to the other cities of Judah, yea, and to ſome cities of the Iſraelites too, brake down all the idols and their appurtenance, as is here relalated; yea, and removed the high places too, which had hitherto ſtood in the dayes of their beſt king. And fourthly, that he ordered the courſes of the prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,

But how did he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell all that were after him? ſeeing of Joſiah his grandchild it is ſaid, chap. 23.25. <hi>that there was no king before him like unto him?</hi> I anſwer; this needs not ſeem ſtrange, if we conſider, that though Joſiah might excell him in ſome things, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did; yet Hezekiah might excell Joſiah in other things: as firſt, in that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah was the firſt that removed the high places, though none before him had done it, yet he would not ſuffer them to ſtand; but when Joſiah removed the high places, he had the example of this his good grandfather to encourage him: and ſecondly, in his many victories over the Philiſtines, wherein Joſiah was never ſo ſucceſſefull.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>Am I now come up without the Lord againſt this place to deſtroy it?</hi> &amp;c.] This Rabſhakeh might ſpeak onely to terrifie the people, though in truth he had never any ſuch thought concerning the all-ruling providence of God; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides having heard of Hezekiahs taking away the high places and altars, whereon for many years together the people had worſhipped the God of Iſrael, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf that this marvellous ſucceſſe, which the Aſſyrians had had in their warres againſt Judah, proceeded from the wrath of the God of Iſrael againſt his people; and ſo urgeth them with this, that doubtleſſe their own God had brought his maſter againſt them, to puniſh them for this which Hezekiah had done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Then ſaid Eliakim the ſonne of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, one of them in the name of them all: though theſe three men came out to parley with Rabſhaketh and the other Aſſyrian captains, yet it ſeems Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaketh when he ſpake to them, ſpake ſo loud, and that in the Jewes language, that all the ſouldiers that were on the wall might heare what he ſaid; which he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to affright the people, as is expreſſely noted, 2. Chron. 32.18. <hi>Then they cryed with a loud voice in the Jews speech unto the people of Jeruſalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them, that they might take the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> Eliakim therefore, and thoſe that were with him, deſired Rabſhaketh to ſpeak in the Syrian and not in the Jews language, <hi>Speak I pray thee to thy ſervants in the Syrian language (for we understand it) and talk not with us in the Jews language, in the eares of the people that are on the wall:</hi> a ſtrange requeſt indeed this may ſeeme, to be made to an enemy, who they might be ſure would do what he could to diſcourage the people, and to raiſe ſedition amongſt them: but firſt, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that men in danger ſhould ſeek to help themſelves in thoſe wayes, whereby there is little or no likelyhood that they ſhould do themſelves any good: and ſecondly, perhaps they deſired this of him as refuſing to continue the parley, unleſſe he would ſpeak to them in the Syrian language; upon which ground they might conceive

he would yeild to them, as hoping that upon this parley they would ſurrender the citie to him peaceably.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>THis is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blaſphemy.]</hi> That is, this is a day wherein the poore people of God are in great trouble, wherein the Lord hath teſtified his diſpleaſure againſt us, and rebuked us for our ſinnes, and wherein the proud enemy hath blaſphemed Gods name.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Behold, I will ſend a blaſt upon him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I will drive him out of the kingdome, even as the duſt or chaffe is driven by a blaſt of wind; and thus the Lord ſhews how unable the Aſſyrian ſhould be to ſtand againſt his indignation not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he thought his power could not be reſiſted. What this blaſt was wherewith the Aſſyrian was driven out of the land, may be probably gathered by that which is related afterward: it may be meant either of the report of the king of Ethiopia's arming againſt him, or of the ſlaughter which was made by the Angel in his army, verſ. 35. or of the fear and terrour wherewith he was ſtricken of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe occaſions, or of all theſe together: and ſo likewiſe for the rumour that is mentioned in the next words, <hi>and he ſhall heare a rumour,</hi> &amp;c. it may be mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> both of the rumour that the king of Ethiopia was come out againſt him, verſ. 9. and of the rumour of the ſlaughter made in the Aſſyrian army, perhaps the tumult, and ſhreeking, and grones that were then amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>So Rabſhakeh returned, and found the king of Aſſyria warring against Libnah.]</hi> Rabſhakeh finding that the inhabitants of Jeruſalem would not yield to open their gates unto him, went preſently to Sennacherib to Libnah; either to inform him of their reſolution, or rather to conferre with him concerning the army of Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hakah the Arabian, or Ethiopian king, whereof it ſeems he had heard. Whether he raiſed the ſiege, and went away with that army he carried againſt Jeruſalem, chap. 18.17. it is not expreſſed. The threatning letters which Sennacherib immediately ſent to Hezekiah, by terrifying him to make him yield, is a probable argument that Rabſhakeh had left his army ſtill before Jeruſalem, under the command of the other captains, and onely went himſelf to Sennacherib, to conſult with him concerning their affairs.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And when he heard ſay of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to ſight againſt thee: he ſent meſſengers again unto Hezekiah.]</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he gave them letters written to Hezekiah, containing in effect the ſame meſſage, verſ. 14. and the reaſon why he thus ſought by all means to terrifie Hezekiah, was to make him yield preſently to him, that if it were poſſible he might be poſſeſſed of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, before they ſhould heare of the coming of the Ethiopian army; and that the rather, becauſe that citie would be the moſt convenient place for him to retreat unto with his army, if need were to ſhelter themſelves againſt the Ethiopians.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And Hezekiah went up into the houſe of the Lord, and ſpread it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.]</hi> That is, he ſpread Sennacheribs letter before the altar, the ſigne of Gods preſence amongſt them; and this he did, partly, to quicken his own ſpirit, and to ſtrengthen his own faith in prayer, by the ſight of that blaſphemous writing; and partly, by that outward ſigne, to imply what he deſired of God; namely, that God would take notice of, and revenge the horrible blaſphemies of that daring wretch, againſt his great and glorious name.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And heare the words of Sennacherib, which hath ſent him to reproch the living God.]</hi> That is, the meſſenger that brought his letter.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>I have digged and drunk ſtrange waters, and with the ſole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of beſieged places.]</hi> That is, when I have come in places moſt deſtitute of water, it hath been no hindrance to me, becauſe even there I have digged up <hi>ſtrange waters,</hi> that is, fountains, &amp; waters, where never any were ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; &amp; on the other ſide where cities have been environed with great &amp; deep waters, no ſooner have I ſet my foot there to beſiege them, but with the multitude of my ſouldiers I have dried them up. Thus he boaſts, that nothing could be a let to his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army, and laughs to ſcorn Hezekiahs policie in cutting of the waters, 2. Chron. 32.3.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Therefore their inhabitants were of ſmall power, they were diſmaied and confounded, they were as the graſſe of the field,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, becauſe I gave them up into thy power, therefore they were ſoon and eaſily deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>But I know thy abode, and thy going out,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I know all thy counſels and enterprizes; there is nothing thou doeſt adviſe upon, or determine, nothing thou doeſt attempt or accompliſh, but it is known to me; yea, thou doeſt nothing but what I have determined ſhall be done: and this is fully that which David acknowledgeth concerning himſelf, Pſalm. 139.2, 3. <hi>Thou knoweſt my down ſitting and mine upriſing, thou underſtandest my thoughts afarre off, thou compaſſeſt my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And this ſhall be a ſigne unto thee, Ye ſhall eat this yeare ſuch things as grow of themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though ye have been hindred from ſowing and planting this yeare, by reaſon of the Aſſyrians that have invaded your land; yea, though there be no ſowing nor planting the next yeare, (to wit, either becauſe it was the ſabbath yeare, the yeare of the lands reſt; or becauſe the Aſſyrians left not the countrey till ſeed time was paſt) yet there ſhall be ſufficient that ſhall grow of it ſelf of the ſcattered ſeeds of corne that fell upon the earth; and hereby ſome inferre, that the Aſſyrians continued a time in the land, even after this promiſe was made to Hezekiah by the prophet Iſaiah, at leaſt, till the ſeed time of the ſecond yeare was paſt: and a very miraculous paſſage this was, that for three years they ſhould live of that which grew of it ſelf; nor is it any wonder that the Lord gives
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:42229:323"/>
that for a ſigne to ſtrengthen their faith, which was not accompliſhed till the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians had left the land: we ſee the like Exod. 3.12. <hi>And he ſaid, Certainly I will be with thee, and this ſhall be a token unto thee, that I have ſent thee, when thou haſt brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye ſhall ſerve God upon this mountain.</hi> (Concerning which, ſee the note there.)</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>For out of Jeruſalem ſhall go forth a remnant, and they that eſcape out of mount Zion.]</hi> That is, that poore remnant that now for fear of the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, is ſhut up within the walls of Jeruſalem, ſhall go forth thence (the enemies being fled) and ſhall again repleniſh the land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The zeal of the Lord of hosts ſhall do this.]</hi> The Lords zeal for his own glory, the fervent love he beares to his people, and his juſt indignation againſt the enemy, ſhall move him to do this, however his people have deſerved no ſuch favour at his hands.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>He ſhall not come into this citie, nor ſhoot an arrow there,</hi> &amp;c.] It is evident that Rabſhaketh came up againſt Jeruſalem with a great army, chap. 18.17. if he removed his army thence when he went to Sennacherib to Libnah, verſ. 8. (which perhaps he did, having heard of the Ethiopian that was coming againſt them) then the meaning of this place is clear, that notwithſtanding the threatning letters he had ſent, he ſhould not return again to lay ſiege unto Jeruſalem; but if the army of Rabſhakeh lay ſtill before Jeruſalem, then the meaning of theſe words may be, that though the army of Rabſhakeh had blockt up Jeruſalem, and waited for the coming of Sennacheribs army, who was happely gone againſt the Egyptian and Ethiopian army, intending then with their joynt forces to aſſault Jeruſalem; yet he ſhould never caſt a bank againſt it, but ſhould return the way he came, which accordingly came to paſſe, verſ. 35. as was formerly prophecyed by Iſaiah, chap. 14.25. <hi>I will break the Aſsyrian in my land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon my mountains tread him under foot; then ſhall his yoke depart from off them, and his burthen depart from off their ſhoulder.</hi>

He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah had not yet a ſonne to ſucceed him in the throne, for Manaſſeh was borne three years after this, as being but twelve years old at his fathers death, chap. 21.1. and therefore it is probable, that this was one chief thing which Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah had reſpect to in theſe words, that he ſhould adviſe and determine what was requiſite concerning his ſucceſſour, for (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt dye and not live,</hi> that is, thou art but a dead man by the ordinary courſe of nature; there is no way of recovery for thee, unleſſe the Lord ſhall be pleaſed by his almighty power to deliver thee: it is true indeed, this condition was not expreſſed, yet was it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; the Lord purpoſely (or elſe where) concealing this part of his will, that Hezekiah receiving the ſentence of death in himſelf, might the more earneſtly ſeek for help unto the Lord: and that Hezekiah took it for a conditionall threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not a declaration of what God had abſolutely determined, is evident by his praying to God for mercy herein.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:42229:324"/>
that wall was towards the Temple, or rather to hide his tears, and that being thereby the freer from diſtractions, he might the more freely poure forth his requeſts unto God, to whom he now turned, as to his onely hope and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>I beſeech thee, O Lord, remember now, how I have walked before thee in truth,</hi> &amp;c.] Beſides that love of life, and horrour of death, which is naturally in all men, and which grace hath much adoe to overmaſter, even in the beſt of Gods ſervants, there were many things that made the ſentence of death in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner terrible to Hezekiah: as firſt, becauſe he had yet no ſonne to ſucceed him in the throne, chap. 21.1. and it muſt needs be very grievous to him to think that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to David and Solomon, 1. Kings 8.25. <hi>There ſhall not fail thee a man in my ſight, to ſit on the throne of Iſrael,</hi> ſhould not be made good to him in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, who had to his utmoſt endeavoured to keep the condition required of God at the giving of that promiſe: Secondly, becauſe he could not but fear, leſt upon his death Religion would go to wrack again, leſt the reformation newly begun, would ſoon come to nothing, and the poore Church of God would quickly be overgrown with ſuperſtition again: Thirdly, becauſe he ſaw that thoſe that had been already forward enough to aſcribe all the calamities that had befallen the kingdome in his time, to his ſuppreſſing their high places, altars, and idols, would be now much more bold to inſult over him, if God ſhould thus ſuddenly cut him off: And fourthly, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe his own faith muſt needs be ſorely aſſaulted, and ſhaken with theſe temptations, and that the rather, becauſe the coming of the Prophet to him in ſuch a manner, as Gods Herald, to threaten him with death, <hi>Thou ſhalt die, and not live,</hi> might ſeem to imply, that God meant to hew him down in diſpleaſure: doubtleſſe, in theſe regards the heart of Hezekiah was almoſt overwhelmed with terrours; (as himſelf afterward expreſſed in his ſong, Iſa. 38.10.—14.) and hence it is, that in this his prayer he pleads his integritie, that what he had done in the reformation of his kingdome, he had done with an upright heart, becauſe he knew it was good in his eyes; not by way of expoſtulation or pleading his merits, but to ſupport and ſtrengthen his faith againſt theſe temptations, that he might with the more hope and confidence call upon God, and might by this argument move the Lord to ſhew him mercy.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And it came to paſſe afore Iſaiah was gone out into the middle court,</hi> &amp;c.] Some reade this, <hi>afore Iſaiah was gone out into the middle citie:</hi> and indeed it is by many held, that Jeruſalem was divided into three parts; whereof one was the citie of David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is called Zion; another that which was of old called Jebus, or Salem; and a third, that which lay betwixt theſe two and joyned them together, and was called <hi>the middle citie,</hi> the ſame where Huldah the propheteſſe dwelt, chap. 22.14. for ſo ſome reade that place, <hi>ſhe dwelt in Jeruſalem in the ſecond part,</hi> and accordingly they underſtand this place that before the Prophet was gone out of the citie of David into the middle citie, the Lord ſent him back to Hezekiah with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of recovery: but becauſe the text ſeems moſt plainly to ſpeak of the Prophets going out of the kings houſe, and the tender compaſſion of God in the ſpeedy ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of the Prophet to comfort the afflicted ſoul of Hezekiah, is the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſcovered by this, that <hi>afore Iſaiah was gone out into the middle court</hi> of the kings houſe, he was ſent back again to the king, this tranſlation is juſtly put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:42229:325"/>
the text of our Bibles, as the beſt; and this middle court I take to be the ſame which is called the court within the porch, 1. Kings 7.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer,</hi> &amp;c.] In ſending to Hezekiah the promiſe of his recovery, the Lord ſtiles himſelf the God of David his father, becauſe the promiſe made to David concerning the continued ſucceſſion of his ſeed in the throne of Judah, ſhould by this means be made good to Hezekiah, who ſhould now live to have an heir to ſucceed him; even as in former time, to imply that God would perform to the Iſraelites what he had promiſed to Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, he uſed to ſtile himſelf the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On the third day thou ſhalt go up unto the houſe of the Lord.]</hi> The ſuddenneſſe of his recovery makes it evident that it was miraculous, and the mention of his going to the houſe of the Lord, ſweetens the tidings of his recovery, ſince nothing could more glad his heart then to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And I will deliver thee, and this citie out of the hand of the king of Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Sennacherib were returned (as is moſt probable) into his own countrey: yet, firſt, there might be ſome garriſons left behind here and there in the cities he had taken: and ſecondly, juſt cauſe had Hezekiah to fear, that having reinforced his army, he would return again, and endeavour to wipe of the ſtain of his preſent flight; and to remove thoſe fears, the Lord aſſures him, that as he had, ſo he would ſtill deliver both him and Jeruſalem out of the hand of the Aſſyrian.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And Iſaiah ſaid, Take a lump of dry figges,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, a maſſe made of drie figges. Both the boil that Hezekiah had in this dangerous ſickneſſe, and the maſſe of figges appointed to be laid to the boil, which are ordinarily uſed for the ripening of ſuch hard, purulent, peſtilentiall tumours, make it very probable it was the plague, whereof Hezekiah was now ſick; and though therefore the medicine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed was proper for the cure in a naturall way; yet if we conſider how ſpeedie the cure was, we may well think that there was a miraculous and ſupernaturall virtue added of God, to haſten the operation of theſe naturall means.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And Hezekiah ſaid unto Iſaiah, What ſhall be the ſigne that the Lord will heal me?</hi> &amp;c,] Not becauſe he believed not, did Hezekiah deſire this ſigne, but for the ſtrengthening of his faith; the rather, becauſe the promiſe he now made, did ſo directly contradict what he had ſaid before. See the note Judg. 6.15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ, 9. <hi>Shall the ſhadow go forward ten degrees, or go backward ten degrees?]</hi> Becauſe it is left to Hezekiahs choice, whether the ſhadow ſhould go forward, or backward ten degrees, and both are propounded, as equally miraculous, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his faith; hence I conceive it is evident, firſt, that the Prophet meant it, of the retiring, or going forward of the ſhadow ſo many degrees in an inſtant, for the leaſurely going forward of the ſhadow, would not have had any wonder in it, and could not therefore be proffered to him as a miraculous ſigne to aſſure him of his recovery: ſecondly, that the degrees that it was to go forward, or backward, were not the lines, wherewith in the dials the houres are marked out (for there could not be ten houres for it to go forward, and ten to go backward, ſince the day was never twenty houres long in the climate of Judea) but it muſt be meant of thoſe
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:42229:325"/>
leſſer lines or degrees, where with half houres, or quarter of houres are marked; yea rather I conceive it is meant of the quarters, and that becauſe this miraculous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſunne was to be obſerved in the diall of Ahaz: now had the ſunne gone backward ten houres, or five houres, it might have been as well obſerved in the motion of the ſunne; but going back no more then ten of theſe ſmaller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it could not be ſo well obſerved in the ſun it ſelf, as in the ſhadow of the diall.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Hezekiah anſwered, It is a light thing for the ſhadow to go down ten degrees,</hi> &amp;c.] The very going downward or forward of the ſunne or ſhadow ten degrees, would have been a wonderfull miracle, to wit, being done on a ſudden, or in an inſtant; yet becauſe it is naturall for the ſunne or ſhadow to go forward, though it had removed farre faſter away forward then at other times, it had not been ſo great a miracle as to remove backward, which was a courſe directly againſt nature; and therefore doth Hezekiah reject this, and chooſe the going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the ſhaddow to be his ſigne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>He brought the ſhadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the diall of Ahaz.]</hi> Though the ſunnes going backward were the cauſe of the ſhadows going backward, as is expreſſed, Iſaiah 38.8. <hi>Behold I will bring again the ſhadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the ſunne diall of Ahaz, ten degrees backward; ſo the ſunne returned ten degrees, by which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it was gone down:</hi> yet the retiring of the ſhadow is onely expreſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this miraculous turning of the ſunne ten degrees backward, was not ſo eaſily diſcerned in the ſunne it ſelf, as in the ſhadow of the dialls, and though doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſhadow went backward alike in all dialls, yet the diall of Ahaz is onely mentioned; either, becauſe it was the court diall, and ſo in that the ſick king or his ſervants by his appointment, were to obſerve the miracle; or becauſe it was ſet up by Ahaz in ſome publick place for common uſe, and ſo the miracle was therein moſt generally obſerved by the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>At that time Berodach-baladan the ſonne of Baladan king of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon ſent letters and a preſent unto Hezekiah.]</hi> This Berodach-baladan is called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodach-baladan, Iſai. 39.1. by other writers Mardocem-padus; and is by many good writers counted the firſt Babylonian Monarch, at leaſt he is the firſt that took that title: for Eſar-haddon ſucceeding his father Sennacherib in the monarchy of Aſſyria, chap. 19.37. it ſeems this Merodach Sennacheribs lievtenant in Babylon, taking advantage of the loſſe of the Aſſyrians before Jeruſalem (where an Angel had ſlain ſo many thouſands) and withall of the young kings weakneſſe, and his contention with his brothers, revolted from him, and made himſelf king of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Now his Caldeans the great Aſtronomers of thoſe times, having obſerved with aſtoniſhment, this ſtrange alteration in the ſunnes motion, and hearing a report that it was done by the God of the Jews, to aſſure their king of his recovery; Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach took this occaſion to ſend his Embaſſadours to Hezekiah, both to enquire of the wonder, 2. Chron. 32.31. <hi>Howbeit in the buſineſſe of the Embaſſadours of the princes of Babylon, who ſent unto him, to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land,</hi> &amp;c. and to congratulate the recovery of Hezekiah; and withall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to aſſure to himſelf the friendſhip of Hezekiah, a known enemy to the Aſſyrian kings, from whom he was revolted; and therefore it may well be that it was ſome years after that miracle was wrought.</p>

                     <pb n="636" facs="tcp:42229:326"/>Verſ. 13. <hi>And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and ſhewed them the houſe of his precious things,</hi> &amp;c.] Though a little before he had been brought low enough, yet now he was greatly enriched, partly by the ſpoil of Sennacheribs camp, and partly by the rich preſents brought him from many places, 2. Chron. 32.23. <hi>And many brought gifts to the Lord to Jeruſalem, and preſents to Hezekiah king of Judah:</hi> and theſe riches he ſhewed to the Embaſſadours in a vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oſtentation, as being puffed up in his mind, in that he was become the wonder of the world, for the ſunnes going backward for his ſake; and ſought to by a prince ſo farre remote from him, whoſe Embaſſadours he would have ſee, that their maſter had cauſe enough to deſire to be in league with him; and of this pride is that ſpoken, 2. Chron. 32.25. <hi>Hezekiah rendred not again according to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And Hezekiah ſaid, They are come from a farre countrey, even from Babylon.]</hi> This is ſpoken by way of boaſting.</p>

Chron. 32.25. and becauſe his ambition to aſſure himſelf of the Babylonian friendſhip, argued too much truſt in his aid; a great ſinne, in him that had ſuch experience of Gods defence.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my dayes?]</hi> However it be grievous to think that theſe things ſhould befall our poſterity in future times, yet it is Gods mercy, that yet it ſhall not be in my dayes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And how he made a pool,</hi> &amp;c.] This was it ſeems, a great pool in the city of David, and the water was brought in pipes under the ground from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Gihon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Sennacherib did firſt beſiege Jeruſalem, 2.

Chron. 34.3. but upon his hearing of thoſe grievous threatnings in the book of the law againſt idolatry, he now proceeded further and perfected that work of reformation which was then began; and therefore it is that in the Chronicles, the penman of the ſacred hiſtorie, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to relate the reformation that Joſiah wrought in the twelfth yeare of his reigne, he addes alſo what was done afterward when the book of the law was found; and on the other ſide, ſpeaking here how he ſuppreſſed idolatry upon the hearing of the law, he joynes alſo many things which were done of the ſame nature, in the twelfth yeare of his reigne, that all his zealous acts in rooting out idolatry might be related together.

Chron. 13.19. <hi>And Abijah purſued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof:</hi> and ſo perhaps it had ever ſince continued: and ſecondly, it ſeems that the greateſt part of the kingdome of Samaria was at this time under the dominion of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, whence is that verſ. 19. <hi>And all the houſes alſo of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Iſrael had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Joſiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el:</hi> of which two reaſons probable enough may be ſuppoſed: for, firſt, it may be after the flight and death of Sennacherib, when Merodach oppoſed himſelf againſt Eſar-haddon his ſon, Hezekiah took aduantage of this faction in the North, and laid hold upon ſo much of the kingdome of Iſrael, as he was able to people: or ſecondly, perhaps the ſame reaſon that moved the Babylonian king to ſet Manaſſeh free, when he was his priſoner in Babylon, did alſo perſwade him to give him with his libertie the dominion of the greateſt part of the countrey of Samaria; to wit, that he might defend theſe territories againſt the Egyptian, who begun in theſe times with great power and ſucceſſe, to oppoſe the Babylonians; and indeed the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Joſiah in the king of Babels quarrel, notwithſtanding the kings of Judah, had ſo long held great amitie with thoſe of Egypt, 2. Chron. 35.20, 21, 22. doth argue that the compoſition which Manaſſeh had made with that king or his Anceſtour, was upon ſuch friendly terms, as required not onely a faithfull obſervation, but alſo a thankfull requitall.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incenſe,</hi> &amp;c.] The word in the originall, here tranſlated <hi>idolatrous priests,</hi> is <hi>Chemarim;</hi> and becauſe we find them mentioned, Zeph, 1.4. as diſtinct from the prieſts, <hi>I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;</hi> therefore many Expoſitours hold, that they were certain miniſters of their idolatry different from the prieſts, ſuch as the monks are among the papiſts; or at leaſt, that they were a peculiar ſort of prieſts ſo called, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they wore black or coloured garments, or becauſe they lived a retired life in cells and cloiſters, or becauſe of their fierie zeal, and fervencie in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or becauſe they were peculiarly employed in burning incenſe.</p>

Chron. 35.18. it is from the <hi>dayes of Samuel the prophet,</hi> &amp;c. doubtleſſe there could not be ſo great a concourſe of the people to eat the Paſſeover now, when ten of the twelve tribes were carried captive into Aſſyria, as there had been in former ages when all the tribes of Iſrael lived under the government of Saul and David, and Solomon ſucceſſively; but this is ſpoken with reſpect to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſacrifices that were offered at this paſſeover, given bountifully by the king and princes to the people; but eſpecially with reſpect to the exceeding joy of the good people, becauſe religion was reſtored again in its purity amongſt them, and the ſolemnity of all the ſervice that was then performed in the houſe of God: Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah gave then to the people for the paſſeover offering, thirty thouſand lambs and kids, and three thouſand bullocks, and his princes and the chief of the Levites, gave proportionably many thouſands more, as is largely ſet down, 2. Chron. 35.7, 8, 9. and all the ſervice of the feaſt was performed with very great ſolemnity.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And like unto him was there no king before him,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, chap. 18.5.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>His anger was kindled againſt Judah, becauſe of all the provocations that Manaſſeh had provoked him withall.]</hi> So it is ſaid Jer. 15.4. <hi>And I will cauſe them to be removed into all the kingdomes of the earth, becauſe of Manaſſeh.</hi> It is evident that Manaſſeh repented him of his ſinnes, 2. Chron. 33.12— 19. and therefore as ſure it is that the Lord did fully pardon him all his ſinnes, Iſa. 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſſe, plead for the widow; come now and let us reaſon together ſaith the Lord, though your ſinnes were as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made as white as ſnow:</hi> yet here the wrath of God againſt Judah is aſcribed to the ſinnes of Manaſſeh; which is becauſe the Lord doth many times correct his ſervants for their ſinnes, though he hath fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them, and that not onely in their own perſons, but in their poſterity too. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe thoſe ſinnes of Manaſſeh were ſtill ſecretly harboured amongſt the people, though they yielded to Joſiahs reformation for fear; yet in their hearts, and many of them ſecretly in their practiſes too, they did ſtill uphold Manaſſehs wicked wayes; as was indeed moſt remarkably evident in that ſo ſoon as ever Joſiah was dead, even all his children with the people did ſoon return to Manaſſehs idolatry again: whence it was that the Lord complained of Judah, Jer. 3.10. that they had not turned to him with their whole hearts but fainedly; and it was in the dayes of Joſiah the king, verſ. 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>In his dayes Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up against the

king of Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit in the laſt yeare of Joſiahs reigne, which was thirteen years after he kept that ſolemn paſſeover, and perfectly ſuppreſſed idolatry both in Judah, and in a great part of Samaria: it is hard to ſay who this king of Aſſyria was againſt whom the king of Egypt went up. Some conceive it was Eſar-haddon the ſon of Sennacherib, and that it was the revolt of the Medes and the Babylonians from him that invited the king of Egypt at this time to invade his countrey, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers farre more probably hold that it was Nebulaſſer the ſonne of Ben-meradach king of Babylon: for the Babylonians had now gotten the empire from the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and therefore it is no wonder that he ſhould be here called the <hi>king of Aſſyria.</hi>

                     <hi>And king Joſiah went againſt him.]</hi> To wit, to hinder him from paſſing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his countrey: Pharoah ſent Embaſſadours to him to deſire him that he might quietly paſſe thorough his countrey, proteſting that he directed himſelf againſt the Aſſyrians onely, without any harmfull purpoſe againſt Joſiah, but all ſuffered not to prevail with him, 2. Chron. 35.21, 22. which makes it moſt probable that he did it not ſo much out of a fear of ſuffering ſo great an army to enter his countrey, as becauſe he thought himſelf bound in faith and honour to hinder him in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe againſt the Babylonians, to whom he was obliged, either by covenant made at the enlargement of Manaſſeh, or by gift of ſuch part as he held in the kingdome of the ten tribes: but the ſucceſſe was, that Pharoah ſlew Joſiah, he <hi>ſlew him at Megiddo, when he had ſeen him:</hi> that is, at the firſt encounter when he had fought with him, according to that phraſe, chap. 14.8. <hi>Come let us look one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the face;</hi> of which ſee the note there: and thus God puniſhed the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the people by taking their good king from them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And his ſervants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,</hi> &amp;c.] They took him out of the chariot wherein he was wounded, and put him in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chariot, and ſo went preſently to Jeruſalem with him, but being mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he dyed by the way: hence it is ſaid here that <hi>they carried him dead from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddo,</hi> and yet in 2. Chron. 35.29. that <hi>they brought him to Jeruſalem, and he died, and was buried,</hi> &amp;c. what great mourning there was for his death, we may ſee 2. Chron. 35.24. <hi>And Jeremiah lamented for Joſiah, and all the ſinging men, and ſinging women ſpake of Joſiah in their lamentations unto this day, and made them an ordinance in Iſrael, and behold they are written in the Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> whence is that, Zach. 12.11. <hi>In that day ſhall there be great mourning in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the ſonne of Joſiah, and anointed him,</hi> &amp;c.] We read of foure ſonnes that Joſiah had, 1. Chron. 3.15. Johanan, Joakim, Zedekiah, and Shallum; of Johanan, we find no where elſe any mention: either Jehoahaz muſt therefore be the ſame that is called there Johanan, and Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, Jer. 22.11. and then it were no wonder though the people made him king being the firſt born: or elſe rather we muſt hold, that happely Johanan the firſt born dyed before his father, and ſo was never king, and that this Jehoahaz was the ſame that is called Shallum, 1. Chron. 3.15. and was anointed king by the people, though he was not the eldeſt of Joſiahs ſonnes, of which ſee the note verſ. 36. either perhaps becauſe he was beſt affected to the king of Babel, or becauſe he
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:42229:331"/>
was moſt warlike and valiant, and the moſt likely therefore to defend them againſt Necho king of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>And he did that which was evil in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] He preſently ſet up again the idolatry which his father Joſiah had ſuppreſſed, and moſt grievouſly oppreſſed the people, perhaps the faithfull that diſliked this alteration; and in regard of this, he is compared to a young lion that devoured men, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel 19.2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And Pharaoh Necho put him in bands at Riblath,</hi> &amp;c.] Pharaoh Necho returning with victorie from Charchemiſh where he had vanquiſhed the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian, was willing to revenge the oppoſition that was made againſt him at his going forth by Joſiah and his people, who ſought to ſtop him in his paſſage through Judea: and ſo making uſe of the diſſention betwixt Jehoahaz the ſonne of Joſiah by his wife Hamutall and Eliakim the ſonne of Joſiah by his wife Zebudah, who being the elder (of which ſee the note, verſ. 36.) is probably thought to have ſtormed that his younger brother ſhould get the kingdome from him: he ſoon got Jehoahaz or Shallum into his power, and the rather to teſtifie that the kingdome was now at his diſpoſing, he depoſed him, giving away his kingdome to Eliakim his elder brother, to whom of right it did belong; onely impoſing a tribute upon him and the people, and ſo carried away Jehoahaz or Shallum priſoner into Egypt, where he died, according to the prophecy of Jeremiah, Jer. 22.10, 11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, touching Shallum the ſonne of Joſiah king of Judah, which reigned inſtead of Joſiah his father, which went forth out of this place, He ſhall not return thither any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reigne.]</hi> Hereby it is gathered, that Eliakim called by Pharaoh Jehoiakim, was the elder brother; becauſe Jehoahaz when he was made king by the people three moneths before this, was but twenty three years old: indeed they that hold that Jehoahaz was the elder brother, as being the ſame that is called Johanan the firſt born, 1. Chro. 3.15. they ſay that the beginning of Jehoiakims reigne, is accounted from the death of Jehoahaz in Egypt, becauſe till he was dead he governed but as a viceroy in ſtead of his brother; but becauſe he was by Pharaoh made abſolute king, more probable it is that he was the elder brother.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>And he did that which was evil in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an idolatour and a cruell oppreſſour of the people; the rather happely in revenge, becauſe they had formerly preferred his younger brother before him, which is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, Jer. 22.13—19. and Ezek. 19.5, 6, 7. but herein was his impiety chiefly diſcovered, becauſe when the prophets denounced judgements againſt him and his people for their evil wayes, he would not endure it, but perſecuted them for it; one remarkable inſtance whereof, which happened in the beginning of his reigne, we have, Jer. 26.20.23. <hi>There was alſo a man that prophecyed in the name of the Lord, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah the ſonne of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim, who prophecyed againſt this city, and againſt this land, according to all the words of Jeremiah.

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>IN his dayes Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up,</hi> &amp;c.] About three years it is evident that Jehoiakim did peaceably enjoy the throne of Judah, whereon Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt had ſet him: for it was the third yeare of Jehoiakim ere the Babylonians came up againſt him, Dan. 1.1. <hi>In the third yeare of Jehoiakim king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. and the better to prevent all changes, and to ſettle the kingdome in his line, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the accuſtomed policie practiſed by his forefathers, in the ſecond yeare of his reigne he made his ſonne Jehoiachin or Jeconiah king with him, when the boy was but eight years old, 2. Chron. 36.9. of which ſee the note, verſ. 8. but after he had three years peaceably enjoyed his kingdome, paying tribute to the king of Egypt, in his fourth yeare Jeremiah prophecied that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ſhould invade the land, and that both they and all the neighbouring nations about them, ſhould become his ſervants, Jer. 25.1.11. which accordingly came to paſſe; for immediately after this, Nebuchadnezzar the ſecond entred Judea with a ſtrong army, beſieged and forced Jeruſalem, and having Jehoiakim in his power, did at firſt intend to carry him to Babylon, 2. Chron. 36.6. but was at laſt intreated to leave him as his vaſſall, taking with him for pledges, Daniel, being but yet a child, with Ananias, Miſael, and Azarias, with a great deal of the Temples treaſures: nor need we ſtumble at it, that this is ſaid to have been done in the third yeare of Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim, Dan. 1.1. whereas the fourth yeare of Jehoiakim is accounted the firſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, Jer. 25.1. <hi>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Judah, in the fourth yeare of Jehoiakim the ſonne of Joſiah king of Judah, that was the firſt yeare of Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon:</hi> ſince firſt, the firſt yeare of Nebuchadnezzar might well concurre with the end of the third, and the beginning of the fourth yeare of Jehoiakim; and again, ſecondly, perhaps as ſome hold, Nebuchadnezzar the ſecond came firſt againſt Judea, whileſt his father was yet living, in the third yeare of Jehoiakim, and prevailed againſt Jehoiakim; but returning ſoon upon the report of Necho the king of Egypts preparations againſt him, and eſpecially upon the news of his fathers death, that he might prevent all commotions at home, in the fourth yeare of Jehoiakim (having firſt vanquiſhed the forces of the Egyptians about the banks of Euphrates, Jer. 46.1, 2. <hi>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles, againſt Egypt, againſt the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates in Charchemiſh, which Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon ſmote in the fourth yeare of Jehoiakim the ſonne of Joſiah king of Judah</hi>) he ſoon brought Jehoiakim to acknowledge himſelf his vaſſal and tributary, and ſo as it is ſaid here Jehoiakim became his ſervant three years, to wit, the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh years of his reigne; the Egyptian king could not like of this, and therefore it ſeems began to think of reſtoring Jehoahaz (now priſoner in Egypt) and ſetting him up as a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall enemy againſt his ungratefull brother: the rumour whereof when it came to Judea (though Jeremiah prophecied that it ſhould prove idle, Jer, 22.11, 12. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord touching Shallum the ſonne of Joſiah king of Judah, which reigned in ſtead of Joſiah, which went forth out of this place, He ſhall not return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:42229:332"/>
any more. But he ſhall die in the place whither they have led him captive,</hi>) did much perplex them, being now in danger both of the Egyptians, if they kept faith with the Babylonians, and of the Babylonians, if they ſhould revolt again to the Egyptians (and this I conceive might be the cauſe of the faſt, kept in the fifth yeare of Jehoiakims reigne, in the ninth moneth, Jer. 36, 9. At which time Baruch, ſent by Jeremiah, did publickly reade the roll of Jeremiahs propheſie before all the people, which being by the Princes carried to Jehoiakim, he having heard part of it, cut it in pieces with a penknife, and caſt it into the fire) but at length, to wit, in the eighth yeare of his reigne, which was the fourth of Nebuchadnezzar, hearing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glorious rumours of the Egyptians preparations againſt the Babylonians, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned hereby, he renounced his ſubjection to the Babylonian, as is expreſſed here, that he turned, and rebelled againſt him, and ſo ſided with the Egyptians again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the Lord ſent against him bands of the Chaldees,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Nebuchadnezzar (not without the ſpeciall counſel of God) came up againſt him, and that as Joſephus ſaith from that ſiege of Tyre, whereof the Prophet ſpeaks, Ezek. 26.7. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chad-rezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the North, with chariots, and with horſes, and companies, and much people:</hi> and bringing thence with him ſome part of his army, conſiſting of companies, and bands of ſeverall nations, he entred Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and laid hold on Jehoiakim, and being enraged againſt him for his perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in revolting from him, cauſed him to be ſlain, and caſt out into the fields with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Jeruſalem, to be devoured by birds and beaſts; for ſo Jeremy had propheſied it ſhould be, Jer. 22.18, 19. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the ſonne of Joſiah king of Judah, They ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or ah ſiſter, They ſhall not lament for him ſaying, Ah Lord, or ah his glory. He ſhall be buried with the buriall of an aſſe, drawn and caſt forth beyond the gates of Jeruſalem:</hi> and 36.30. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah, He ſhall have none to ſit upon the throne of David, and his dead body ſhall be caſt forth in the dayes to the heat, and in the night to the froſt.</hi> This was the eleventh yeare of Jehoiakim, and ſo the ſeventh yeare of Nebuchadnezzar, three years after Jehoiakims revolt (for either the ſiege of Tyre, or ſome other occaſions had hitherto detained Nebuchadnezzar, from coming againſt him) and hence it is, we reade of three thouſand and three and twenty Jews, carried away by him in the ſeventh yeare of his reigne, Jer. 52.28. <hi>This is the people whom Nebuchad-rezzar carried away captive in the ſeventh yeare, three thouſand and three and twenty Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Surely at the commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them out of his ſight, for the ſinnes of Manaſſeh,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note, chap. 23.26.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>So Jehoiakim ſlept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his ſonne reigned in his ſtead.]</hi> For when Nebuchadnezzar had ſlain Jehoiakim, as is before noted, and was returned again into his own countrey, it ſeems the people made this Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin king in his ſtead, who is alſo called Jeconiah, 1. Chron. 3.16. and Coniah by way of contempt, Jer. 22.24. In the genealogie of Chriſt, Matth. 1.11. Jehoiakim the ſonne of Joſiah, ſeems to be quite left, at leaſt in our moſt uſuall tranſlations; for though in ſome few copies it is thus ſet down, <hi>and Joſias begat Jakim, and Jakim
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:42229:333"/>
begat Jechonias;</hi> yet generally in all other copies it runnes thus, <hi>And Joſias be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon; and after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel:</hi> and for the reſolving of this doubt, many ſeverall anſwers are given by Expoſitours; but the moſt ſatisfying one I conceive is this; to wit, that Jehoiakim the father was called Jeconiah, as well as Jehoiachin the ſonne; and ſo whereas Mat. 1.11. it is ſaid that Joſias begat Jechonias and his brethren, that is meant of Jehoiakim the ſonne of Joſias, who had many brethren; whereas Jehoiachin had none: and then that which follows verſ. 12. and <hi>after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;</hi> that is meant of Jehoiachin the ſonne of Jehoiakim, and ſo the ſeverall generations of theſe kings are fully expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, againſt Jeruſalem: indeed in the latter end of Zedekiahs reigne (Jeruſalem being then beſieged) the king of Egypt <hi>came up to help him againſt the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Jer. 37.5. <hi>Then Pharaohs army came forth out of Egypt, and when the Chaldeans that beſieged Jeruſalem, heard tydings of them, they departed from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> but this here is ſpoken of his coming to ſubdue the Jewes to reduce them again under his ſubjection: this Jehoiakim thought he would have done, when he heard ſuch glorious rumours of the great preparations he made againſt Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer, and thereupon had revolted from the Babylonian; and for this very cauſe it is here expreſſed that he came not, and that the <hi>king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> to ſhew upon what vain grounds Jehoiakim had truſted in Egypt, and ſo thereby had brought all this miſery both on himſelf and on his kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reigne.]</hi> To wit, when he began to reigne alone after his fathers death; for in his fathers life time he was crowned king ten years before this, when he was yet but eight years old, 2. Chron. 36.9. <hi>Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reigne,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he reigned in Jeruſalem three moneths.]</hi> In 2. Chron. 36.9. it is <hi>three moneths and ten dayes;</hi> but the odd dayes, as uſually elſewhere in the Scripture, are here omitted. Indeed there in the Chronicles verſ. 10. it followes that <hi>when the yeare was expired, king Nebuchadnezzer ſent and brought him to Babylon,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome may conceive, that it was a twelvemoneth ere Nebuchadnezzer took him away; and why then ſhould it be ſaid, that he reigned but three moneths: but that which is ſaid there is ſpoken of the yeare abſolutely conſidered, and not of the yeare of Jehoiachins reigne; <hi>when the yeare was expired,</hi> that is, at the ſpring or beginning of a new yeare, <hi>king Nebuchadnezzer ſent and brought him to Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> which was when he had reigned about three moneths, as is here ſaid: ſo that that place in the Chronicles is parallel with that, 2. Sam, 11.1. <hi>and it came to paſſe that after the yeare was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battel, that David ſent Joab,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And he did that which was evil in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] For which cauſe he was threatened by the prophet Jeremiah, that he ſhould die child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and ſhould be carried with his mother and others into Babylon, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah 22.21.30.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="651" facs="tcp:42229:333"/>Verſ. 10. <hi>At that time the ſervants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up againſt Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] It is not expreſſed whether this Jehoiachin were made king by Nebuchadnezzar when he took Jeruſalem, and ſlew his father; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was made king by the people, when Nebuchadnezzar had left the citie: if he were ſet in the throne by Nebuchadnezzar, it may well be (as Joſephus ſaith) that Nebuchadnezzar bethinking himſelf how dangerous it was to leave him in the throne whoſe father he had ſlain, and caſt out unburied, he changed his purpoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and ſent his captains with an army againſt Jeruſalem; to whom himſelf in perſon came within a while after, as intending to depoſe him, and to ſet up another king in his room.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he yielded up both him and his to Nebuchadnezzar, as the prophet Jeremiah had adviſed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the king of Babylon took him in the eighth yeare of his reigne.]</hi> That is, in the eight yeare of Nebuchadnezzars reigne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And he carried out thence all the treaſures of the houſe of the Lord, and the treaſures of the kings houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus was that accompliſhed which God had threatened, when Hezekiah ſhewed his treaſures to the king of Babylons Embaſſadours, Iſaiah 39.6. <hi>Behold, the dayes come, that all that is in thine houſe, and that which thy father's have laid up in ſtore untill this day, ſhall be carried to Babylon; nothing ſhall be left:</hi> yet this particle <hi>all</hi> ſo often mentioned here and in the following verſe, <hi>all the treaſures,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be underſtood with ſome limitation, as namely, that he carryed away all in a manner, or all that he pleaſed; for that he carryed not all away now when he carried away Jechoniah, is evident, Jer. 27.18. &amp;c. where there is mention made of veſſels that remained in the houſe of the Lord, and in the houſe of the king of Judah even after this, in the dayes of Zedekiah the ſucceeding king; which after this were carried away as is related in the following chapter, verſ. 13.14. &amp;c.</p>

After that in the fourth yeare, Zedekiah went to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar, at which time the Prophet gave Sheraiah a prince that went with him a book, wherein was written all the evil that ſhould fall upon Babylon, willing him to read it to the Jews, and then to bind it to a ſtone, and throw it into Euphrates, in token of the perpetuall ſinking of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Jerem. 51.59, 64. at his return as we ſee in the 27. and 28. chapters of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, all the bordering princes ſent meſſengers to Zedekiah, perſwading him as it ſeems, to revolt from Nebuchadnezzar; but Jeremiah did earneſtly diſſwade both him and them, ſending to each of thoſe princes yokes in token of the Babylonian yoke, whereunto the Lord would have them ſubmit, and aſſuring them, that if they would not ſtoop to his yoke, they ſhould all periſh by ſword, fire, and peſtilence: at which time alſo Hananiah having broken Jeremiahs woodden yoke, and vaunting that in like manner within two years Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars yoke ſhould be broken, and Jeconiah with all the veſſels and riches of the Temple, ſhould be brought again to Jeruſalem; Jeremiah foretold of an iron yoke, and to aſſure the people that Hananiah had prophecyed falſely, he

foretold his death, which that yeare accordingly in the ſecond moneth ſeized upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet at length in the eighth yeare of his reigne, Zedekiah practiſed more ſeriouſly with his neighbours, and in confidence of great aids promiſed from Egypt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt Nebuchadnezzar, though he had formerly taken an oath to be faithfull to him, 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>ANd the city was beſieged unto the eleventh yeare of king Zedekiah,</hi> &amp;c.] The city was ſurrounded on the tenth day of the tenth moneth, in the ninth yeare of Zedekiahs reigne, verſe 1. and was taken by ſtorm on the ninth day of the fourth moneth of the eleventh yeare, the ſiege therefore continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a full yeare and an half: when Nebuchadnezzar firſt came againſt the city, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah had propheſied that the city ſhould be taken and burnt, and Zedekiah car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away captive though not ſlain, as Jehoiakim was; for which he was by the inſtigation of the princes clapped up in priſon; ſee Jer. 32, 1, 5.34.1, 7. Jer. 17.38. &amp;c. Indeed a while the Chaldeans left the ſiege, for Pharaoh Hophre a king of Egypt entring the borders of Judah with his army to ſuccour Zedekiah, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar and his Chaldeans fearing the diſadvantage of being ſet upon by the Egyptian army, whileſt they lay before Jeruſalem, where the Jews might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſail them from within the city, they reſolved rather to raiſe the ſiege for a time. At this time the Jews begun to entertain great hopes again, and (as it is probably thought) having in their former extremity ſet free their bondmen (as the law required) by the advice of Zedekiah, when the Chaldeans were gone, they repented them of their charity, and reduced them again into their former ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; ſee Jerem. 34.8, 9, &amp;c. but Zedekiah knowing that if the Egyptians prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, they ſhould ſoon be ſurrounded again with the Chaldean army; he ſent to Jeremiah the prophet to pray for him. and received this meſſage from him by his ſervants; that the Chaldeans ſhould return again, and take the city, and burn it with fire; and being caſt for this by the enraged princes into the dungeon, under a pretence at firſt of his attempting to fly unto the Chaldeans; he often earneſtly perſwaded Zedekiah to yield himſelf to the Chaldeans, and ſo to ſave both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the city. See Jerem. 37. and Jerem. 38. but he not hearkening to him, what the Prophet had ſaid came exactly to paſſe, for the Egyptians not daring to encounter with Nebuchadnezzar, did ſoon return again into Egypt, and abandon their enterprize, and on the other ſide the Chaldeans did as ſpeedily return to the ſiege of Jeruſalem, and never after that left it till they had taken it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>The famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.]</hi> Inſomuch, that as Ezekiel had prophecyed, who begun to propheſie in the fifth yeare of Zedekiahs reigne, Ezekiel 1.2. parents did eat their own children, and children their parents, Ezekiel 5.10. <hi>Therefore the fathers ſhall eat the ſonnes in the middeſt of thee, and the ſonnes ſhall eat the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> &amp;c.

taken, Jerem. 39.3. <hi>And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and ſate in the middle gate,</hi> &amp;c. and then as it followes, all the men of warre fled by night, by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the kings gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; for there was it ſeems a ſecret gate in ſome place near to the kings garden, cloſed upon each ſide with a falſe wall, provided on purpoſe for a means of eſcape in ſuch a time of danger, and through this therefore the ſouldiers with the king, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. 39.4. fled now out of the city, being helped in their flight, either by the darkneſſe of the night, or by the advantage of a cave or vault under ground, into which the ſecret gate led them, and through which they might ſteal away, the beſiegers not ſeeing them; and thus it came to paſſe as Ezekiel had foretold, Ezek. 12.12. <hi>And the prince that is among them ſhall bear upon his ſhoulder in the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and ſhall go forth; they ſhall dig thorough the wall to carry out thereby; he ſhall cover his face that he ſee not the ground with his eyes.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ, 6. <hi>So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah,</hi> &amp;c.] Though therefore it be ſaid verſ. 1. that Nebuchadnezzar came againſt Jeruſalem; yet it ſeems he himſelf ſtayed at Riblah, or at leaſt, thither he was retired in the time of the ſiege, that ſo he might there take care of his own countrey, and might ſupply his army at Jeruſalem with men and proviſion, as need required.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And they ſlew the ſonnes of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah,</hi> &amp;c.] And then was that prophecy of Ezekiel fulfilled, Ezek. 12.13. <hi>My net will I ſpread upon him, and he ſhall be taken in my ſnare, and I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans, yet ſhall he not ſee it, though he ſhall die there.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And in the fifth moneth, on the ſeventh day of the moneth,</hi> &amp;c.] Zedekiah being brought to Riblah to Nebuchadnezzar, in the fourth moneth, and there uſed as aboveſaid, on the ſeventh day of the fifth moneth, Nebuzar-adan was ſent away by the king, with a commiſſion to ruine the city, and carry away the people; who arriving at Jeruſalem the tenth day of the moneth, did accordingly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what the king had commanded, Jer. 52.12. <hi>Now in the fifth moneth, in the tenth day of the moneth, (which was in the nineteenth yeare of Nebuchadnezzars reigne) came Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard, which ſerved the king of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon to Jeruſalem;</hi> and hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, that ſeeming contradiction between theſe two places; whereas here it is ſaid, that it was in the nineteenth yeare of Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar when theſe things were done; yet Jer. 52.29. it is ſaid, that theſe Jews were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away to Babylon in the eighteenth of Nebuchadnezzars reigne; this is onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things were done in the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth of Nebuchadnezzars reigne, for with both theſe years of his reigne did the eleventh of Zedekiahs concurre.</p>

Chron. 36.20, 21. <hi>And them that eſcaped the ſword, carried he away to Babylon, where they were ſervants to him and his ſonnes, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, untill the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths,</hi> &amp;c:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief prieſt, and Zephaniah the ſecond prieſt,</hi> &amp;c.] Seraiah was the grandchild of Hilkiah, who was high prieſt in Hezekiahs time, and father of Jehozadak, who was carried into Babylon, 1. Chron. 6.14. and Zephaniah called here the ſecond prieſt, (concerning which title ſee the note, Numb. 3, 32.) was it ſeems in great eſteem with the king, and therefore uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſent by him to Jeremiah, Jer. 21.1. and 37.3. now becauſe the prieſts were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bitter enemies to Jeremiah, Jer. 26.7, 8. hence we may conceive that both he, and all the reſt here mentioned, were picked out by Nebuzar-adan, not for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity, but for the ſword; becauſe Zedekiah had been much led by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in reſiſting the king of Babylon, contrary to what Jeremiah had commanded them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And out of the city he took an officer that was ſet over the men of warre, and five men of them that were in the kings preſence,</hi> &amp;c.] Jeremiah ſaith ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Jer. 52.25. he took alſo an Eunuch which had the charge of the men of warre, and ſeven men of them that were near the kings perſon; adding two more to theſe here mentioned, which were not perhaps of ſo great note, as theſe five were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And threeſcore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city.]</hi> That is, of the common people, ſuch as it ſeems were of the richer ſort, and had moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the king of Babylon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Over them he made Gedaliah the ſonne of Ahikam, the ſonne of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, ruler.]</hi> Both the favour which Nebuzar-adan ſhewed to this Gedaliah by Nebuchadnezzars appointment, Jer. 40.5. and Jeremiahs making choice to live with him, when Nebuzar-adan had taken him out of priſon, as Nebuchadnezzar had given him order to do; and had given him liberty to go with him into Babylon, or to ſtay where he pleaſed in his own countrey, Jer. 39.11, 12. and 40.1—6, I ſay both theſe
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:42229:336"/>
make it probable, that he was one of them that had followed the advice which the Prophet gave both to Zedekiah and the reſt; to wit, to yield themſelves to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian, Jerem. 21.8, 9, 10. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will ſet before thee the way of life, and the way of death, he that abideth in this citie ſhall die by the ſword, famine, and peſtilence, but he that goeth out and falleth to the Chaldeans that beſiege you, he ſhall live,</hi> &amp;c. and that therefore he was now made provinciall governour of Judea by Nebuchadnezzers command, to rule over them that were carried away captive.</p>
                  <p>Verſ, 23. <hi>And when all the captains of the armies, they, and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governour,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thoſe that fled out of the citie when Jeruſalem was taken verſ. 4.</p>

<pb n="657" facs="tcp:42229:336"/>
to fly with the people that were left into Egypt; firſt indeed they came to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, and asked counſel of him, vowing to do as he ſhould direct them from the Lord, but when he anſwered them, that if they ſtayed in the land God would ſhew them mercy, but if they went down into Egypt, they ſhould all periſh there, they charged him with propheſying falſely in the name of the Lord, and deſpiſing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of God, they went away to Egypt, and carried both Jeremiah and Baruch along with them, and inhabited near unto Taphnes; where when Jeremiah continued to reprove them for their idolatry, and to foretell the deſtruction of Egypt, and of the Jews, that ſought to ſhelter themſelves there (for this, with all before mentioned, is largely related by Ieremiah in the 41, 42, 43, and 44. chapters of his propheſie) he was at length there (as other hiſtories report) ſtoned to death by his own ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countrey-men.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And it came to paſſe in the ſeven and thirtieth yeare of the captivity of Jehoiachin,</hi> &amp;c.] Zedekiah died in priſon in Babylon, Jer. 52.11. <hi>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to Babylon, and put him in priſon till the day of his death:</hi> and had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the honour of being buried as a prince, and lamented at his buriall by his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Jer. 34.5. <hi>But thou ſhalt die in peace, and with the buryings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee: ſo ſhall they burn odours for thee, and they will lament thee, ſaying, Ah Lord; for I have pronounced the word, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But Jehoiachin becauſe he yielded himſelf at Jeremiahs counſel to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer, was at length by Evilmerodach the ſonne of Nebuchadnezzer, taken out of priſon, and uſed with all princely reſpect: indeed whereas here it is ſaid, this was done on the ſeven and twentieth day of the twelfth moneth, Jerem. 52.31. it is ſaid to have been done on the five and twentieth day; but the reaſon of this may be, becauſe order was given for his releaſe on the five and twentieth day, but it was not done till the ſeven and twentieth day, as is here ſaid.</p>

But it is clear that theſe books of the Chronicles, which are a part of the ſacred Scriptures, are not the very ſame that are there mentioned, becauſe many things which are there ſaid to have been related are not here to be found, as we ſee 1. Kings 14.19. Yet theſe were happely collected out of thoſe, and that by Ezra, as it is generally thought. Their chief ſcope is to give us the hiſtory of the kings of Judah entirely by it ſelf, without intermingling the ſtory of the kings of Iſrael, as it is in the books of the kings; and eſpecially to adde ſuch remarkable paſſages concerning Judahs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as were omitted in the books of the kings: whence they are called by the Greek Interpreters <hi>Paralipomena,</hi> that is, paſſages formerly paſſed by and omitted. In the firſt foure verſes we have the line of Adam to Noah, no other of the poſterity of Adam being mentioned, becauſe they were all deſtroyed in the floud.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>The ſonnes of Japheth; Gomer,</hi> &amp;c.] See Gen. 10.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Cuſh begat Nimrod: he began to be mighty upon the earth.]</hi> See Gen. 10.8.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Arphaxad begat Shelah.]</hi> The Septuagint in their Greek tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the old Teſtament, do both here, and alſo Gen. 10.14. inſert one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration more then is in the Hebrew, reading the text thus, <hi>And Arphaxad begat Cainan, and Cainan begat Shelah.</hi> And yet herein according to our tranſlation Luke the Evangeliſt followeth the corrupt Septuagint tranſlation, rather then the Hebrew copies, Luke 3.35, 36. making Salah (or Shelah) the ſonne of Cainan, and Cainan the ſonne of Arphaxad. Now to this it is anſwered that the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt did this, becauſe the Septuagint tranſlation was then of great eſteem, and of moſt frequent uſe amongſt the Jews; and therefore he would not for ſo ſmall a matter, and of no importance, miniſter any occaſion of contention, it being ſufficient for him to ſhew that Chriſt was the ſonne of David, even according to the genealogy of David ſet down by the Septuagint, which in thoſe times paſſed for currant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and that the rather happely, becauſe even to this that clauſe may be referred, Luke 3.23. <hi>(as was ſuppoſed)</hi> namely, that in thoſe dayes it was ſuppoſed by them that followed the Septuagint tranſlation, that Shelah was the ſonne of Cainan, and Cainan the ſonne of Arphaxad. It is indeed true that ſome Interpreters do leave Cainan out of the genealogy of Luke, and alledge that in ſome Greek copies it is not found, which being granted we cannot ſay but they had ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to leave it out. But on the other ſide admitting our tranſlation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt to be juſt and warrantable, the anſwer formerly given for the reconciling
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:42229:338"/>
of this difference, is doubtleſſe the moſt ſatisfying that I any where find amongſt the Expoſitours both of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>The ſonnes of Eſau; Eliphaz, Revel,</hi> &amp;c.] Eliphaz was the ſonne of Eſau by his wife Adah, and Revel by his wife Baſhemath, Gen. 36.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>The ſonnes of Eliphaz; Teman, and Omar, Zephi, and Gatam, Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naz, and Timna, and Amalek.]</hi> Amalek was the ſonne of Eliphaz by Timna his concubine, the ſiſter of Lotan, the ſonne of Seir; of which ſee Gen. 36.12. But this Timna here mentioned was the ſonne of Eliphaz, though of the ſame name with his concubine.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>And the ſonnes of Seir; Lotan,</hi> &amp;c.] This Seir was Prince of the Horites, who at firſt inhabited the land of Edom, till the children of Edom deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and dwelt in their room, Deut. 2.12. <hi>The Horims alſo dwelt in Seir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time, but the children of Eſau ſucceeded them, when they had deſtroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their ſtead;</hi> and therefore is the genealogy of the Horites here recorded, onely becauſe Eſau and his ſonne Eliphaz were joyned in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with theſe Princes of the Horites; and perhaps thence the Edomites took ſome occaſion of quarrel againſt them, and ſo ſeized upon their countrey. The poſterity of Seir here mentioned were dukes in mount Seir, as is noted, Gen. 36.30.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>Now theſe are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,</hi> &amp;c,] See Gen. 36.31.</p>

But the reſt, if they were the ſame Ethan, and Heman, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col, and Dara, mentioned, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And Caleb the ſon of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth.]</hi> This was not Caleb the ſon of Jephunneh, who was but fourty years old when he ſearched Canaan, Joſh. 14.7. but another of the ſame name, the ſonne of Hezron, of whom, ſee Gen. 46.12. and his genealogy is here largely ſet down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were many men of renown amongſt his poſterity, and the chief aim of this chapter is to ſhew how God bleſſed the tribe of Judah, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Gen. 49.8, &amp;c. <hi>Judah thou art he whom thy brethren ſhall praiſe: thy hand

                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And he took Geſhur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he took Geſhur and Aram from thoſe that were the ancient inhabitants. But this was Geſhur without Jordan, in the portion of the half tribe of Manaſſeh there ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for there was another Geſhuri within Jordan, that was not ſubdued when Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua began to divide the land amongſt the Iſraelites, Joſh. 13.2. As for Kenath he took that (as it ſeems) by means of Nobah, who happely was one of his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or captains, and fought againſt Kenath under the command of Jair, Numb. 32.41, 42. <hi>And Jair the ſonne of Manaſſeh went and took the ſmall towns thereof, and called them Havoth-jair.

                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>Now the ſonnes of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were, Meſha his firſt-born, which was the father of Ziph.]</hi> Theſe were his ſonnes by Azubah his firſt wife, of whom mention was made, verſ. 18. and <hi>Meſha his firſt-born</hi> is called <hi>the father of Ziph,</hi> becauſe he was the father of the inhabitants of Ziph.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 50. <hi>Theſe were the ſonnes of Caleb the ſonne of Hur,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of a ſecond Caleb, the ſonne of Hur, mentioned before, verſ. 20. and the firſt mentioned is <hi>Shobal the father of Kirjath-jearim,</hi> which may be underſtood as that above, verſ. 42.</p>

For Noga is not there mentioned, and but one Eliphalet; whereas it is manifeſt by this place, that he had two ſonnes (perhaps by two ſeverall wives) that were called Eliphelet, as he had two alſo that were called Eliſhama; for he that is called Eliſhua, 2. Sam. 5.15. is here called Eliſhama.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the ſonnes of Joſiah were, the firſt-born Johanan,</hi> &amp;c.] Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Johanan was indeed the firſt-born of Joſiahs ſonnes, but dyed before his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo never came to the kingdome, and then it is Jehoahaz that was firſt king that is here called Shallum, and reckoned in the fourth place; or elſe Jehoahaz is here called Johanan, and is called the firſt-born, either becauſe he was indeed the eldeſt of Joſiahs ſonnes, (of which ſee the notes on 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And the ſonnes of Jehoiakim; Jeconiah his ſonne, Zedekiah his ſonne.]</hi> It is manifeſt that Zedekiah who was made king of Judah by the king of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, when Jehoiachin or Jeconiah was carried captive to Babylon, and was the loſt king of Judah, was the ſonne of Joſiah, 2. Kings 24.17. the brother of Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim, and uncle of Jehojachin or Jeconiah who was king immediately before him; either therefore Zedekiah the laſt king of Judah, is here called the ſonne of Jeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah or Jehojachin, onely becauſe he ſucceeded him (as his heir) in the throne of Judah; or elſe this Zedekiah here mentioned, is not Zedekiah the ſonne of Joſiah king of Judah, but another of that name, the ſonne of Jehoiakim, and brother of Jehojachin, or Jeconiah, who is no where elſe mentioned in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the ſonnes of Jeconiah; Aſſir, Salathiel his ſonne,</hi> &amp;c.] Though it was prophecyed concerning Jeconiah, that he ſhould be as a man that was childleſſe, in regard of having the royall dignity continued in his poſterity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of his ſeed ſhould ſit in the throne of David, Jer. 22.30. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Write ye this man childleſſe, a man that ſhall not proſper in his dayes: for no man of his ſeed ſhall proſper, ſitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah:</hi> yet it is evident by this place, that he had ſeverall ſonnes after he was carried into Babylon; to wit, Aſſir, and Salathiel, and Malchiram, &amp;c. eight in number; unleſſe we ſhould conceive, that Salathiel and thoſe that follow were the grandchildren of Jeconiah, by his ſonne Aſſir, as the words ſeeme to imply, <hi>Aſſir, Salathiel his ſonne;</hi> or that Salathiel was called Aſſir Salathiel, which may ſeeme the more probable, becauſe, <hi>Aſſir</hi> ſignifieth <hi>one in bonds;</hi> and ſo Salathiel might be called in reference to Jeconiahs being carried bound into Babylon, (as we ſee the like in Gerſhom, Exod. 2.22.) as alſo becauſe Salathiel is named as the ſonne of Jeconiah, Matth. 1.12. <hi>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias begat Salathiel.</hi> Indeed ſome conceive that Salathiel came of the ſtock of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and is here onely mentioned as a ſonne of Jeconiah, becauſe he ſucceeded in ſome kind of government after Jeconiah, and that he was of the ſtock of Nathan: But me thinks it is farre more probable that this Salathiel here mentioned, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Matth. 1.12. was indeed the true ſonne of Jeconiah, and that both Salathiel and Zerubbabel mentioned by Luke, chapter 3.27. are diverſe from theſe mentioned here, and in Matthew.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And the ſonnes of Pedaiah were, Zerubbabel and Shimei.]</hi> Pedaiah is mentioned in the former verſe, as a ſonne of Jeconiah, and made here the father of Zerubbabel; evident indeed it is, that Salathiel had alſo a ſonne called Zerubbabel, Matth. 1.12. <hi>and Salathiel begat Zorobabel.</hi> Hag. 1.1. <hi>In the ſecond yeare of Darius — came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, unto Zerubbabel the ſonne of Shealtiel.</hi> But this Zerubbabel was it ſeemes the ſonne of Pedaiah, who was the brother or uncle of Salathiel.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THe ſonnes of Judah; Pharez, Hezron,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the poſterity of Judah: for onely Pharez was Judahs ſonne immediately, and Hezron was the ſonne of Pharez, and Carmi called alſo Chelubai and Caleb was the ſonne of Hezron, chap. 2.9, 18. and Hur was the ſonne of Carmi or Caleb, chap. 2.19. and Shobal was the ſonne of Caleb, the ſonne of Hur, chap. 2.50. and Reaiah, or Haroe, chap. 2.52. was the ſonne of Shobal; and becauſe this Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals poſterity were here to be more fully expreſſed, verſ. 2. therefore in the firſt verſe it is ſhewen briefly, how he was lineally deſcended from Judah; from hence unto the tenth chapter the families of all the ſeverall tribes are expreſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Zebulon and Dan; and Dan ſome ſay is omitted, becauſe there was but one family of that tribe, to wit, the family of Huſhim, Gen. 46.23.

                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>And their villages were,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, their towns or cities unwalled.</p>

This muſt needs be done in the beginning of Hezekiahs reigne, for in the ſixth yeare of his reigne, the ten tribes were carried away captive, 2. Kings 18.10, 11. <hi>And at the end of three years they took it: even in the ſixth yeare of Hezekiah (that is the ninth yeare of Hoſhea king of Iſrael) Samaria was taken. And the king of Aſſyria did carry away Iſrael unto Aſſyria.</hi> So that it ſeems they did not long enjoy theſe their new conqueſts, unleſſe happely this new colony of the tribe of Simeon, were part of that ſmall remnant of the ten tribes that were not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away (and that happely becauſe they dwelt farre up in the kingdome of Judah) but remained in the land even in the dayes of Joſiah, Hezekiahs grandchild; whence is that. 2. Chron. 24 9. <hi>And when they came to Hilkiah the high Prieſt, they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the money that was brought into the houſe of God, which the Levites that kept the doore had gathered of the hand of Manaſſeh, and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Iſrael, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and they returned to Jeruſalem.</hi>

How long he lived high prieſt it is no where expreſſed; but probable it is he was high prieſt all the time that the people ſerved the Lord after Joſhuahs death, in the dayes of the elders that out-lived Joſhua, Judg. 2.7. and perhaps in the time of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting of the people in the time of the Judges (which muſt needs then be a matter of much grief to a man of ſuch zeal as he was) for it is evident that when the Iſraelites made warre againſt Benjamin, he was high prieſt, Joſh. 20.28. <hi>And Phinehas the ſonne of Eleazar, the ſonne of Aaron ſtood before it in thoſe dayes.</hi> As for the next three that follow, <hi>Abiſhau, &amp; Bukki his ſonne, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzi his ſonne,</hi> they were it ſeems high prieſts in thoſe corrupteſt times of Iſrael under the Judges: whereto agrees that which is by ſome ſaid, that in the dayes of Uzzi it was that Eli (and ſo his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity after him) got the high prieſts office, not being of Eleazars ſtock, but of the ſtock of Ithamar: and if ſo it were, then the foure next following of the ſtock of Eleazar were never high prieſts, to wit, Zerahiah, and Meraioth, and Amariah, and Ahitub; but Zadok the ſonne of Ahitub, verſ. 8. was the firſt that recovered that dignity again, which was in the dayes of Solomon, who thruſt out Abiathar of the poſterity of Eli, and of the ſtock of Ithamar, from being high prieſt, and put Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok the ſonne of Ahitub in his room, 1.

Having before ſet down the genealogies of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Iſſachars is next here related, becauſe Iſſachar was Jacobs next ſonne by Leah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Whoſe number was in the dayes of David two and twenty thouſand and ſix hundred.]</hi> To wit, when he appointed Joab to number the people, 2. Sam. 24.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the ſonnes of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the ſonnes of Izrahiah; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, and Obadiah, and Joel, Iſhiah, five.]</hi> That is, there were five deſcended of Uzzi, to wit, Izrahiah, and his foure ſonnes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And with them, by their generations, after the houſe of their fathers were bands of ſouldiers,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby it is evident that there were ſix and thirty thouſand men of the poſterity of Uzzi alone; ſo that the two and twenty thouſand ſix hundred, mentioned before verſ. 2. was the number of the poſterity of Tola by his other ſonnes, Uzzi being excepted, whoſe poſterity are here numbred by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as being more then all the reſt together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="670" facs="tcp:42229:344"/>Verſ. 5. <hi>And their brethren among all the families of Iſſachar, were men of might,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, all the children of Iſſachar together, were <hi>foureſcore and ſeven thouſand men of might</hi> when Joab numbred them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>The ſonnes of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jodiael, three.]</hi> Jedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el is called Aſhbel, Gen. 46.21. Zebulun was the ſixth ſonne of Leah, born next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Iſſachar; but neither Zebuluns nor Dans genealogie is at all here mentioned; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe at the return of the people out of Babylon, (when it is thought that Ezra wrote this book) their genealogies were not found. Benjamins genealogy is therefore next inſerted, who was the ſonne of Rachel; yet here are but onely three of Benjamins ten ſonnes mentioned, perhaps becauſe the poſterity of theſe onely were numbred, when Joab numbred the people, verſ. 2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Shuppim alſo, and Huppim,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, theſe alſo were of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>The ſonnes of Naphtali; Jahziel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shallum, the ſonnes of Bilhah.]</hi> That is, the grand-children; for Bilhah Rachels handmaid was the mother of Naphtali, whoſe ſonnes theſe were.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>The ſonnes of Manaſſeh; Aſhriel whom ſhe bare,</hi> &amp;c.] There was an Aſhriel that was the ſonne or one of the poſterity of Gilead, Numb. 26.30, 31. <hi>Theſe are the ſonnes of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the Jeezerites: of Helek, the family of the Helekites: And of Aſriel, the family of the Aſrielites: and of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, the family of the Shechemites:</hi> either therefore this was another Aſhriel, the immediate ſonne of Manaſſeh by his wife; whereas Machir was Manaſſehs ſonne by his concubine the Aramiteſſe: or elſe Aſhriel is here reckoned onely as one of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of Manaſſeh; <hi>whom ſhe bare,</hi> that is, either the wife of Gilead, or the wife of Hepher, the mother of Zelophehad, and thence it follows, verſ. 15. that <hi>Zelophehad</hi> (who was the ſonne of Hepher, the ſonne of Gilead, Num. 27.1.) <hi>was the ſecond,</hi> that is, the ſecond ſonne of Hepher, the younger brother of Aſhriel. And if we thus take Aſhriel for one of the poſterity of Gilead the ſonne of Machir, then we muſt underſtand that the following words, <hi>But his concubine the Aramiteſſe bare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir,</hi> &amp;c. are onely added, to ſhew that this Aſhriel, and the reſt afterward menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, were not the poſterity of Manaſſeh by his wife, but by his concubine the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramiteſſe:</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Theſe were the ſonnes of Gilead,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Aſhriel and Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phehad above mentioned; but not Pereſh, and Shereſh, and his poſteritie the laſt here mentioned: for they were the ſonnes of Machir by Maachah, and ſo the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Gilead.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And his ſiſter Hammoleketh bare Iſhhad,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Gileads ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And the ſonnes of Shemida were Ahian,</hi> &amp;c.] And Shemida was alſo the ſonne (or of the ſtock) of Gilead: ſee Numb. 26.30, 32.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Whom the men of Gath that were born in that land ſlew,</hi> &amp;c.] Either this muſt be referred to all thoſe before named, verſ. 20. <hi>the ſonnes of Ephraim; Shuthelah, and Bered his ſonne, and Tahath his ſonne,</hi> &amp;c. to wit, as taking them all to be the ſeverall ſonnes of Ephraim; namely that Shuthelah, verſ. 20. was the ſonne of Ephraim, and ſo alſo Bered (who ſeems to be mentioned as the ſonne of Shuthelah) was another ſonne of Ephraim, and Tahath another, and ſo on forward:
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:42229:344"/>
who were all ſlain by the men of Gath, when the Iſraelites were in Egypt: or elſe (if this ſeems not ſo probable, becauſe then Ephraim ſhould have two ſonnes called Shuthelah, and two called Tahath) then though thoſe in the twentieth verſe be taken as ſeverall generations, to wit, that Shuthelah was the ſonne of Ephraim, and Bered his grandchild, and Tahath his grandchild, and ſo forward, yet Zabad the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned verſ. 21. muſt be reckoned another ſonne of Ephraim, and Shuthelah, and Ezer, and Elead his grandchildren, <hi>whom the men of Gath ſlew:</hi> or thirdly, if all thoſe before mentioned be reckoned as ſeverall ſucceeding generations, to wit, that Shuthelah the ſonne of Ephraim begat Bered, and Bered Tahath, and Tahath Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and Eladah Tahath, and Tahath Zabad, and Zabad Shuthelah, and Ezer, and Elead, then the words (<hi>whom the men of Gath ſlew,</hi> &amp;c.) muſt be referred onely to ſome of the former of theſe here mentioned: or fourthly, that which follows, verſ. 22. <hi>And Ephraim their father mourned many dayes, and his brethren came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him,</hi> muſt be meant of Zabad, who was called alſo Ephraim, perhaps onely becauſe he was the head of that tribe; for it is not poſſible, that Ephraim ſhould live to ſee theſe laſt here mentioned, if they be all taken as ſeverall ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, to wit, ſeven generations. However, though this which is ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe why the men of Gath ſlew them; to wit, <hi>becauſe they came down to take away their cattell,</hi> may be meant of the Philiſtines of Gath, that coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Iſraelites dwelling then in Egypt, to take away their cattell, they ſlew theſe ſonnes of Ephraim, that armed themſelves to reſiſt them; yet rather I think it is meant of the ſonnes of Ephraim, to wit, that there being uſually warre betwixt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt and the Philiſtines their neighbours (to which thoſe places may have reference, Exod. 1.10. <hi>Come on, let us deal wiſely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to paſſe, that when there fall out any warre, they joyn alſo unto our enemies, and fight againſt us, and ſo get them up out of the land,</hi> and 13.17. <hi>And it came to paſſe when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near: for God ſaid, Leſt peradventure the people repent when they ſee warre, and they returne to Egypt.</hi>) the ſonnes of Ephraim at a certain time armed themſelves to make an inrode upon the land of the Philiſtines, and were ſlain by the men of Gath; for why is it ſaid, the men of Gath that were born in that land, but to intimate, that they inhabited the land that was invaded by the ſonnes of Ephraim? and of this ſlaughter of the Ephraimites, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that place, Pſal. 78.9. <hi>The children of Ephraim being armed and carrying bowes, turned back in the day of battel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And his daughter was Sherah, who built Beth-horon the nether, and the upper,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Sherah famous in her time for building, that is, rebuilding, beautifying, and fortifying theſe cities, (for the upper and nether Beth-horon were cities in Canaan before the Iſraelites poſſeſſed them, Joſh. 16.6.) ſhe was alſo of the ſtock of Beriah: for had ſhe been the immediate daughter of Beriah, the ſonne of Ephraim, ſhe could not have lived to enter the land of Canaan.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Ammihud his ſonne, Eliſhama his ſonne.]</hi> Who was prince of the children of Ephraim at their going down out of Egypt. Numb. 7.48. <hi>On the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, Eliſhama the ſonne of Ammiud, prince of the children of Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, offered.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>And the ſonnes of Jether,</hi> &amp;c.] This Jether is called Ithran in the former verſe, as moſt conceive.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And the ſonnes of Ulla,</hi> &amp;c.] Who was happely another ſonne of Jether, or elſe his grandchild the ſonne of Ara before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>And the number throughout the genealogie of them that were apt to the warre and to battel, was twenty and ſix thouſand men.]</hi> To wit, happely when they were numbred in the dayes of David, as above verſ. 2.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>NOw Benjamin begat Bela his firſt-born,</hi> &amp;c.] Some thing was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid concerning three of Benjamins ſonnes, chap. 7.6. but here the genealogie of Benjamin is more fully expreſſed. 1. Becauſe the tribe of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min did alwayes moſt conſtantly adhere to the houſe and kingdome of David. And ſecondly to diſcover the ſtock of Saul the firſt king of Iſrael. Indeed Gen. 46.21. there are ten ſonnes of Benjamin named, but the genealogie of five of them onely is here recorded; becauſe happely of the others there were no men of any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, or perhaps becauſe their genealogies were leſt, Aſhbel the ſecond, is called alſo Jediael, chap. 7.6. and Aharah Ahiram. Numb. 26.38. and Ehi, Gen. 46.21. and Nohah Naaman, Gen. 46.21. and Rapha Roſh, Gen. 46.21.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the ſonnes of Bela were, Addar, and Gera,</hi> &amp;c.] Five other ſonnes of Bela are mentioned, chap. 7.7. to which here are added nine more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it neceſſary that we ſhould think that all theſe were the immediate ſonnes of Bela; (for here we ſee are two Geraes mentioned, and men do not uſe to call two ſonnes by one name) but onely that they were men of renown of his poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And theſe are the ſonnes of Ehud,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this place (I conceive) is, that ſome of theſe before mentioned that were of the poſterity of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, were more immediately the ſonnes of Ehud, chief of the fathers of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Geba, who finding that place too ſtrait for them, <hi>removed themſelves to Manahath,</hi> together with Naaman, and Ahiah called Ahoah verſ. 4. and Gera, and dwelt there.</p>

Sam. 7.6. he it ſeems began to divide the work amongſt them, and to appoint them their ſeverall charges and imployments, which David afterward did much perfect, appointing ſo many ſeverall courſes for the ſeverall ſervices of the Temple, and ſo by their turnes they attended, in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places, the work of Gods houſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>So they and their children had the over ſight of the gates of the houſe of the Lord, namely, the houſe of the Tabernacle, by wards.]</hi> Some at one gate, and ſome at an other.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And theſe are the ſingers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers, were free.]</hi> That is, the Levites; they were alſo the ſingers in the Temple, who were freed from all other imployments, becauſe they were continually imployed in that work.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen all Iſrael gathered themſelves to David unto Hebron,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Iſhboſheth being ſlain, when David had already reigned ſeven years in Hebron: for betwixt the death of Saul and this anointing of David by all the tribes of Iſrael, many things are recorded in the foure firſt chapters of the ſecond of Samuel, which are here omitted: now what needs explanation in theſe three firſt verſes, ſee in the notes upon 2. Sam. 5, 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And David and all Iſrael went to Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to take the ſtrong hold of Zion, a part of Jeruſalem which was ſtill in the Jebuſites poſſeſſion; ſee 2. Sam. 5.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the inhabitants of Jebus ſaid to David, Thou ſhalt not come hither.]</hi> Adding withall by way of deriſion, <hi>except thou take away the blind and the lame;</hi> of which ſee 2. Sam. 5.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>So Joab the ſonne of Zeruiah went firſt up, and was chief.]</hi> Joab was before one of Davids chief captains, 2. Sam. 3.22, 23. but not the Generall over all his forces, or if he were, it was not over all the forces of Iſrael, but onely over the forces of Judah (for till now the other tribes had not taken them for their king:) that honour was now conferred upon him for this ſervice of his, in taking the fort of Zion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about,</hi> &amp;c.] See 2. Sam. 5.9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Theſe alſo are the chief of the mighty men whom David had,</hi> &amp;c,] See 2. Sam. 23.8.</p>

Sam. 23.11. whoſe name is not here expreſſed; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom, and the brave exploit here mentioned of this Eleazar and Shammah, ſee 2. Sam. 23.11.

                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David,</hi> &amp;c.] See 2, Sam. 23.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And David longed, and ſaid, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem,</hi> &amp;c.] See the notes concerning this paſſage, 2. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Veeſ. 19. <hi>Theſe things did theſe three mightiest.]</hi> That is, Davids three chief worthies; yet ſome conceive that it is meant of the ſecond three, whereof Abiſhai was the chief. 1. Becauſe the words immediately following, verſ. 20. <hi>And Abiſhai the brother of Joab he was chief of the three,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem to have reſpect to that which went before. 2. Becauſe this is onely expreſſed thus, 2. Sam. 13.17. <hi>Theſe things did theſe three mighty men,</hi> whence they inferre that they are here called <hi>the mightieſt</hi> onely with reſpect to the thirty; of whom, or in regard of whom, they were the mightieſt, not that they were the three chief of his worthies: but the firſt expoſition I conceive moſt probable, ſee 2. Sam. 23.13.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And Abiſhai the brother of Joab, he was cheif of the three.]</hi> See 2. Sam. 23.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Benaiah the ſonne of Jehoiada, the ſonne of a valiant man of Kabzeel,</hi> &amp;c.] See 2. Sam. 23.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alſo he went down and ſlew a lion in a pit in a ſnowie day.]</hi> This may be added to intimate how the lion came to be ſhut up in a pit, to wit, the pits mouth being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſnow, as he was going over it he fell into it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24.<hi>Theſe things did Benaiah the ſonne of Jehoiada, and had the name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the three mightie.]</hi> See 2. Sam. 23.22.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>The ſonnes of Haſhem the Gizonite, Jonathan the ſonne of Shage the Hararite.]</hi> And Shammah the other ſonne of Haſhem, or Jaſhen, as is expreſſed, 2. Sam. 23.32, 33. though here omitted.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. <hi>Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the ſonne of Ahlai,</hi> &amp;c.] 2. Sam. 23. Uriah is the laſt mentioned; but to thoſe ſome other are here added, becauſe though they were not of the thirty, yet they were captains of great note and eſteem in Davids armies.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And Iſhmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty.]</hi> That is, among and over the thirty warriers of the tribe of Benjamin here mentioned, that came to David to Ziglag, whoſe colonell he was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="678" facs="tcp:42229:348"/>Verſ. 8. <hi>And of the Gadites there ſeparated themſelves unto David into the hold to the wilderneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be meant of the hold at Ziklag, which was in the wilderneſſe of Judea, whither theſe Gadites came, <hi>men whoſe faces were like the faces of lions,</hi> that is, undaunted, fierce and terrible to their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>One of the leaſt was over an hundred, and the greateſt over a thouſand.]</hi> That is, they were all captains of bands, (to wit, before they came to David, or after David began to reigne in Hebron) ſome of them over an hundred, ſome over a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Theſe are they that went over Jordan in the first moneth, when it had over-flown all his banks.]</hi> Jordan did uſually in the firſt moneth overflow all his banks; ſee Joſh. 3.15. and 4.19. yet theſe Gadites (that muſt neceſſarily paſſe the river to come to the help of David, becauſe they dwelt in the land of Sihon and Og beyond Jordan) would not hereby be kept from the ſuccour of David, but made ſome ſhift to get over, either by ſwimming, or by boats, &amp;c. and this is here noted, to ſhew how zealous they were in Davids cauſe: yet were there any enemies appointed to hinder their paſſage, happely this inundation of Jordan was an advantage to them, as making the enemy ſecure, when they thought becauſe of the floud there was no danger of their coming over, and to that end happely it is expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the eaſt, and toward the weſt.]</hi> This is either meant of ſuch of Sauls ſouldiers as were in theſe troubleſome times appointed to be in the valleys, that lay upon the banks of Jordan, to guard the foords and paſſages of Jordan, leſt any well-affected to David ſhould from thoſe parts come over to his aid, upon whom theſe Gadites came ſuddenly, and ſcattered them, ſome flying one way, and ſome another; or rather (as ſome conceive) it is meant of the Philiſtines and others, who prevailing in the laſt warre wherein Saul was ſlain, had ſeiſed upon certain towns and villages in the valleys, whence they were immediately driven by theſe war-like Gadites.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Then the ſpirit came upon Amaſai, who was chief of the captains, and he ſaid, Thine are we David,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, God by his ſpirit moved him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with ſuch confidence, and deteſtation of all thoughts of treachery, as is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſed, and that in the name of them all, that all jealouſies concerning thoſe of the tribe of Benjamin that were in their company, verſ. 16. might be removed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And they helped David againſt the band of the rovers,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, the Amalekites that had burnt Ziklag, 1. Sam. 30.1, 2. whom David with his foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men purſued, verſ. 10. taking theſe ſeven captains of Manaſſeh along with him that at that time were newly come to him for his help.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>For at that time day by day, there came to David to help him, untill it was a great hoſt, like the hoſt of God.]</hi> That is, innumerable as the Angels; Dan. 7.10. <hi>A fiery ſtream iſſued, and came forth from before him: thouſand thouſands mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him: the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſet, and the books were opened.</hi> Beſides, the Hebrews ſay a thing is of God when it is excellent, as <hi>Cedars of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>The children of Judah that bare ſhield and ſpear, were ſix thouſand and eight hundred,</hi> &amp;c.] In many of the other tribes there are many more, yet was the tribe of Judah the greateſt of all, and moſt zealous for David; but they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:42229:348"/>
anointed David to be their king, neither was it therefore neceſſary that they ſhould now approve their deſire of him, by coming in ſuch multitudes to be preſent at Hebron, at this ſolemnity of his being anointed king there over all Iſrael, as the other tribes did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites.]</hi> The meaning of this is not, that Jehoiada was the high prieſt (for certainly Abiathar that came to David in his troubles, and brought the Ephod with him, 1. Sam. 23.6. was at this time high-prieſt) but the meaning is, that he was the chief of thoſe of Aarons family that came now with the tribes of Iſrael to Hebron, to ſubmit themſelves to Davids go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to attend the ſolemnity of his inauguration there.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chief man, and leader amongſt theſe ſonnes of Aaron, in bringing them in to ſubmit themſelves to Davids government. And the rather, as I conceive, is he and the two and twenty captains of his fathers houſe here particularly mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was afterward the high prieſt in the dayes of Solomon; 1. Kings 2.35, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok the prieſt did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>For hitherto the greateſt part of them had kept the ward of the houſe of Saul.]</hi> That is, unto this time the greateſt part of this tribe of Benjamin, had ſought to keep the kingdome in Sauls family, and ſo could not yet be from their hearts contented with ſettling David in the throne, and therefore there came but a few (in compariſon) of this tribe to David.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And of the half tribe of Manaſſeh, eighteen thouſand,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, of that half of Manaſſeh which was ſeated within Jordan (for the other half are ſpoken of afterward verſ. 37.) there were <hi>eighteen thouſand which were expreſſed by name,</hi> that is, which were choſen by name to be imployed in this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>And of the children of Iſſachar, which were men that had underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do,</hi> &amp;c.] Some referre this to their knowledge in Aſtrologie, by which they might be able to foreſee the aire and ſeaſons, a matter of great conſequence in many affairs; and this they judge the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe the children of Iſſachar were for the moſt part much exerciſed in hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, as is noted upon Gen. 49.14. and Deut. 33.18. and ſuch men in old time were very skilfull in the knowledge of the ſtarres, &amp;c. But I rather think it is meant of men that were ſingularly prudent, and able to give advice for the doing of every thing that was to be undertaken, in the fitteſt time and ſeaſon; and that, firſt, becauſe we find the like phraſe uſed concerning Ahaſuerus his counſellours, Eſth. 1.13. to wit, that they were <hi>wiſe men which knew the times;</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe it is ſaid in the next words, that <hi>all their brethren were at their commandment,</hi> that is, that out of the high eſteem they had of theſe mens wiſedome and ſingular prudence, they were ſtill willing to be directed and ordered by them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>All theſe men of warre, that could keep rank,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, all thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, which are in all three hundred twenty two thouſand two hundred twenty two.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And there they were with David three dayes, eating and drinkinge for their brethren had prepared for them.]</hi> That is, the reſt of the Iſraelites.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we enquired not at it in the dayes of Saul.]</hi> That is, from the dayes of Saul hitherto, we have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the ark to continue in a private houſe, no man regarding it, and have contented our ſelves to worſhip God in the Tabernacle at Gibeah, though the ark, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods preſence were not in it. But why doth he not alſo ſay in the dayes of Samuel, ſince ever ſince his dayes the ark had been in the houſe of Abinadab? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, firſt, becauſe he deſired to accuſe themſelves that were then living, rather then their forefathers: And ſecondly, becauſe in the dayes of Samuel by reaſon of the continuall warres they had with the Philiſtines, they had not ſo good opportunity to remove the ark, as they had afterward.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the prieſts,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive that Abiathar here mentioned was the high prieſt, and Zadok his great deputy, the ſame that is called the ſecond prieſt, 2.

But I rather conceive that theſe two were the two heads (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the high prieſt) of the two families of Eleazar and Ithamar, even the ſame that are elſewhere called Zadok and Ahimelech, 2 Sam. 8.27.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And with them their brethren of the ſecond degree, Zachariah,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe Levites here mentioned are ſaid to be <hi>of the ſecond degree,</hi> either onely becauſe they were inferiour in dignity to thoſe three before mentioned, verſ. 17. that were the chief of the quire; or happely becauſe thoſe three of the firſt degree went before the ark, and theſe followed after it; or thoſe three of the firſt degree began the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and then theſe of the ſecond degree anſwered them. Ben the ſecond of thoſe here mentioned ſeems to be left out, verſ. 20, 21. where the reſt are named again. But I conceive rather, that he it is, that is there alſo called Azariah, verſ. 21. And whereas it is added in the cloſe of this verſe, that all theſe that were thus now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to play on ſeverall inſtruments, at leaſt the two laſt of them, were ſuch of the Levites, as were alſo <hi>the porters;</hi> hereby I conceive is meant, not onely that their office was to keep the doores at other times; to wit, either in the Tabernacle of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that was at Gibeon, chap. 16.39. or in the tent which David had prepared at his houſe, to which they were now carrying the ark; but alſo that at preſent they had the charge of keeping off thoſe that might otherwiſe have preſſed in upon the ark.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>So the ſingers, Heman, Aſaph, and Ethan, were appointed to ſound with cymbals of braſſe.]</hi> Here is expreſſed what inſtruments they were ſeverally to play upon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And Zachariah, and Aziel—with pſalteries on Alamoth.]</hi> By <hi>Alamoth</hi> is meant either ſome muſicall inſtrument, or tune ſo called; or elſe, as moſt Expoſitours hold, that part in muſick which we call the treble, we find it in the title of the fourty ſixth Pſalme, <hi>To the chief muſician for the ſonnes of Korah. A ſong upon Alamoth.</hi> The word in the originall ſignifieth young maidens, or virgins, and ſo Expoſitours do therefore the rather think it is meant of the treble, becauſe their voice is ſhrill, and fitteſt for that part in muſick.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And Mattithiah, and Eliphaleh—with harps, on the Sheminith to excell.]</hi> Hereby is meant a ſeverall tune alſo, or inſtrument of eight ſtrings: for the originall word ſignifieth <hi>the eight,</hi> it is mentioned in the title of the ſixth Pſalme, <hi>To the chief muſician on Neginoth, upon Sheminith, a Pſalm of David;</hi> but moſt hold that it was the baſe which being the moſt gracefull part of muſick, is therefore ſaid to <hi>excell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And Berechiah, and Elkanah were doore-keepers for the ark.]</hi> That is, they were appointed to keep the doore of the tent where the ark was afterwards
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:42229:350"/>
kept, and accordingly were imployed now in obſerving that no body ſhould preſſe in upon the ark; the like is again ſaid verſ. 24. of Obed-Edom, and Jehiah; and happely two went before the ark, and two came after it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>And it came to paſſe when God helped the Levites that bare the ark,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſo ſoon as they perceived that God was with them in the buſineſſe, and did not ſtrike them with death as Uzza was, by way of thankfulneſſe they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up ſacrifices, and this was ſo ſoon as they had gone ſix paces, 2. Sam. 6.13. yet others very probably underſtand this place thus, that when the Levites that had carried the ark, did by the Lords appointment ſet it down, that ſo others might take it up, and they might be eaſed, at every ſuch reſting place, <hi>they offered ſeven bullocks and ſeven rammes.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Aſaph the chief,</hi> &amp;c.] Heman is named in the firſt place as chief of the three principall ſingers, chap. 6.33. but Aſaph it ſeems was the chief of thoſe that were deputed to this ſervice in the houſe of David, where the ark was now placed; the reſt being imployed at preſent in the Tabernacle at Gibeon, verſ. 39, 40. <hi>And Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok the prieſt, and his brethren the prieſts, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon, to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord, upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord which he commanded Iſrael:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Then on that day David delivered firſt this Pſalme to thank the Lord</hi> &amp;c.] That is, this was the firſt Pſalme he delivered them to ſing, the ſeverall parts whereof were afterward much enlarged by David, and reduced into ſeverall Pſalmes, as we may ſee Pſal. 105. and Pſal. 96.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Give thanks unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] From hence to the end of the two and twentieth verſe is the beginning of the hundred and fifth Pſalme, and the ſumme of it is, to praiſe God for the publick benefits afforded to his Church and people, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael; in regard whereof in times of any great joy Gods people uſed to ſing this Pſalme, as may be probably gathered from that which we reade, Iſa. 12.4. <hi>And in that day ſhall ye ſay, Praiſe the Lord, call upon his name,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Seek the Lord and his ſtrength, ſeek his face continually.]</hi> That is, ſeek to know and to aſſure unto your ſelves the Lord and his ſtrength, (by which you can onely hope to be ſtrengthened, defended, and delivered in times of trouble) and his favourable preſence; and that by reſorting to the ark, which is the outward ſigne of his preſence amongſt you, to counſell and inſtruct you (and therefore from thence he uſed to give his oracles, Exod. 25.22.) and to be your ſtrong fortreſſe and defence; in regard whereof the ark is elſewhere called, the ſtrength of God, Pſal. 78.61. <hi>And he delivered his ſtrength into captivity;</hi> and the ark of his ſtrength, Pſal. 132.8. <hi>Ariſe O Lord into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy ſtrength;</hi> yea, and this muſt be done with perſeverance, and therefore is the word <hi>continually</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>ſeek his face continually.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>O ye ſeed of Iſrael his ſervant,</hi> &amp;c.] Pſalm. 105.6. it is <hi>O ye ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and then, <hi>O ye children of Jacob his choſen ones,</hi> that is, his adopted and peculiar people, and that merely of Gods free grace and election.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Be ye mindfull alwayes of his covenant.]</hi> Pſal. 105.8. it is, <hi>He hath remembred his covenant for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The word which he commanded to a thouſand generations.]</hi> That is, the conditions of the covenant, which on Iſraels part was the law of faith and obedience, &amp; on Gods part the promiſes, which for the greater certainty may be alſo ſaid to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Pſal. 133.3. <hi>There the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>When ye were but few even a few,</hi> &amp;c.] Pſal. 105.12. it is, <hi>when they were but few:</hi> &amp; this is expreſſed, firſt, to imply the freedome of Gods grace in chooſing them to be his people, Deut. 7.7. ſecondly, to magnifie the more the Lords protecting them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And when they went from nation to nation,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, when they went up and down in the land of Canaan, where were ſeven mighty nations, Deut. 7.1. and ſometimes removed thence to other kingdomes, as to Egypt, Gen. 12.10. and Gerar, Gen. 20.1. for under this clauſe all the travels of the Patriarchies are comprehended.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Yea, he reproved kings for their ſakes.]</hi> As Pharaoh, Gen. 12.17. and Abimelech, Gen. 20.3.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.]</hi> That is, wrong not thoſe whom I have conſecrated to my ſelf by the anointing of my holy ſpirit (my Chriſtians) according to that 1. John 2.20. <hi>But ye have an unction from the holy one,</hi> &amp;c. and verſ. 27. <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you,</hi> &amp;c. to whom therefore I do familiarly reveal my will, that they may teach &amp; inſtruct others, Gen. 20.7. <hi>Reſtore therefore to the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he ſhall pray for thee, and thou ſhalt live,</hi> &amp;c. and thus the Prophet implies that the Lord did thus defend them, not onely becauſe they were poore helpleſſe miſerable men, unjuſtly oppreſſed; but alſo becauſe by ſpeciall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God had taken them into his protection.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Sing unto the Lord all the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] From hence to the 34. verſe is the ninety ſixth Pſalme, and the chief drift of it is to ſtirre up all nations to praiſe the Lord, and conſequently it includes a propheſie of Chriſt, and of the gathering of all nations into the Church by the preaching of the Goſpel: and therefore Pſal. 96.1. to expreſſe the ſtrange and unlooked for change that ſhould be then in the Church, theſe words, <hi>a new ſong,</hi> are added, <hi>and ſing unto the Lord a new ſong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Glory &amp; honour are in his preſence, ſtrength &amp; gladneſſe are in his place.]</hi> That is, God is a king of infinite majeſty, glory, and honour, moſt ſtrong and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the fountain of all ſtrength and gladneſſe to his people; ſuch his people find him in his ſanctuary where he reveals himſelf unto them, and ſuch therefore with glad hearts they acknowledge him to be, Pſal. 96.6. <hi>Honour and majestie are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, ſtrength and beauty are in his Sanctuary.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>Fear before him all the earth.]</hi> To wit, eſpecially when you preſent your ſelves before him in the aſſembly of his Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The world alſo ſhall be ſtable that it be not moved.]</hi> That is, this is the benefit that ſhall follow upon mens ſubjecting of themſelves to the government of God in Chriſt, that whereas by rebellion againſt God, the whole world tends to confuſion and ruine, by ſubmitting themſelves to Gods Sceptre all ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and the ſtate of the Church ſhall be unmoveable and eternall.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoyce?]</hi> So bleſſed and happie ſhall thoſe times be, and ſhall yield ſuch abundant matter of exceeding great joy, that if the very ſenſeleſſe creatures could ſhout and rejoyce it were well: for this is an hyperbolicall expreſſion of the bliſſe and joy of theſe times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And let men ſay among the nations, the Lord reigneth.]</hi> That is, the happineſſe of thoſe times ſhall be that men ſhall ſtoop to Gods Sceptre: which therfore it is fit men ſhould confeſſe to Gods glory; yea, and by publiſhing it to ſeek the drawing in of others, and ſo to enlarge the kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And ſay yee, Save us, O God of our ſalvation, and gather us together,</hi> &amp;c.] This may have reſpect, firſt, to the firm knitting together of the people that had been divided, ſome favouring Sauls poſterity, and ſome Davids: ſecondly, to the reducing of the captived Iſraelites to their own land, if at any time carried away (and ſo it is prophetically ſpoken) or thirdly, to the gathering of Gods elect out of all nations to be his people in the dayes of the Goſpel; and then the reaſon of this requeſt is added in the following words, <hi>that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praiſe,</hi> that is, in thy praiſe-worthy-works, or in our praiſing of thee: for indeed the faithfull ſervants of God do count it their happineſſe that they may praiſe God, and do therefore glory in it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. <hi>And with them Heman, and Jeduthun,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note before verſ. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To give thanks to the Lord, becauſe his mercy endureth for ever.]</hi> This laſt clauſe <hi>(becauſe his mercy endureth for ever)</hi> is therefore added, becauſe in many of their Pſalmes of praiſe, this was ſtill the foot of the ſong, as is evident, 2. Chron. 5.13. and 7.3. Ezra 3.11. Jer. 33.11. and in many other places.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>And with muſicall instruments of God.]</hi> That is, with holy muſicall inſtruments, ſuch as were ſet apart for the ſervice of God.</p>

that there he might offer up ſacrifices to appeaſe his wrath, but onely fell down and praied unto him; and alſo why the Lord did not ſend him to Gibeon to ſacrifice, when he meant to accept a ſacrifice for the ſtaying of the plague. Concerning which ſee the notes 1. Sam. 24.18.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen David ſaid, This is the houſe of our Lord God, and this is the altar,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, this is the place of which God ſpake long ſince by his ſervant Moſes, where he intended to have a houſe built which muſt be the ſettled place of his worſhip and ſervice, and where there muſt be an altar inſtead of this I have now ſet up; wherein onely they muſt offer up ſacrifices unto him, Deut. 12.11. <hi>There ſhall be a place which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe to cauſe his name to dwell there, thither ſhall you bring all that I command you, your burnt offerings and your ſacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. And this David knew, either by the diſcovery of the prophet Gad, who happely acquainted him with Gods purpoſe herein, or elſe thorough the ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods ſpirit, himſelf gathered ſo much from Gods ſending him to ſacrifice there, and from Gods miraculous teſtifying his acceptance of the ſervice there done him, by ſending fire from heaven to conſume the ſacrifice, chap. 21.26, 28.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And David commanded to gather together the ſtrangers that were in the land of Iſrael, and he ſet Maſons to hew,</hi> &amp;c.] And the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the help of ſtrangers, was a notable type of the calling of the Gentiles: As for David that ſet them on work, he had received from God the pattern whereby the Temple was to be built, and every part thereof, chap. 28.11, 12, 19. and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly therefore he prepared many materials, and ſet theſe workmen on work about them, to which Solomon afterward added what was not done, when he came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the work, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>For they were mighty men of valour.]</hi> The work of the porters was not onely to keep all unclean perſons from entring into the holy place; but alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all confuſion at the reſorting of the people on their ſolemne feſtivals to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they came in great multitudes, as alſo to be a guard to the holy place upon all other occaſions; and therefore it was requiſite that they ſhould be men of might and valour: and the ſonnes of Shemaiah being men eminent this way, they were appointed to be heads of the ſeverall diviſions and courſes of the porters.</p>

But may ſome ſay, being there were but eighteen of the ſonnes and brethren of Meſhelemiah verſ. 9. to whom by lot the charge of the eaſt gate fell, verſ. 14. how could there be in each of the twenty foure courſes ſome of the ſonnes and brethren of Meſhelemiah to take the charge of the eaſt gate: I anſwer; firſt, that thoſe eighteen of Meſhelemiahs ſonnes and brethren, verſ. 9. were happely the chief, and beſides theſe there were many more: yea, ſecondly, happely under the lot of Meſhelemiah many other Levites were comprehended, beſides his ſonnes and brethren, for there were of theſe porters foure thouſand in all, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter 23.5.</p>

It is generally held that there was no gate weſt-ward either into the court of the prieſts or the people; but yet out of the court of the Gentiles it ſeems there was a gate weſt-ward, and therefore it is expreſſely ſaid, chap. 9.24. <hi>In foure quarters were the porters toward the eaſt, weſt, north, and ſouth;</hi> and here that Shippim and Hoſah were deſigned by lot to be porters weſt-ward: we find no mention of this gate Shallecheth elſewhere in the Scripture: but that it was on the weſt ſide is clear by the words in this place, and that it was by <hi>the cauſey of the going up,</hi> which needs muſt be ſome cauſey on the weſt ſide whereby they went up to the Temple, and therefore could not be, as ſome think it was, that aſcent mentioned 1. Kings 10.5, which was doubtleſſe on the eaſt ſide towards the frontiſpice of the Temple, and becauſe the word Shalle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſignifieth <hi>caſting out,</hi> therefore it is held that out of this gate they uſed to caſt forth all their aſhes and ſweepings, &amp;c. out of the Temple. However, it ſeems clear by the words, that there was another gate weſt-ward, beſides this that was called Shallecheth, becauſe it is ſaid that the lot weſt-ward fell to Shuppim and Hoſah <hi>with the gate Shallecheth,</hi> ward againſt ward, whereby I conceive is meant that whileſt one company waited at the gate Shallecheth, another company waited at the other weſt gate, and this I take to be that which verſ. 18. is called Parbar, for there it is ſaid that Parbar was weſt ward, and that of theſe porters there ſtill waited <hi>foure at the cauſey,</hi> that is the gate Shallecheth which was by the cauſey, <hi>and two at Parbar.</hi>

It may be probably inferred that there were of the Izharites ſixteen hundred (which makes up the juſt number of the ſix thouſand Judges and Officers, mentioned chap. 23.4.) and that all theſe were employed (under Chenaniah the chief of them) within Jordan weſtward, becauſe otherwiſe there would be farre more employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the two tribes and a half without Jordan, then in all the land of Iſrael be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>A thouſand and ſeven hundred, were officers among them of Iſrael on this ſide Jordan weſtward, in all buſineſſe of the Lord, and in the ſervice of the king.]</hi> That is, in providing ſuch ſacrifices as the king offered (which were indeed many, upon many occaſions) <hi>or by the ſervice of the king,</hi> may be meant the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

To wit, becauſe being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided (as it were) from Gods people by the river Jordan, there was the more care requiſite to retain them in their obedience to the Law, and to prevent any back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or remiſſeneſſe in the worſhip of God at Jeruſalem, whither with the other Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites they were bound at certain times to reſort.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>NOw the children of Iſrael after their number,</hi> &amp;c.] As in the former chapters is ſhown, how David diſtributed the Prieſts and Levites into twenty foure courſes, ſo here we are told how the Militia of the kingdome were alſo divided into twelve courſes, twenty foure thouſand in each courſe, who in their turns one moneth in the yeare, were ſtill in arms ready to be imployed in any ſervice for the State, as the king ſhould appoint them: by which means all the able men of the kingdome were ſtill trained up to be expert in the uſe of their arms, and there was alwayes a ſufficient number ready in arms, if on a ſudden there ſhould be any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make uſe of them: neither was it any great burthen to the people though for that moneth they bore their own charges, becauſe all the reſt of the yeare they were free to follow their own employments.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Of the children of Perez, was the chief of all the captains of the hoſt for the firſt moneth.]</hi> To wit, Jaſhobeam of whom in the former verſe, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo chief of Davids Worthies. See chap. 11.11. It ſeems he was of the poſteritie of Perez or Pharez the ſonne of Judah, Gen, 46.12. and therefore he had the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of being commander in chief over the firſt courſe, and it may be had ſome command over the captains in the other courſes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And of his courſe was Mikloth alſo the ruler.]</hi> To wit, after the death of Dodai. Some underſtand that he was Dodai his Lieutenant; but why then is not the Lieutenant of every courſe and company likewiſe named? Rather therefore I conceive, that Mikloth was the captain of this courſe after Dodai, as is ſaid of Zeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah, verſ. 7. that he was captain the fourth moneth after his father Aſahel was dead, who died in the beginning of Davids reigne.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>The third captain of the hoſt for the third moneth, was Benaiah the ſonne of Jehoiadae a chief priest.]</hi> If the words be read as it is in the margin <hi>(the ſonne of Jehoiada a principall officer)</hi> there is no difficulty at all in them; but if we

read them as in our text <hi>(the ſonne of Jehoiada a chief prieſt)</hi> by <hi>the ſonne of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada,</hi> muſt be meant the ſonne in law of Jehoiada: for it is not likely that the prieſts were in ordinary courſe captains and commanders of Davids bands of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, though ſometimes indeed upon extraordinary occaſions it is evident that the prieſts did arm themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Theſe were the princes of the tribes of Iſrael.]</hi> That is, theſe were the heads of the tribes, who had chief power in the civil government. The Princes of Gad and Aſher are not here expreſſed, perhaps becauſe the Gadites and the Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites, or the half tribe of Manaſſeh without Jordan, had but one Prince over them both, and ſo likewiſe the children of Aſher might be joyned with ſome tribe that bordered upon them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under.]</hi> Having ſet down the Princes of the tribes, it might be expected that in the next place ſhould be ſet down the number of each tribe that were under theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: eſpecially becauſe the people had been ſo lately numbred by David. In anſwer whereto therefore this clauſe is inſerted, and two things concerning this are affirmed: Firſt, that David gave order to number onely thoſe of twenty years old and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and that becauſe <hi>the Lord had ſaid he would increaſe Iſrael like to the ſtarres of the heavens,</hi> and ſo David would not attempt to have them ſo numbred, to wit, becauſe he would not ſeem to queſtion the truth of that promiſe; and withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did indeed think it would be an endleſſe and tedious work. And ſecondly, verſ. 24. <hi>Joab the ſonne of Zeruiah began to number, but finiſhed not, becauſe there fell wrath for it against Iſrael,</hi> to wit, becauſe the plague being begun, he ſaw the work was diſpleaſing to God, and ſo gave it over, chap. 21.6. <hi>But Levi and Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min counted he not: for the kings word was abominable to Joab.</hi>

                     <hi>I had in my heart to build an houſe of reſt for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God.]</hi> That is, the ark, or the propitiatory, or mercy-ſeat wherewith the ark was covered: for elſewhere alſo we find the ark term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods footſtool, as Pſal. 99.5. <hi>Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worſhip at his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool:</hi> and Pſal. 132.7. <hi>We will go into his tabernacle, we will worſhip at his footſtool.</hi> And the reaſons why the ark is ſo called, may be firſt, becauſe the Lord being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſitting between the wings of the Cherubims as in a throne, the body of the ark was in that reſpect in ſtead of a footſtool to him: and ſecondly, to intimate how they ought to judge of Gods preſence there in a ſpirituall manner; that the people might not entertain any carnall and earthly conceits of Gods preſence there, not conſonant to the infinite glory and majeſty of God: the ark is called Gods footſtool, ſo to raiſe their thoughts of God above the world, and to teach them ſo to conceive of Gods preſence in the ark, as withall to acknowledge that he dwelleth on high, and filleth heaven and earth with his glory; yea, that <hi>the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him,</hi> 1. Kings 8.27.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Howbeit, the Lord God of Iſrael choſe me before all the houſe of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be king over Iſrael for ever.]</hi> To wit, in my poſterity: and this was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in Chriſt. See Luke 1.32, 33.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Even the weight for the candleſticks of gold.]</hi> For the holy place were theſe candleſticks made: for though there was but one candleſtick in the tabernacle of Moſes, yet in the Temple there were ten candleſticks of pure gold for the holy place, 1. Kings 7.49. As for the candleſticks of ſilver here alſo mentioned, they were doubtleſſe for the porch of the courts, and happely alſo for the chambers that were about the courts.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And by weight he gave gold for the tables of ſhew-bread,</hi> &amp;c.] For in the temple there were ſeverall tables of ſhew-bread, 2. Chron. 4.19. As for the ſilver tables here mentioned alſo, they were for the chambers of the Prieſts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the temple.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And gold for the pattern of the chariot of the Cherubims,</hi> &amp;c.] This muſt needs be meant, not of the two Cherubims that were upon the Mercy-ſeat, one at each end (for they were made in Moſes time, and now carried by Solomon into the Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but of thoſe two greater Cherubims made by Solomons appointment of Olive wood, and covered over with plates of gold, and that to ſtand before the ark, to hide and cover it even from the eyes of the high Prieſt, when he came into the moſt holy place, 1. Kings 6.23. And it is called <hi>the chariot of the Cherubims,</hi> not onely becauſe it was the repreſentation of Gods preſence there attended with his holy Angels, who are called the Lords chariots: Pſal. 68.17. <hi>The chariots of God are twenty thouſand, even thouſands of Angels:</hi> but alſo happely becauſe there was

in theſe Cherubims thus ſtanding before the ark, ſome reſemblance of the chariots uſed in thoſe times; yea and ſome adde, that hereby was ſignified alſo that Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the ark was not ſo fixed amongſt them, but that he would leave them if his people ſhould too farre provoke him by their ſinnes.</p>

<pb n="701" facs="tcp:42229:359"/>
firſt, becauſe the making of Zadok the ſole high prieſt inſtead of Abiathar, is here joyned with it, and it cannot be denied but that was done after Davids death, 1. Kings 2.35. ſecondly, becauſe it followeth in the next verſe, <hi>that Solomon ſate on the throne as king inſtead of his father David:</hi> thirdly, becauſe when David made theſe things known in a publick aſſembly of his Princes, he was not yet bed-rid, chap. 18.1, 2. ſo that Adonijahs attempting to make himſelf king (at which time Solomon was firſt anointed, 1. Kings 1.33, 34.) was after this. And laſt of all, becauſe it followeth verſ. 24. that the other ſonnes of David ſubmitted themſelves to Solomon, which was not till Adonijahs uſurpation was defeated, 1. Kings 1.9.49.50.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Then Solomon ſate on the throne of the Lord.]</hi> All kingdomes and thrones are the Lords, becauſe all kings are the Lords vice-gerents, and have their power from him; but the throne of the kingdome of Iſrael is upon more peculiar grounds called the throne of the Lord; to wit, firſt, becauſe the diſpoſing of this throne the Lord wholly challenged to himſelf, Deut. 17.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him king over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe:</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe the kings of Judah were figures of Chriſt the true anointed, to whom the throne of David was promiſed, that is, that he ſhould be king of the Iſrael of God for ever, Luke 1.33. <hi>And he ſhall reigne over the houſe of Jacob for ever,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And he died in a good old age.]</hi> To wit, when he was ſeventy years old; for David <hi>was thirty years old when he began to reigne, and he reigned fourty years,</hi> 2. Sam. 5.4.</p>

And he calls the ark, the ark of Gods ſtrength, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where it is called Gods ſtrength and glory, Pſal. 78.61. <hi>He delivered his ſtrength into captivity, and his glory into the enemies hand,</hi> becauſe it was the ſigne of Gods preſence amongſt them, as their ſtrength and defence, which had been manifeſted by many mighty works which the Lord had wrought, as it were by the preſence of the ark; as the dividing of Jordan, and the fall of the walls of Jericho, &amp;c.

                     <hi>Let thy prieſts, O Lord, be clothed with ſalvation, and let thy ſaints rejoyce in goodneſſe.]</hi> The firſt clauſe may be underſtood two ſeverall wayes, either of Gods ſaving and preſerving the prieſts, <hi>Let thy prieſts, O Lord, be clothed with ſalvation,</hi> that is, let thy ſalvation be as a garment to defend them, or as a robe to adorn them, (for it is indeed an honour and glory to men, that the great God of heaven and earth ſhould make ſuch precious account of them, as to be alwayes watchfull over them to preſerve and ſave them) or elſe of the preſervation and ſalvation of the whole people, this being a decking and glorious ornament to the prieſts, that they ſtood as typicall mediatours betwixt God and them, and were the inſtrumentall meanes of their preſervation and, ſalvation; even as it is now the glory of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, that they are the meanes of ſaving ſoules: whence it is, that S.

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>For he ſaid, My wife ſhall not dwell in the houſe of David,</hi> &amp;c.] In the foregoing words it is ſaid, <hi>that Solomon brought up the daughter of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh out of the city of David, unto the houſe that he had built for her:</hi> and here the reaſon given for this is, <hi>for he ſaid, My wife ſhall not dwell in the houſe of David king of Iſrael;</hi> and why ſo? <hi>Becauſe the places are holy whereunto the ark of the Lord hath come:</hi> Concerning which, a queſtion of great difficulty may be moved, to wit, why the houſe of David ſhould be counted ſo holy, that Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons wife might not be ſuffered to dwell there? and that even after the ark was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready removed thence into the Temple: we reade not any where elſe that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ark made any place holy any longer then it continued there; (for was the houſe of Obed-edom holy after the ark was carried from thence?) yet here

thirteen years after the ark was carryed into the Temple, (for ſo long it was after the finiſhing of the Temple, ere Solomon had built his own houſe, and the queens houſe, 1. Kings 7.1.) Solomon refuſed to let his wife dwell in Davids houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ark had been there; yea, the words ſeem to imply, that all places were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed holy where the ark had been, <hi>the places are holy</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>whereunto the ark of the Lord hath come.</hi> But for reſolving of this, two anſwers may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Firſt, that thoſe words, <hi>for he ſaid, My wife ſhall not dwell in the houſe of David king of Iſrael, becauſe the places are holy,</hi> &amp;c. contain the reaſon why Solomon reſolved to build an houſe for his wife (at which time the ark was yet in the houſe of David) not why he brought up his wife into the houſe he had built for her, when indeed the ark had been long before removed into the Temple, and ſo muſt be referred to the words immediately foregoing <hi>(the houſe that he had built for her) Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, unto the houſe that he had huilt for her:</hi> and then to ſhew, what moved him to build an houſe for her, this clauſe is added, <hi>for he ſaid, My wife ſhall not dwell in the houſe of David king of Iſrael, becauſe the places are holy whereunto the ark of the Lord hath come.</hi> Or ſecondly, that Solomon reſolved that becauſe the places were holy, whereunto the ark was brought, therefore it was not fit that his wife who was born of heathen parents, and had not her ſelf perhaps at that time, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the faith of Iſrael, ſhould dwell in the houſe which had been holy in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: though Davids houſe ceaſed to be holy after the ark was removed thence, in regard of the Symbolicall ſigne of Gods preſence, yet out of his ſuperabundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto that ſigne of Gods preſence, he thought it not fit to make that a dwelling place for her and her followers, that were aliens and ſtrangers to the houſe of Iſrael, which had been the holy dwelling place of the moſt high God: and this I conceive to be the beſt and moſt ſatisfying anſwer.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>For Jeroboam and his ſonnes had caſt them off from executing the priests office unto the Lord.]</hi> To wit, by forbidding them to go up to Jeruſalem to execute the prieſts office in the Temple, as by the Law they were enjoyned: and this is aſcribed not onely to Jeroboam, but alſo to his ſonnes, becauſe he uſed them as his inſtruments in reſtraining them from going up to ſacrifice at the Temple, having happely given them the charge and command of the fenced cities, as Rehoboam did his ſonnes, verſ. 23.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he ordained him prieſts for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.]</hi> Hereby it appears that Jeroboam ſet up other idols beſides his golden calves, in which he pretended the worſhip of the true God, and why he ſaid in them to have ſerved devils, ſee Levit. 17.7.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>So they ſtrengthened the kingdome of Judah, and made Rehoboam the ſonne of Solomon ſtrong, three years.]</hi> That is, by the acceſſe of theſe Levites and others of the ten tribes the kingdome of Judah was ſtrengthened, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued three years. Indeed till the fifth yeare Shiſhak invaded not the land of Judah, chap. 12.2. But in the fourth yeare they began to corrupt themſelves; and becauſe ſo ſoon as they forſook God, God alſo forſook them, therefore even then are they counted as a weakned people, their defence being then departed from them: as was evident in the preparations which Shiſhak immediately made againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.]</hi> To wit, before
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:42229:363"/>
his fall, and after his repentance: for by this place amongſt others, it appears that Solomon before his death repented him of his idolatry, and turned unto the Lord, though he could not ſo ſoon purge the land of thoſe idolatrous monuments which himſelf had raiſed; as it was with Manaſſeh, chap. 33.18. For it is not likely that the beginning of Rehoboams reigne would have been David-like, if Solomon had died and left the kingdome in ſo corrupt a condition. Yet ſome conceive that Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is here joyned with David, becauſe himſelf continued incorrupt from idolatry, though he ſuffered high places to be ſet up for his wives.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18, <hi>And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jeremoth,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Rehoboam had eighteen wives, verſ. 21. yet three of them onely are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by name: the third, becauſe he had by her Abijah who ſucceeded him in the throne, and the firſt two onely to make way to the mention of the third, becauſe he married them firſt, and then afterward took the third to wife, to wit, Maachah the daughter of Abiſhalom the mother of Abijah. Concerning whom, ſee the notes, 1. Kings 15.2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Rehoboam made Abijah the ſonne of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he gave him the preheminency in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects above his brethren, as intending that he ſhould ſucceed him in the throne.

                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And he dealt wiſely, and diſperſed all his children throughout all the countreys of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced citie.]</hi> The wiſdome and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of Rehoboam in diſperſing his other ſonnes into the ſeverall fenced cities in the out-skirts of his kingdome was this, that hereby they were kept, either from variance amongſt themſelves, or from conſulting together againſt their brother Abijah, and perhaps under a pretence of honouring them with the charge of thoſe places, were little better then priſoners there, under the eye of ſome that were appointed to watch over them; (for indeed otherwiſe there would have been little policie in putting the ſtrong places of the kingdome into their hands) to which purpoſe alſo it was (as I conceive) that the better to content them, he allowed them moſt liberall and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintenance in all regards, which is implyed in the following clauſe, <hi>he gave them victualls in abundance.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And Nation was deſtroyed of nation,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in the warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the kingdome of Judah and the kingdome of Iſrael; wherein they alſo made uſe of the auxilliary forces of other nations.</p>

As for that which is ſaid, that when Aſa had heard theſe words, and this propheſie, <hi>he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land,</hi> &amp;c. we ſee that he had in a great part done this before, chap. 14.3. but it ſeems now upon a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearch made throughout his kingdome, he put away the remainder of the idols that were found amongſt them; and that not onely <hi>out of the land of Judah and Benjamin,</hi> but alſo <hi>out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim,</hi> which may be meant of the cities which his father Abijam had taken, chap. 13.19. but yet there is mention made of cities of Ephraim which Aſa himſelf took, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter 17.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And renewed the altar of the Lord.]</hi> That is, the altar which Solomon had built, having ſome way loſt its beautie in ſo many years (which is no wonder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how continually it was uſed and ſtood in the open court) he renewed it,
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:42229:365"/>
and beautified it again; and then in a ſolemne manner obſerved again ſacrifices thereon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the ſtrangers with them out of Ephraim and Manaſſeh, and out of Simeon.]</hi> Hereby it is manifeſt that even the tribe of Simeon did revolt from the kingdome of Judah, or at leaſt the greateſt part of them, however they had their inheritance within the portion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Joſh 19.1. and that therefore either they removed from their firſt habitation, and tranſplanted themſelves amongſt other tribes of Iſrael: or elſe that they ſtood out againſt Judah, and clave to the party of the other tribes, yea, though they had their dwelling within Judahs portion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>So they gathered themſelves together at Jeruſalem in the third moneth, in the fifteenth yeare of the reigne of Aſa.]</hi> Which was the twelfth of Baaſha king of Iſrael. By this it appears that Zerah the Ethiopian did not invade the land of Judah, till the fourteenth yeare of Aſa. Indeed Aſa lived in peace but ten years, chap. 14.1. But it was therefore Baaſha king of Iſrael not Zerah, that immediately after thoſe ten years were ended, made warre againſt Aſa. As for the third moneth, it was that wherein the feaſt of Pentecoſt was kept.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd Jehoſhaphat his ſonne reigned in his stead, and ſtrengthened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt Iſrael.]</hi> In the latter dayes of Aſa, after he fell into thoſe grievous ſinnes mentioned in the former chapter, the kings of Iſrael (as God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, chap. 16.9.) did it ſeems in their ſeverall times renew their warres againſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, to wit, Baaſha, Omri, and Ahab, and had happely often the better of them; but about the third or fourth yeare of Ahab, Aſa dying, 1. Kings 22.41. Jehoſhaphat ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, and making great preparations to withſtand them, he was greatly ſtrengthened againſt the kingdome of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the Lord was with Jehoſhaphat, becauſe he walked in the first wayes of his father David.]</hi> Which were purer and freer from ſinne then were his latter dayes: for whileſt he was in continuall troubles, we reade not any ſuch foul ſinnes he fell into, as afterwards being ſettled in his kingdome, when he committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with Uriahs wife, and many other wayes tranſgreſſed Gods Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſought not unto Baalim.]</hi> To wit, as did Ahab at this time king of Iſrael: whether by Baalim we underſtand all falſe Gods in generall, or in particular the the idols of Baal, the God of the Sydonians, 1. Kings 16.31, 32. for that theſe words are ſpoken by way of comparing of Jehoſhaphat to Ahab, we may ſee by that which follows, verſ. 4. <hi>But ſought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And his heart was lifted up in the wayes of the Lord.]</hi> That is, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came zealous, and very couragious in Gods cauſe, and went forward with an high, and magnanimous ſpirit, without any baſeneſſe, fear, or carnall reſpects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover, he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.]</hi> The high places, whereon the God of Iſrael was worſhipped, though contrary to his Law,
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:42229:366"/>
were not by Jehoſhaphat taken away, chap. 20.33. and therefore this muſt be meant of ſuch high places and groves, wherein they worſhipped idol-gods. Theſe indeed Aſa his father had taken away, chap. 14.3. but it ſeems in the latter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining dayes of Aſa, when he lay ſick, ſome of the people that lingred ſtill after their former idolatry, made uſe of the advantage of theſe times, and did ſecretly ſet up their high places and groves again: and theſe they were that Jehoſhaphat after ſearch made did now take away.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And in the third yeare of his reigne, he ſent to his princes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to teach in the cities of Judah.]</hi> To ſee that they were taught. We may not think, that at other times the people of God did now live in the kingdome of Judah without any ordinary teaching; but becauſe he found that the people were in many places ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to idolatry (as having ſet up their high places, which his father Aſa had pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down) theſe choice prieſts and Levites mentioned, verſ. 8. were ſent as viſitours into the ſeverall parts of his kingdome, to ſee whether they were truely taught, and by their own perſonall teaching, both to confirm thoſe that were rightly inſtructed, and to convince thoſe that were corrupt, and to ſhew them how expreſſely the Law did forbid, and threaten all idolatry whatſoever. And with them theſe princes were ſent to countenance, and incourage them, and happely to puniſh thoſe that ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, or that ſhould be found obſtinate in their errours.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And the men of warre, mighty men of valour, were in Jeruſalem.]</hi> That is, his Generalls, and captains, and ſome companies of their ſouldiers ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with them.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>There cometh a great multitude againſt thee from beyond the ſea, on this ſide Syria.]</hi> That is, the dead ſea, which lay betwixt Judah and Syria: and becauſe they came from thoſe parts, ſome Expoſitours conceive it to be very probable, that Jehoſhaphats aiding of Ahab in his warres againſt the Syrians, chap. 18. was the firſt occaſion of this invaſion of his land.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And Jehoſhaphat ſtood in the congregation of Judah and Jeruſalem, in the houſe of the Lord before the new court.]</hi> Some Expoſitours underſtand this of a new court added of late years to the Temple, for thoſe that were ſtrangers and unclean amongſt the Iſraelites to worſhip God in: but becauſe of this we have no mention at all in the Scriptures, it is better by others expounded of the court of the prieſts, which Solomon built; and that it is here called <hi>the new court,</hi> becauſe it was of late newly repaired and beautified, and that happely by Aſa when the altar of burnt offerings was alſo renewed, chap. 18.8. Others again underſtand it of the court of the people, and that this had been lately repaired, and perhaps divided into two courts, the one being appointed for the men and the other for the women (as it is generally held, that though at firſt when Solomon built it it was but one court, yet afterwards it was divided into two) or that having been ever ſince the revolt of the ten tribes alienated to other uſes (becauſe then there was no uſe of ſo large a court as was provided for the meeting of the twelve tribes) now upon the coming in of ſo many of the ten tribes to the kingdome of Judah, it was opened and reſtored again to the ſervice of the Temple. But becauſe it is moſt probable that Jehoſhaphat ſtood to pray amongſt the people upon the braſen ſcaffold which Solomon had built, 2. Chron. 6.13. which was in the court of the people, therefore I rather think this <hi>new court</hi> before which he ſtood, was the prieſts court newly repaired.</p>

and ſo they might be rendred the more ſerious and vehement in their prayers, and more couragious in withſtanding the enemy, when they ſhould come to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.

For Hazael king of Syria (as it is related, 2. Kings 12.17.) invaded the land, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken Gath addreſſed himſelf to Jeruſalem, having ſufficient pretence for what he did (if his ambition cared for pretence) becauſe the kings of Judah had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted the Iſraelites againſt the Syrians at Ramoth Gilead: and ſo formidable to Joaſh was this approch of Hazael towards Jeruſalem, that he took all the hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treaſures of the Temple, and in his own houſe, and with that preſent purchaſed his peace. Some conceive that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of Hazael (mentioned in the Kings) is the ſame with that inrode of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſpoken of, verſ 23. of this chapter, but that cannot be: for this was before the ſlaying of Zachariah, verſ. 20. that after it, verſ. 23. in this the matter was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded without a battel, in that a battel was fought to Joaſh his great loſſe, verſ. 24. in this Hazael was preſent, 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And the ſpirit of God came upon Zechariah the ſonne of Jehoiada the priest,</hi> &amp;c.] It is a great queſtion amongſt Expoſitours, whether this were that Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah of whom our Saviour ſpake, Matth. 23.35. <hi>From the bloud of righteous Abel unto the bloud of Zacharias ſonne of Barachias, whom ye ſlew,</hi> &amp;c. Moſt conceive it is, and that becauſe this Zechariah was ſlain by the Jews, and that (as is expreſſed in the following verſe) <hi>in the court of the houſe Lord:</hi> nor do we reade in Scripture of any other Zechariah that was ſo ſlain: for though this was <hi>the ſonne of Jehoiada,</hi> and that Zachariah of whom Chriſt ſpeaks, is expreſſely called there <hi>the ſonne of Barachias;</hi> yet to this it may be anſwered, that Jehoiada was ſo called Barachias; or that he is called Barachias, which ſignifies <hi>the bleſſed of the Lord,</hi> becauſe he was in his time ſuch a bleſſed inſtrument of ſo much good to the people of God: and it may well be the drift of Chriſts words, to ſhew that the bloud of all that were long ago ſlain, ſhould be charged upon that generation, and ſo in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard this Zechariah is joyned there with Abel. But now others hold that it is not this Zechariah of whom our Saviour ſpeaks there, but that Zachariah which is laſt but one of the ſmall Prophets, that was raiſed up of God to encourage the people that were come back from Babylon to rebuild the Temple. And indeed, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Zachariah is expreſſely called <hi>the ſonne of Barachiah,</hi> Zach. 1.1. as it were purpoſely to diſtinguiſh him from this Zechariah the ſonne of Jehoiada. And ſecondly, becauſe the words of our Saviour ſeem rather to imply that all the bloud of Gods righteous ſervants, ſlain in former times, from the firſt to the laſt, ſhould be charged upon them; and ſo Abel is mentioned as the firſt, and Zachariah as the laſt, I cannot ſee but that very probably it may be underſtood of that Zachariah, and that he after the reedifying of the Temple, flying to the altar for Sanctuary, when the Jews were for ſome cauſe enraged againſt him, was there ſlain, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>between the Temple and the altar.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, according to all that his father Uzziah did.]</hi> That is, he did that which was right, but not with a perfect heart: and therefore it follows in the next words (to ſhew that yet he was not altogether ſo ill as his father) that <hi>he entered not into the Temple,</hi> to wit, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer incenſe, and to incroach upon the prieſts office, as his father did.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>AHaz was twenty years old when he began to reigne, and he reigned ſixteen years in Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] See many ſeverall notes for this chapter in 2. Kings 16.2. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>But are there not with you, even with you, ſinnes againſt the Lord your God?]</hi> That is, ſince God hath delivered the men of Judah into your hands becauſe of their ſinnes, and that you cannot but know that you alſo have given the Lord as juſt cauſe to have puniſhed you, the conſideration hereof ſhould have moved you to ſhew them mercy, and not to have exerciſed ſuch horrible cruelty againſt them, as you have done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>At that time did king Ahaz ſend unto the kings of Aſſyria to help him.]</hi> That is, the king of Aſſyria that had many kings under him. After that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin king of Syria, and Pekah king of Iſrael had ſeverally made inrodes into the land of Judah, as is above related, verſ: 5, 6. &amp;c. and had made great ſpoil in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, not content with this they reſolved to joyn their forces together, and to go up againſt Ahaz again, and beſiege Jeruſalem, as is related, 2. Kings 16.5. and this combination of theſe two kings it was, accompanied with the loſſe he ſuſtained at the ſame time by the Edomites and Philiſtines, verſ. 17, 18. that made him ſend to the king of Aſſyria for help; of which ſee 2. Kings 16.7.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>For the Lord brought Judah low, becauſe of Ahaz king of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, king of Judah. See the note on chap, 21.2.</p>

Kings 16.6. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe when he did come forth to his help, though he did indeed ſorely afflict both the Syrians and the Iſraelites, yet he reſtored not to Ahaz any of the cities which his enemies had taken from him, nor did him any other good in recompence of the great treaſures which Ahaz had given him, but perhaps did other wayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe him, therefore it is here ſaid, <hi>he diſtreſſed him, but helped him not.</hi> As for that phraſe, <hi>he made Judah naked,</hi> ſee the note, Exod. 32.35.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>For he ſacrificed to the gods of Damaſcus, which ſmote him,</hi> &amp;c.] The occaſion whereof was a journey he took to Damaſcus to meet with Tiglath-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſer king of Aſſyria, and to congratulate his vanquiſhing of Rezin: for there he took up that reſolution of ſacrificing to <hi>the gods of Damaſcus which ſmote him,</hi> to wit, in that expedition of Rezin king of Damaſcus againſt Judah, whereof mention is made before, verſ. 5. and to that end ſent the pattern of an altar he had ſeen there to Uriah the prieſt, according to which he built an altar, which was placed in the Temple, and thereon did Ahaz ſacrifice to theſe heathen gods, 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>HEzekiah began to reigne when he was five and twenty years old,</hi> &amp;c.] Viz. in the third yeare of Hoſhea. See the notes, 2. Kings 18.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>He in the firſt yeare of his reigne, in the first moneth, opened the doores of the houſe of the Lord.]</hi> And in the firſt day of the moneth: for then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they began to cleanſe the Temple, verſ. 17.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And gathered them together in the eaſt-ſtreet.]</hi> That is, the ſtreet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eaſt-gate, the chief gate of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord, and turned their backs.]</hi> That is, they have openly, baſely, and opprobriouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the worſhip of God in his Temple. The like expreſſion we have Jer. 2.27. <hi>They have turned their back unto me, and not their face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And on the eighth day of the moneth came they to the porch of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in eight dayes they purged and ſanctified the Temple it ſelf, the moſt holy, and the holy place, and the porch before the holy place they began with, or came to on the eighth day; and then in eight dayes more they purged the courts and chambers thereof, and ſo made an end on the ſixteenth day of the firſt moneth: and all this is noted to imply, what a deal of idolatrous traſh Ahaz had brought into the Temple, when they were ſo many dayes imployed in the removing and caſting it out, and ſetting all things in order as they were in former times.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And they brought ſeven bullocks and ſeven rammes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they brought all kind of clean beaſts appointed for ſacrifice, ſome for the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Temple, &amp;c. ſome for ſinne offerings, ſome for burnt offerings, and ſome for peace offerings; and ſeven they brought of each ſort, to ſignifie the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the ſacrifice, that it was for the whole kingdome, the prince, and all the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="725" facs="tcp:42229:371"/>Verſ. 23. <hi>And they brought forth the he-goats for the ſinne offering,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, the ſeven he-goats mentioned verſ. 21. In Levit. 4.13. the law enjoyneth a young bullock to be offered for a ſinne-offering for the congregation; but that was for the expiation of ſome one particular ſinne, whereof through ignorance the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation might be guilty; and now the expiation was to be made for all the many ſinnes, whereof the whole land, both king and people were guilty; in which caſe they were not tyed to that law, in Levit. 4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And they made reconciliation with their bloud upon the altar, to make an attonement for all Iſrael.]</hi> That is, not onely for the kingdome of Judah, but alſo for the brethren of the ten tribes, who had been ſorely of late oppreſſed by the Aſſyrians; which was the reaſon why Hezekiah gave expreſſe charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Now ye have conſecrated your ſelves unto the Lord, come near and bring ſacrifices,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Let the people now bring in their ſacrifices, or do you, O prieſts, bring in the peoples ſacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>And the conſecrated things were ſix hundred oxen, and three thouſand ſheep.]</hi> That is, the other ſacrifices of ſeverall ſorts, to wit, peace-offerings, and free-will-offerings, were <hi>ſix hundred oxen, and three thouſand ſheep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>But the prieſts were too few, ſo that they could not ſlay all the burnt-offerings.]</hi> Which was properly the work of the prieſts onely, Levit. 1.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Levites were more upright in heart to ſanctifie themſelves, then the prieſts.]</hi> That is, they were more forward to ſanctifie themſelves then the prieſts were; and ſo there were more of them ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>And alſo the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, theſe things (beſides the burnt-offerings) were to be offered on the altar; ſo that the prieſts being but few, had not leaſure to ſlay all the ſacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>For the thing was done ſuddenly.]</hi> It was evident that God had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily enclined the hearts of the people to this reformation, becauſe it was done ſo ſuddenly.</p>

Kings 15.29.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>The king had taken counſel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jeruſalem, to keep the paſſeover in the ſecond moneth.]</hi> See Numb. 9.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>For they could not keep it at that time, becauſe the prieſts had not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified themſelves ſufficiently,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, when they ſhould have kept it; that is, the foureteenth day of the firſt moneth: for the Temples purgation was not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed till the ſixteenth day, chap. 29.17. <hi>And in the ſixteenth day of the firſt moneth they made an end.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>He will return to the remnant of you, that have eſcaped out of the hand of the king of Aſſyria.]</hi> To wit, out of the hands of Pul, and Tiglath-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſer,
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:42229:372"/>
for both theſe kings already carryed away many of the ten tribes into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but the laſt captivity under Shalmaneſer, (as is moſt likely) had not yet been.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And they aroſe, and took away the altars that were in Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by the kings encouragement, and at this time alſo the braſen ſerpent which Moſes made was broken in pieces, 2. ſee Kings 18.4. This was done in Jeruſalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they kept the Paſſeover: how they proceeded afterwards after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in other places, we ſee chap. 3.11. <hi>Now when all this was finiſhed, all Iſrael that were preſent, went out to the cities of Iudah, and brake the images in pieces,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the priests and the Levites were aſhamed, and ſanctified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the prieſts and Levites that had been hitherto remiſſe, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their own negligence, when they ſaw the forwardneſſe of the people, and ſo ſanctified themſelves, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>The prieſts ſprinkled the bloud, which they received of the hands of the Levites.]</hi> To wit, the bloud of the ſacrifices upon the altar, as was accuſtomed in all ſacrifices, Levit. 1.5. <hi>And he ſhall kill the bullocks before the Lord, and the prieſts Aarons ſonnes, ſhall bring the bloud, and ſprinkle the bloud round about,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>For there were many in the congregation that were not ſanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the paſſeover,</hi> &amp;c. By the paſſeovers here are meant (as I conceive) the ſacrifices which by the law were to be offered at the feaſt of the Paſſeover, and did accompany the eating of the Paſchall lambe, as Deut. 16.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt therefore ſacrifice the paſſeover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and heard,</hi> called elſewhere <hi>the paſſeover-offerings,</hi> chap. 35.7, 8. <hi>And Joſiah gave to the people of the flock lambes and kids for the paſſeover-offerings,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe ſacrifices were to be killed according to the rule of the law by the prieſts onely, Levit. 1.5. Here therefore a reaſon is given why at this time the Levites had the charge of killing them, namely, becauſe there were ſo many of the people that were not ſanctified but were unclean; and conſequently, there were ſo many ſacrifices to be offered for their purifying and cleanſing, that the prieſts alone could not do the work, and therefore the Levites were imployed therein.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manaſſeh, Iſſachar, and Zebulun had not cleanſed themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though the Levites did help the prieſts, as is before ſaid, yet very many of the Iſraelites did eat the Paſſeover being not purified from their uncleanneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.]</hi> That is, he ſanctified them by his ſpirit in an extraordinary way; or, he did not puniſh them, but forgive them that their infirmity, and accepted them as if they had been purified.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And Hezekiah ſpake comfortably to all the Levites, that taught the good knowledge of the Lord.]</hi> That is, he encouraged them in their work, and gave them hope of Gods mercy to the people, as concerning thoſe that had eaten the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over and were not cleanſed according to the Law.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And a great number of the priests ſanctified themſelves.]</hi> To wit, that were not before ſanctified, ſee verſ. 3. and chap. 29.34.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>For ſince the time of Solomon the ſonne of David king of Iſrael,
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:42229:372"/>
there was not the like in Jeruſalem.]</hi> That is, ſince the Iſraelites were divided from Judah and Benjamin.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Then the prieſts the Levites aroſe, and bleſſed the people, and their voice was heard,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Lord heard their prayer, and bleſſed them as was promiſed, Numb. 6.27. <hi>And they ſhall put my name upon the children of Iſrael, and I will bleſſe them.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>NOw when all this was finiſhed, all Iſrael that were preſent, went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces,</hi> &amp;c.] See chap. 30.14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In Ephraim alſo and Manaſſeh, untill they had utterly destroyed them all.]</hi> To wit, in thoſe cities of Ephraim and Manaſſeh that had been taken in the warres by the kings of Judah from the kings of Iſrael: for all this was done by the authority and command of Hezekiah. See 2. Kings 18.4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And Hezekiah appointed the courſes of the priests, and the Levites,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to minister, and to give thanks, and to praiſe in the gates of the tents of the Lord.]</hi> That is, in the Temple, called the <hi>tents of the lord,</hi> becauſe there the prieſts and Levites (who for their ſeverall functions number and order are called an army or hoſt, Levit. 4.3.) kept the watch of the Lord, and there the people aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in troops as ſouldiers in the camp, and that to pray unto the Lord, which is the chief ſervice of our ſpirituall warfare.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>He appointed alſo the kings portion of his ſubſtance, for the burnt-offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings,</hi> &amp;c.] All the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſacrifices here mentioned <hi>as is written in the law of the Lord,</hi> that is, which in the law were ſeverally preſcribed for every feaſt, and for the daily ſacrifice, Num. 28. they were ordinarily provided by the people in generall, as it was alſo afterward, Nehem. 10.32, 33. <hi>Alſo we made ordinances for us to charge our ſelves yearely with the third part of a ſhekel, for the ſervice of the houſe of our God, for the ſhew-bread, and for the continuall meat-offering, and for the continuall burnt-offerings of the Sabbaths, and of the new moons,</hi> &amp;c. but now it ſeems to eaſe the people in their poverty, Hezekiah appointed a portion for and toward theſe ſervices out of his own ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>He commanded the people that dwelt in Jeruſalem, to give the portion of the prieſts, and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord.]</hi> That is, that they might not be diſtracted with worldly cares of providing for themſelves, nor follow their callings heavily for want of maintenance, but might chearfully bend themſelves wholly to the ſervice of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>The children of Iſrael brought in abundance the firſt fruits of corn, wine, and oyle,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, thoſe in and about Jeruſalem, where the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was firſt given: for of the Iſraelites inhabiting the other cities of Judah the following verſe ſpeaks: or elſe in this verſe there is mention of the tithes and firſt-fruits of ſuch as grew out of the earth, and in the following verſe of the tithes of cattell and ſuch other things. And concerning the children of Iſrael and Judah that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they alſo brought in the tythes of oxen and ſheep, and
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:42229:373"/>
the tithe of holy things, that is, all other tithes that were by the Law of God due; which are here called <hi>the tithe of holy things,</hi> becauſe the tithes were to be ſet apart from the reſt of their goods, as things conſecrated and holy to the Lord: yet happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe words are ſpecially intended of thoſe ſecond tithes, which were not given for the maintenance of the Levites, but ſeparated for other holy uſes, for which ſee Deut. 14.22. and Levit. 27.30.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>In the third moneth they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finiſhed them in the ſeventh moneth.]</hi> For in the third moneth was their harveſt, and therefore the feaſt of Pentecoſt, which was in that moneth, was called <hi>the feaſt of harveſt,</hi> and in the ſeventh moneth they gathered all other fruits of the land, and therefore the feaſt of Tabernacles which was in that moneth, was called <hi>the feaſt of in gathering in the end of the yeare,</hi> Exod. 23.16.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then Hezekiah questioned with the prieſts and the Levites concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heaps.]</hi> That is, he demanded how it came to paſſe that they had ſpent no more of that proviſion that was brought in for them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Azariah the chief prieſt of the houſe of Zadok, anſwered him,</hi> &amp;c.] There were ſtill two chief prieſts of the two ſeverall families of Eleazar and Ithamar, that had the chief command in the Temple under the high prieſt, of which it ſeems this Azariah was one, who is therefore alſo called, verſ. 13. <hi>the ruler of the houſe of God.</hi>

                     <hi>For the Lord hath bleſſed his people; and that which is left is this great ſtore.]</hi> That is, ſince they brought in their firſt fruits and tithes, God hath ſo abundantly bleſſed the people, that their offerings have yielded us ſufficient proviſion, and this overplus which is left beſides.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And brought in the offerings and the tithes, and the dedicate things faithfully, over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to ſee the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and the tithes, and the dedicate things ſafely ſtored up, and carefully preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſeverall garners or chambers appointed for them, and to keep an account, both of what was brought in, and what was delivered forth, according to the order eſtabliſhed, 1.

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Beſide their genealogie of males, from three years old and upward,</hi> &amp;c.] Here is expreſſed more particularly who they were to whom theſe holy things were diſtributed; to wit, (beſides the males of three years old and upward, but under the age of twenty years, who had alſo their portion allotted to them, verſ. 18.) they give both to the prieſts and Levites, from twenty years old and upwards, as they came in their courſes to do their ſervice in the houſe of the Lord; yea, and beſides, verſ. 18. they gave to all that were regiſtred in the genealogies of the prieſts and Levites, even to their little ones, their wives, and their ſonnes, and their daughters through all the congregation.</p>

Indeed the Levites might not enter the holy place; but they might bring it to the entrance of the Temple, and there the prieſts might receive it of them: and perhaps by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites here are meant all the tribe of Levi, both prieſts and Levites.</p>

Kings 24.12, 13, 14. But yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe ſeventy years are rather to be numbred from the deſtruction of Jeruſalem; firſt, becauſe Dan. 9.2. they are called <hi>the ſeventy years of the deſolations of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> ſecondly becauſe the ſame term of ſeventy years is ſet for the ſubjection of other neighbouring nations, Iſaiah 23.15. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day that Tyre ſhall be forgotten ſeventy years,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo alſo Jer. 25.11. and it is well known that Nebuchadnezzar did not ſubdue thoſe neighbouring nations and make himſelf the great monarch of thoſe parts of the world, till the time that Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem was taken and deſtroyed: and thirdly, becauſe here and elſewhere uſually the prophecy of the ſeventy years, is ſaid to be fulfilled in the deſtruction of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and the following deſolation of that countrey.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow in the firſt yeare of Cyrus king of Perſia,</hi> &amp;c.] That this book of Ezra was alwayes acknowledged by the Jews a part of the ſacred Canon of Scripture, I find not queſtioned by any: indeed who was the penman and writer of it we cannot abſolutely ſay, yet generally it is held that it was written by Ezra whoſe name is ſet as the title of the book, and it is the more probable, becauſe he was of the chief ſtock of the prieſts, <hi>the ſonne,</hi> that is, the grandchild <hi>of Seraiah,</hi> chap. 7.1. who was <hi>the chief priest</hi> in the dayes of Zedekiah, and ſlain by the Chaldeans when Jeruſalem was deſtroyed by them, 2. Kings 25.18.21. and withall, becauſe he lived when theſe things were done which are related in this book, to wit, in the time of the peoples return from Babylon, and was a <hi>ready ſcribe,</hi> as is expreſſely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, chap. 7.6. and ſo the more likely to continue the hiſtory of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the Jews in his times, as the prophets that lived in the former ages had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally done in their times. The firſt two verſes are word for word the ſame that we have in the cloſe of the foregoing book of the ſecond of Chronicles (which hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome Expoſitours to think that the books of the Chronicles were alſo written by Ezra) and therein we are told, that <hi>in the firſt yeare of Cyrus king of Perſia,</hi> that is, in the firſt yeare of his Empire, the firſt yeare of his reigne over Babylon (for he had then been king of Perſia above twenty years) he gave the Jews libertie to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into their own countrey: we muſt know that Nebuchadnezzar after the taking of Jeruſalem had ſubdued all the nations round about, as was propheſied of him; yea even Egypt amongſt the reſt, the greateſt and ſtrongeſt of all thoſe bordering nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Jer. 25.9, 10, 11. <hi>Behold, I will ſend and take all the families of the north, ſaith the Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon my ſervant; and will bring them against this land, and againſt the inhabitants thereof, and againſt all theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And this whole land ſhall be a deſolation, and an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and theſe nations ſhall ſerve the king of Babylon ſeventy years,</hi> Iſa. 20.4. <hi>So ſhall the king of Aſſyria lead away the Egyptians priſoners, and the Ethiopians cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, young and old, naked and barefoot:</hi> ſee alſo Jer. 43.10, 11. and 44.30. and thus was the Babylonian Empire raiſed by Nebuchadnezzar, which he left to Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merodach his ſonne, and he to Belſhazzar his ſonne, according to that, Jer. 27.7. <hi>All nations ſhall ſerve him, and his ſonne, and his ſonnes ſonne:</hi> But then in Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzars time this great Empire was ruined by the Medes and Perſians, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged Babylon, took it, and deſtroyed it utterly, and ſlew Belſhazzar, and ſo fulfilled what was propheſied, Iſa. 47.1. <hi>Come down, and ſit in the duſt, O virgin daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Babylon, ſit on the ground, there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo Jer. 50.1, 2, 3. and thus the Empire was tranſlated from the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the Perſians: indeed in this warre againſt Babylon, the Medes had the chief
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:42229:377"/>
ſtroke for Darius Medus (or Cyaxares) did command in chief in this warre, and the army conſiſted moſt of his people, Iſa. 13.17. <hi>Behold, I will ſtirre up the Medes againſt them, which ſhall not regard ſilver,</hi> &amp;c. and Jer. 51.11. <hi>The Lord hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up the ſpirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is againſt Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore when Balthazar or Belſhazzar was ſlain he was made king, Dan. 5.30, 31. <hi>In that night was Belſhazzar the king of the Chaldeans ſlain, and Darius the Median took the kingdome, being about threeſcore and two years old:</hi> but yet withall, firſt, becauſe Cyrus (who was then abſolute king of Perſia, or Viceroy thereof under Darius the Mede) did joyn with Darius in this expedition againſt Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and by his valour and policie chiefly the citie was taken, as being the man preordained and forenamed by God himſelf for this great action: ſecondly, becauſe Darius it ſeems ſtayed not in Babylon, but returned into Media, and left Cyrus as his Viceroy in his room: and thirdly, becauſe (Darius who was Cyrus his great uncle, and as ſome think his father in law alſo) lived not full two years after, but left all to Cyrus his heir: therefore even from the firſt Cyrus was eſteemed the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of thoſe parts, and however in truth till the death of his uncle Darius the Mede, he was abſolute Monarch, but held alſo under him as his Viceroy, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Dan. 6.28. <hi>This Daniel proſpered in the reigne of Darius, and in the reigne of Cyrus the Perſian:</hi> yet the very firſt yeare after the conqueſt of Babylon was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoned as the firſt yeare of Cyrus reigne, as we ſee here, where it is ſaid that <hi>in the firſt yeare of Cyrus king of Perſia</hi> God ſtirred up his ſpirit to let the Jews go home to their own countrey, &amp;c. <hi>that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled,</hi> to wit, the promiſe concerning the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivitie at the end of ſeventy years, through the favour of Cyrus, Jer. 29.10. <hi>After ſeventy years be accompliſhed at Babylon, I will viſit you, and perform my good word towards you, in cauſing you to return this place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Thus ſaith Cyrus king of Perſia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdomes of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems that by Daniel or ſome other of the Jews, that it was diſcovered to Cyrus that many years before the Lord had told them by his prophets, that one Cyrus ſhould vanquiſh Babylon with other nations, and then ſhould freely deliver the Jews out of their captivitie, and cauſe their citie and Temple to be again built, all which for his better ſatisfaction they might ſhew him in the writings of the Prophet Iſaiah, Iſa. 44.1. —13. And hence it was that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that God had charged him to build the Temple, and confeſſed that thoſe kingdomes which he had ſubdued were given him of God; uſing theſe high terms, <hi>The Lord God hath given me all the kingdomes of the earth,</hi> either out of an affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the univerſall Monarchy of the whole world; or out of an hyperbolicall oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the largeneſſe of his Empire, to which all the kingdomes in thoſe parts of the world were ſubdued: according to thoſe expreſſions we meet with elſewhere, Luke 2.1. <hi>There went out a decree from Ceſar Auguſtus that all the world ſhould be taxed;</hi> and Acts 2.5. <hi>And there was dwelling at Jeruſalem Jews devout men out of every nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And whoſoever remaineth in any place where he ſojourneth, let the men of his place help him with ſilver,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, whoſoever abideth as a ſtranger or ſojourner in any place of my dominion and hath a mind to go up to Jeruſalem,
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:42229:377"/>
let the men that dwell in that place furniſh him with all proviſions requiſite for his journey, beſide that which they ſhall ſend by them as a free-will-offering for the building or ſervice of the Temple: the tranſporting of ſilver, and gold, and other commodities is in many places ſeverely forbidden, and ſo happely it was there; the king therefore gives licence to the Jews by his proclamation, for the carrying away of theſe things, and withall encourageth the people to afford them what help they could, by letting them know that his deſire was they ſhould be plentifully furniſhed with all things neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Then roſe up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, with all them whoſe ſpirit God had raiſed to go up,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, both of theſe and the other tribes alſo: ſome even of Judah and Benjamin went not, as being well ſettled where they were, and loth to remove; or deſirous to ſee firſt how theſe will ſpeed; but thoſe whoſe ſpirits God had ſtirred up went, not of theſe tribes onely, but of others alſo, 1. Chron. 9.3. <hi>And in Jeruſalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manaſſeh;</hi> and therefore ſome conceive that at this time that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Ezekiel was fulfilled, Ezek. 37.16, 17.21, 22. <hi>Sonne of man, take thee one ſtick and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Iſrael his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joſeph the ſtick of Ephraim, and for all the houſe of Iſrael his companions. And joyn them one to another into one ſtick, and they ſhall become one in thy hand: and ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I will take the children of Iſrael from among the heathen whither they be gone, and will gather them on every ſide, and bring them into their own land. And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Iſrael, and one king ſhall be king to them all: and they ſhall be no more two nations, neither ſhall they be divided into two kingdomes, any more at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Alſo Cyrus the king brought forth the veſſels of the houſe of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the moſt of them were cut and defaced, and onely laid up in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the houſe of their gods (of which Bel was the chief, Eſay 46.1. <hi>Bel boweth down, Nebo ſtoopeth,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 51.44. <hi>I will puniſh Bel in Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. and that as a monument of the taking of Jeruſalem, 2. Kings 24.13. <hi>And he carried out thence all the treaſures of the houſe of the Lord and the treaſure of the kings houſe,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe that place in the kings muſt be meant of the veſſels which Solomon made, which being old and worn with age were cut in pieces, there being others alſo made afterwards for the uſe of the Temple, which were carried away whole, and now reſtored: at this time alſo the king ſent letters with them to command his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in Syria to afford them all neceſſaries, chap. 6.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And numbred them unto Sheſhbazzar the prince of Judah.]</hi> That is, Zerubbabel; for he that laid the foundation of the Temple is called Zerubbabel, chap. 3.8. <hi>In the ſecond moneth began Zerubbabel the ſonne of Shealtiel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the work of the houſe of the Lord:</hi> and elſewhere Shebazzar, chap. 5.16. <hi>Then came Shebazzar and laid the foundation of the houſe of God:</hi> he was the chief prince of the tribe of Judah, and of the bloud royall, the ſonne of Salathiel, and grandchild of Jechoniah, Matth. 1.12. and ſo was by Cyrus made ruler of thoſe that now went up to Jeruſalem, chap. 5.14. <hi>Thoſe did Cyrus the king take out of the
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:42229:378"/>
Temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whoſe name was Sheſhbazzar, whom he made governour:</hi> and thus the government was ſtill in the tribe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah according to that prophecy of Jacob, Gen. 49.10. <hi>The ſceptre ſhall not depart from Judah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Nine and twenty knives.]</hi> Theſe knives were ſuch doubtleſſe as were uſed by the prieſts in killing the ſacrifices, and being it ſeems trimmed richly with gold and ſilver, are therefore reckoned here amongſt the plate that was carried out of the Temple by Nebuchadnezzar, and now reſtored by Cyrus.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Silver baſons of a ſecond ſort, foure hundred and ten.]</hi> That is, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſize, or of another kind and faſhion, happely thoſe of the firſt ſort were for the ſervice of the Temple, theſe of the ſecond ſort for the courts and chambers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And other veſſels a thouſand.]</hi> That is, other veſſels of the chief ſort: for this is not the number of all the other veſſels, great and ſmall, not before mentioned, as is evident in the following verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>All the veſſels of gold and of ſilver, were five thouſand and foure hundred.]</hi> That is both of thoſe before mentioned, and thoſe that are here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſſed.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>NOw theſe are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity,</hi> &amp;c.] In this chapter we have a catalogue of thoſe that went out of Babylon with Zerubbabel, when Cyrus by his proclamation gave them liberty to return. Some conceive they are called <hi>the children of the province,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had dwelt in Babylon. But I rather conceive that it is the land of Judea which is here called <hi>the province,</hi> and ſo with reſpect thereto, the Jews are here called <hi>the children of the province,</hi> becauſe Judea was now one of the provinces that were in ſubjection to the Babylonian Empire, according to that Eſther 1.1. <hi>Ahaſuerus which reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and ſeven and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty provinces.</hi> Now though it be moſt probable that ſome of the ten tribes that were carried into Aſſyria before Nebuchadnezzars reigne, did now return with Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, chap. 1.5. yet becauſe there were but few of them to ſpeak of, therefore they that returned, are ſaid to be thoſe <hi>whom Nebuchadnezzar had carryed away,</hi> and they are ſaid to have returned <hi>every one unto his citie,</hi> whereby is meant not the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein they had formerly dwelt, but the cities appointed them by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent governours for their dwelling; for thoſe of the ten tribes that did now return, dwelt not in the cities of Samaria, but in the cities of Judah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Jeſhua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe that are here expreſſed by name, were doubtleſſe the chiefeſt and moſt eminent of thoſe that went now with Zerubbabel, the moſt of them happely captains and governours of the people, and then afterwards he addes in the ſequel of the chapter, <hi>the number of the men of the people of Iſrael,</hi> that is, how many there were of the people. Now concerning thoſe that are expreſſed by name, we muſt note; firſt, that Jeſhua was the high prieſt the ſonne of Jozadak, chap. 3.2. called elſewhere <hi>Joſhua the ſonne of Joſedech,</hi> as Haggai 1.1. the great aſſiſtant of Zerubbabel, in the building of the Temple: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that in Nehem. 7.7. where the catalogue of thoſe that did at firſt go up
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:42229:378"/>
with Zerubbabel is again ſet down, ſome of theſe here mentioned are called by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names, as Seraiah is there called Azariah; Relaijah, Raamiah; Miſper, Miſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; and Rehum, Nahum; and withall there is one added there, to wit, Nahuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, that is not mentioned here: and thirdly, that it is not probable that either Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah here mentioned, was that famous Nehemiah the pen-man of that book of Scripture which is called by his name; or Mordecai, that famous Mordecai that was Eſthers uncle, but two others of the ſame name: for firſt, had that Nehemiah gone up in the firſt yeare of Cyrus, he muſt needs have been well ſtricken in years, and yet we ſee he was cup-bearer to Artaxerxes, Neh. 2.1. and the Perſians uſed to have young men to attend them in ſuch places: and ſecondly, from the firſt yeare of Cyrus to Darius the laſt who was beaten by Alexander the great, there was at leaſt two hundred years and upwards, and till the time of that Darius the laſt, did that famous Nehemiah live; for in his book mention is made of Jaddua the prieſt, Neh. 12.11. of whom we reade in Joſephus that he met Alexander the great in his prieſtly robes, and ſo ſtayed him from doing any hurt to the city and Temple: and as for Mordecai Eſthers uncle, he brought up Eſther in Shuſhan in Perſia long after this in the dayes of Ahaſuerus (or Zerxes) and therefore did not return with Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel in the firſt yeare of Cyrus, as this Mordecai did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>The children of Paroſh,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the poſterity of Paroſh, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the family whereof Paroſh was the head or chief: afterwards verſ. 21. many of the people are mentioned by the names of the cities where they had formerly dwelt, as <hi>the children of Beth-lehem, the children of Netophah,</hi> &amp;c. but that the proper names here mentioned are not the names of cities, but the names of men that were the heads of families is evident, Neh. 10.14. where many of them are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as <hi>the chief of the people</hi> that ſealed the covenant.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>The children of Arah, ſeven hundred ſeventy and five.]</hi> Neh. 7.10. it is ſix hundred fifty two, which muſt thus be reconciled, that ſeven hundred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty five (as here is ſaid) gave up their names in Babylon that they would return, but onely ſix hundred fifty two mentioned in Nehemiah, came up into Judea; the reſt changing their minds, or dying by the way: and the like muſt be held concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning verſ. 8, 27, 28, 33, 42, 60.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Of the children of Jeſhua and Joab, two thouſand eight hundred and twelve.]</hi> Neh. 7.11. the number is, two thouſand eight hundred and eighteen; to wit, becauſe when they came up into Judea, there were ſix more then had given up their names in Babylon, the like muſt be held concerning verſ. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 35, 41, 65.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety and eight.]</hi> That is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there were ſeverall families deſcended of Ater of the children of Hezekiah, who was the head of one of thoſe families, there were ninety and eight.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>The children of Beth-lehem,</hi> &amp;c.] That is the children of thoſe that were formerly inhabitants of Beth-lehem: and ſo we muſt underſtand the following verſes, wherein there are any townes or cities mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>The children of Kirjath-arim, Chephirah,</hi> &amp;c.] Or Kiriath-jearim and Ceprah, Neh. 7.29.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>The children of Nebo, fifty and two.]</hi> Not Nebo in the tribe of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:42229:379"/>
but Nebo in the tribe of Judah, called uſually Nob, and therefore Nehemiah calleth it <hi>the other Nebo.</hi> Neh. 7.33.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>The children of Magbiſh, an hundred fifty and ſix.]</hi> Theſe are not mentioned at all in Nehemiah, ſee above verſ. 5.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>The Nethinims.]</hi> See 1. Chron. 9.2.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 55. <hi>The children of Solomons ſervants.]</hi> That is, the ſtrangers, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes that were imployed by Solomon in the building of the Temple, and having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved long amongſt the children of Judah, were now reckoned amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 61. <hi>Which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.]</hi> Some conceive that Barzillai was a prieſt, and theſe prieſts that married the daughters and heirs of the family, were therefore called by that name, but becauſe they could not prove their genealogie were put from the prieſthood: Others conceive, that theſe prieſts marrying into the noble family of Barzillai, diſregarding the honour of the prieſthood, becauſe in the captivity where they were not imployed as prieſts in offering up ſacrifices, they had neither any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nor honour by being prieſts, did therefore chuſe to be called after the family of their wives; but now being returned to Judea, and the prieſthood growing into fame and requeſt again, theſe degenerate prieſts would fain have taken place among the prieſts of the Lord; but not being now able to prove their genealogie they were amongſt others put from the prieſthood.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 63. <hi>And the Tirſhatha ſaid unto them, that they ſhould not eat,</hi> &amp;c.] Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhatha is a name of office, as the commiſſary the governour or deputy of the king. It is elſewhere given to Nehemiah, Neh. 8.9. <hi>And Nehemiah which is the Tirſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha:</hi> and therefore ſome think that this catalogue was taken by Nehemiah though it be ſet down here: but becauſe Nehemiah came out of Babylon ſo long after the Jewes came firſt thence, therefore it is rather here meant of Zerubbabel who was now chief governour, called alſo Sheſhbazzar, chap. 1.8. and whereas it is here ſaid, that theſe prieſts that could not prove their genealogie, <hi>ſhould not eat of the moſt holy things, till there ſtood up a prieſt</hi> with Urim and with Thummim, hereby it is manifeſt, that the Urim and Thummim was either loſt or burnt together with many other things when the Chaldees took Jeruſalem, and indeed however Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel hoped as it ſeemes by theſe words, that they might by the providence of God he had again; yet they were never found again, the Lord thereby teaching the Church that the ceremonies were going and the Meſſias coming, that ſalvation was not to be placed in the ordinances of Moſes, but that they were ſhortly to expect the true Urim and Thummim Chriſt Jeſus, the high prieſt of their profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 64. <hi>The whole congregation together, was fourty and two thouſand three hundred and threeſcore.]</hi> That is, both of thoſe of Judah and Benjamin, of whom the particular numbers are before punctually expreſſed, and thoſe of the other ten tribes who are not here mentioned. If we ſumme up the particular numbers before ſet down, they all amount but to twenty nine thouſand eight hundred and eighteen, which is above twelve thouſand leſſe then the totall ſumme here expreſſed, and theſe no doubt were thoſe of the other ten tribes that returned with their brethren of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Benjamin, 1. Chron. 9.3. <hi>And in Jeruſalem dwelt of the children of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:42229:379"/>
and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manaſſeh:</hi> we no where reade of ſo many that were carryed into Babylon, but it ſeems they multiplyed greatly in Babylon as formerly in Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 65. <hi>And there were among them two hundred ſinging-men, and ſinging-women.]</hi> Theſe were ſuch as were imployed amongſt them in ſinging at their wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and funerals, and ſuch other ſolemnities, 2. Chron. 35.25. in Nehemiah 7.67. it is ſaid there were of theſe two hundred forty five, but for this, ſee the note above, verſ. 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 68. <hi>When they came to the houſe of the Lord which is at Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, to the place where the Temple had ſtood.</p>

Kings 8.2. &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people having ſpent ſome time in ſettling their own domeſticall affairs in the ſeverall towns and cities where they were to dwell, at leaſt the ſeventh moneth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching they did unanimouſly aſſemble together unto Jeruſalem, that they might build the altar, and prepare for the keeping of theſe ſolemnities.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And they ſet the altar upon his baſes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they built the altar upon the foundations of Solomons altar which were ſtill ſtanding, and the reaſon of this is added in the following words <hi>(for fear was upon them becauſe of the people of thoſe countries)</hi> that is, they laid not a new foundation for haſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they feared, that if it were not ſoon diſpatched, they ſhould be hindred by the Samaritanes the neighbouring inhabitants of that countrey, who already it ſeems began to threaten them, and to bandy againſt them. Yet ſome conceive that in theſe words a reaſon is given, not why they built the altar upon the old baſes or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Solomons altar, but why they would not ſtay the building of the altar till the temple was built: it was, becauſe they were afraid of the Samaritanes; and ſo they haſtened the building of the altar, that by offering up ſacrifices to God, they might ſeek his favour and aſſiſtance againſt thoſe their envious and malignant neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>They kept alſo the feast of tabernacles,</hi> &amp;c.] With what extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſolemnity this feaſt was afterward kept, we ſee, Neh. 8.13.18.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>From the firſt day of the ſeventh moneth began they to offer burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> &amp;c.] Which was the day appointed by the law for the feaſt of trumpets,

                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then stood Joſhua, with his ſonnes and his brethren,</hi> &amp;c.] Not the ſonne of Joſedech the high prieſt, but a Levite of the ſame name, of whom mention is made before, chap. 2.40.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Lord; becauſe he is good, for his mercie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever towards Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, ſinging the 118. or the 136. Pſalme. See 2. Chron. 5.13. and 7.3.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Ancient men that had ſeen the first houſe, when the foundation of this houſe was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, both becauſe many of the holy things that were in the former houſe were like to be wanting in this, and eſpecially becauſe the glory of this building was not likely to equall the glory of the firſt which Solomon built; a ſhadow intimating the wearing away of the legall ceremonies. Yea thus it continued to be with the people, when afterwards the building of the Temple went forward in the dayes of Darius, whence it was that Haggai the Prophet, who propheſied in the ſecond yeare of Darius the king, Hag. 1.1. did encourage and comfort the people with that promiſe, Hag. 2.9. <hi>The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater then of the former;</hi> which yet he meant not of the glory of the building; but of the glorious appearance of Chriſt the promiſed Meſſiah herein: nor needs it ſeem ſtrange that ſome were now living that had ſeen the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Temple; for that was deſtroyed in the eleventh yeare of the captivitie, 2. Kings 25. and therefore it was but threeſcore years after that when the foundations of this new houſe were laid.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>THen they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and ſaid unto them, Let us build with you,</hi> &amp;c.] This they did doubtleſſe not out of any ſincere deſire to ſet forward the building, or to advance the worſhip of God (for theſe Samaritanes that ſpake this were alwayes deadly enemies to the Jews) but either to curry favour with Cyrus (for becauſe he now favoured the Jews and gave way to the building of the Temple, therefore they would be as one people with them, and approve it by joyning with them in this holy work) or elſe out of hope that their people being mingled with the Jews in this work, there would ſome contention ariſe, and ſo the work would be hindred; yet to the end they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the Jews, they alledged they ſerved and ſacrificed to the true God of Iſrael (as indeed they pretended to do, though withall they ſerved their idol-gods too, 2. Kings 17.33. <hi>They feared the Lord, and ſerved their own Gods) even ſince the dayes of Eſarhaddon king of Aſſur,</hi> who was the ſonne of Shalmaneſer, and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child of Sennacherib, 2. Kings 19.37. and it ſeems brought a new colony of ſeverall nations into the land of Samaria, as his father had done before him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>You have nothing to do with us, to build an houſe unto our God,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus Zerubbabel and the reſt anſwered the Samaritanes, becauſe they were idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and neither were of the ſtock of Iſrael, nor did purely worſhip the God of Iſrael: therefore they proteſted againſt them, that they had nothing to do with the Temple to ſacrifice there, and ſo alſo not to joyn with them in the building of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:42229:380"/>
withall that they would build it themſelves, as ſay they, <hi>king Cyrus the king of Perſia hath commanded us,</hi> wherein they give them to underſtand that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they had from the king, did warrant them to do what they did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Then the people of the land weakned the hands of the people of Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when Samaritanes could not by fraud accompliſh their deſires, becauſe the Jews would not admit them to joyn with them in building the Temple, then they uſed other means to hinder them in their work; to wit, partly by threatning them, and by raiſing any falſe rumours that might diſcourage them, and partly, no doubt, by uſing all means that they might not have thoſe materials and money out of the kings revenues which Cyrus had commanded ſhould be given them for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple, chap. 6.3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And hired counſellours againſt them, to fruſtrate their purpoſe,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Samaritanes did not onely do what themſelves could to hinder the Jews in building the Temple, but by bribes alſo they ſecretly hired ſuch as were powerfull with the king of Perſia; to wit, the deputies and governours in Samaria and other provinces, yea, and thoſe that were of his privie counſel in Perſia, to adviſe the king by many falſe pretences and informations, to diſanull that decree which had been made for the building of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this they did all the dayes of Cyrus king of Perſia, even untill the reigne of Darius king of Perſia; that is, all the dayes of Cyrus and Cambyſes his ſonne, and Smerdis the Magus (who a while uſurped the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome after Cambyſes death) unto the ſecond yeare of Darius the ſonne of Hyſtaſpes, when the work of the Temple was again ſet forward, verſ. 24. <hi>So it ceaſed unto the ſecond yeare of the reigne of Darius king of Perſia;</hi> and that by the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prophet Haggai, Hag. 1.1. <hi>In the ſecond yeare of Darius the king, in the ſixth moneth, in the firſt day of the moneth, came the word of the Lord by Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai the prophet unto Zerubbabel,</hi> &amp;c, It may ſeem ſtrange indeed that the building of the Temple ſhould be hindred in Cyrus time; but for this we muſt know that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus going abroad a while after the return of the Jews, to finiſh ſuch other warlike expeditions as he had in hand, he left Cambyſes his ſonne, or Viceroy, to govern the kingdome in his abſence, who is therefore called <hi>the Prince of the kingdome of Perſia,</hi> Dan. 10.13. and with him thoſe counſellours mentioned did ſo farre prevail, that he countermanded the building begun. Cyrus being dead, Cambyſes reigned in his ſtead, a wicked and cruell Prince (that as other hiſtories report, ſlew his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and married his own ſiſter, and afterwards put her to death) and no marvell though he were an enemy to the Jews, when he reigned as abſolute king in his own right, having been ſo when he governed the kingdome as Viceroy in his fathers right: eſpecially if we conſider what other hiſtories report, that he was reſolved to invade Egypt, and therefore he might well fear the Jews, who were accuſed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a rebellious people, and ready ſtill to ſide with Egypt: whileſt he was abroad following the warres, one Smerdis one of his Magi (pretending himſelf to be Smer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis the brother of Cambyſes) uſurped the kingdome, whereof Cambyſes hearing, as he was mounting his horſe to haſte home, his ſword unſheathing ran into his thigh, and ſo he died without iſſue: God revenging the great wrong he had done to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He being dead, the ſeven Princes of Perſia ſoon ſlew the uſurping Magus, and and then Darius Hyſtaſpes was choſen Emperour, in whoſe ſecond yeare a decree was
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:42229:381"/>
made for the Jewes rebuilding of the Temple, chap. 6.1. Many learned men indeed are of opinion that it was Darius Nothus, that was long after Darius Hyſtaſpes, that made this decree, and that Darius the ſonne of Hyſtaſpes is here mentioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, as one of thoſe kings in whoſe time the building of the Temple was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: but from the firſt yeare of Cyrus to the ſecond of Darius Nothus is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily accounted above one hundred and thirty years: and firſt, Zerubbabel being of ſome good years when he came out of Babylon, it is not probable that he ſhould live ſo long, and yet we know that he laid the foundations of the Temple in Cyrus his dayes, and he alſo finiſhed it in the ſixth yeare of Darius, according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, Zach. 4.9. <hi>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this houſe, his hands ſhall alſo finiſh it; and thou ſhalt know that the Lord of hoſts hath ſent me unto you:</hi> and ſecondly, ſome of thoſe that had ſeen the Temple before it was deſtroyed by the Chaldeans, were it ſeems alive when that decree of Darius was made, Haggai 2.3. <hi>Who is left among you that ſaw this houſe in her firſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? and how do you ſee it now? is it not in your eyes in compariſon of it, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi> which could not be if it were Darius Nothus; either therefore it was Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius the ſonne of Hyſtaſpes that renewed Cyrus his decree, or elſe of neceſſity we muſt hold that the king of Perſia reigned not in their ſeverall times, ſo long as it is by all Hiſtorians reported they did, which if we might admit, then happely it might be ſaid that it was Darius Nothus (of whom mention is made, verſ. 24. of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, and chap. 6. verſ. 1. who made a new decree to ſecond that of Cyrus for the rebuilding of the Temple, and that theſe words are meant of the reigne of Darius the ſonne of Hyſtaſpes incluſively, he being numbred amongſt thoſe kings in whoſe times the enemies of the Jewes did by underhand dealing trouble them, and ſeek to fruſtrate their purpoſe in building the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And in the reigne of Ahaſuerus, in the beginning of his reigne, wrote they unto him an accuſation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jeruſalem.]</hi> They that hold that Darius the ſonne of Hyſtaſpes is mentioned in the former verſe inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, to wit, that to the end of his reigne, the enemies of the Jewes did ſecretly hire counſellours againſt them to hinder them in their work, they alſo hold that Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus here mentioned, was Xerxes that fourth rich king of Perſia, mentioned Dan. 11.2. <hi>And the fourth ſhall be farre richer then they all, and by his ſtrength through his riches he ſhall ſtirre up all against the realme of Grecia;</hi> and that he was called Ahaſuerus, that is <hi>an hereditary prince,</hi> becauſe he was the firſt ſonne of Darius Hyſtaſpes by his wife Atoſſa, who was the daughter of Cyrus, and that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reigne the Jewes enemies began firſt openly to write letters of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt them for building the Temple: and ſo again likewiſe they hold that Artaxerxes mentioned in the following verſe, was Artaxerxes Longimanus the ſonne of Xerxes by Eſther <hi>the daughter of Abihail,</hi> Eſther 2.15. who is by other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors called Ameſtris the daughter of Otan, and ſo that the building of the Temple ceaſed in the reigne of both theſe kings, untill the ſecond yeare of Darius Nothus who was the baſtard ſonne of this Artaxerxes, and ſucceeded him in the throne, but for the reaſons mentioned in the former note, and withall, becauſe it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Temple lay ſo long unbuilt, and eſpecially in the dayes of Ahaſuerus or Xerxes the husband of Eſther, therefore the more probable opinion of all other
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:42229:381"/>
Interpreters generally is, that it is Cambyſes the ſonne of Cyrus who is here called both Ahaſuerus, verſ. 6. and Artaxerxes, verſ. 7. ſo that what was generally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, verſ. 5. is now more particularly expreſſed in the ſequel of the chapter.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And in the dayes of Artaxerxes wrote Biſhlam, Mithridath,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Interpreters tranſlate this word Biſhlam <hi>in peace,</hi> and ſo they would have the meaning of the words to be, that Mithridath and the other here mentioned wrote to Artaxerxes againſt the Jewes, ſecretly and cunningly; when in the mean ſeaſon they carried themſelves towards the Jewes, as if they had been at peace with them and meant them no hurt: but better I conceive is this word by our Tranſlatours ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as the name of one of the chief of thoſe that wrote to Artaxerxes. And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Artaxerxes, it is ſaid before in the foregoing note, that though ſome hold it was Artaxerxes Longimanus the ſonne of Xerxes, who is called Ahaſuerus in the former verſe; yet moſt generally it is held that the ſame Cambyſes the ſonne of Cyrus, who is called Ahaſuerus in the former verſe, is here called Artaxerxes, verſ. 6. it is ſaid that they wrote to Ahaſuerus againſt the Jewes, where Cambyſes is called by the name given him amongſt the Chaldees, and now in this verſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to ſet down the copy of the letters, the penman of this ſtory doth again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the time when, and the king to whom it was written, onely here he calls him by his Perſian name which it ſeems was uſed in the letter, to wit, Artaxerxes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in the Syrian tongue.]</hi> That is, in the Syrian tongue, and with Syrian characters.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Rehum the Chancellour, and Shimſhai the Scribe, wrote a letter againſt Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the letter was compoſed by Rehum the Chancellour and written by Shimſhai the ſcribe, though it was written in the name of thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned verſ. 7. and others the Governours in Samaria, and from this to verſ. 19. chap 6. the ſtory is written in the Chaldee tongue.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>The Dinaites, the Apharſathchites,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe were ſeverall people that were placed by the Aſſyrians in Samaria, who joyned now in writing theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Artaxerxes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the reſt of the nations whom the great and noble Aſnappar brought over,</hi> &amp;c.] The moſt of Expoſitours think that it is Eſarhaddon mentioned before, verſ. 2. the ſonne of Sennacherib who brought over a colony of theſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into Samaria, that is here called <hi>the great and noble Aſnappar,</hi> yet it may be meant of ſome great commander or chief officer of Eſarhaddon, imployed by him in bringing over this colony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the rest that are on this ſide the river.]</hi> That is, Euphrates that divided the Jews from the Babylonians.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And have ſet up the walls thereof, and joyned the foundations.]</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no mention any where made that they had at this time meddled with building of the walls: but on the contrary we reade, that long after this complaint was made to Nehemiah, Nehem. 1.3. that the wall of Jeruſalem was broken down and the gates thereof burnt with fire, that is, that they continued in that condition as Nebuchadnezzar had long ago left them; therefore it is moſt likely that this was a mere falſhood which the Samaritanes charged upon the Jews, onely thereby to
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:42229:382"/>
ſtirre up jealouſies in the king of Perſia againſt them; and indeed it is not probable that they would undertake the building of the city walls, when they were not well able to go through with that work which they had firſt ſet upon, and were ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly intended to finiſh it, to wit, the building of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>That ſearch may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers.]</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Artaxerxes was a Perſian, and the rebellion of the Jewes which is here objected, was not againſt the Perſians, but againſt the Aſſyrians and Babylonians, to what end ſhould ſearch be made in the records of Artaxerxes his father? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Firſt, that the Perſians did uſually aid the Aſſyrians and Babylonians againſt the Jews, and becauſe of this there might be mention made of the rebellion of the Jews againſt the Syrians in the records of the Perſian kings, ſee Iſaiah 22.6.

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zachariah the ſonne of Iddo propheſied unto the Jews,</hi> &amp;c.] The building of the Temple having a long time ceaſed, Darius at length being choſen king of Perſia, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Haggai was ſent from God to the Jews, <hi>in the ſecond yeare of Darius in the ſixth moneth,</hi> Haggai 1.1. and then two moneths after him Zachariah the ſonne of Iddo, that is, the grandchild of Iddo; for he was the ſonne of Barachiah the ſonne of Iddo, Zach. 1.1. <hi>In the eighth moneth, in the ſecond yeare of Darius came the word of the Lord unto Zachariah the ſonne of Barachiah, the ſonne of Iddo the prophet,</hi> &amp;c. and was afterwards ſlain by the Jews, Matth. 23.35. and ſo both theſe prophets did joyntly together reprove the Jews for neglecting this work, and did perſwade them to ſet upon it again, ſhewing them that the famine that had been of late amongſt them, was a puniſhment of God upon them for neglecting of this work. It is true indeed, they had been commanded by the king of Perſia to deſiſt from building the citie, chap. 4.12.21. but there was no one word in that letter to forbid the building of the Temple: and beſides there being now a new king in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and of another family, why did they not afreſh return to their work? theſe prophets therefore did ſharply reprove their ſloth, and incite them to ſet forward the work</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And with them were the prophets of God helping them.]</hi> To wit, by exhorting and ſtirring up the people to buckle themſelves cloſely and couragiouſly to the work, and happely alſo by doing what they could do to help the work for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for the peoples greater encouragement.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Then ſaid we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?]</hi> It is evident that theſe adverſaries of the Jewes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired concerning the names of thoſe that were principall agents in this buſineſſe, as we ſee verſ. 10. <hi>We asked their names alſo to certifie thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them;</hi> and therefore Expoſitours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this as ſpoken in their perſon, <hi>we ſaid,</hi> that is, we Tatnai, Shether-Boznai, and the reſt ſaid unto the Jewes, <hi>What are the names of the men?</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jewes, that they could not cauſe them to ceaſe, till the matter came to Darius.]</hi> That is, the Jews being a poore unſettled friendleſſe people, might well have been feared by the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe their powerfull adverſaries, but by the providence of God over them they were ſo encouraged, and their enemies ſo farre reſtrained, that nothing was done to hinder them, but they were content to let them go on till the matter was brought to Darius his knowledge, who afterward gave them liberty and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to go on in their work.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And ſince that time even untill now, hath it been in building,</hi> &amp;c.] Though oft interrupted, ſo that of late the work had ceaſed many years together, Chap. 4.24. to wit, the eight years of Cambyſes reigne, and the two firſt years of Darius Hyſtaſpes.</p>

Chron. 3.4. and now allowed to be but ſixty cubits high; or elſe, the cubits here meant were the common cubits, whereas in thoſe places in the Kings and Chronicles, the ſacred or geometricall cubits were meant. As for the directions here given for the breadth of it, <hi>the breadth thereof was threeſcore cubits,</hi> it is manifeſt that Solomons Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was but twenty cubits broad, 1. Kings 6.2. and as manifeſt it is that the very foundations of this Temple which Zerubbabel built, came farre ſhort of Solomons Temple, chap. 3.12. <hi>Many of the prieſts and Levites, and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men that had ſeen the firſt houſe, when the foundation of his houſe was laid before their eyes, wept;</hi> and therefore was not doubtleſſe fourty cubits broader then Solomons, as by this place it may ſeem: either therefore the cubits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Cyrus were not ſo large as thoſe ſacred gcometricall cubits, by which the meaſure of Solomons Temple was ſet forth (which is indeed the uſuall anſwer of moſt Expoſitours) or elſe by the breadth thereof here is meant the utmoſt extent of it, both north and ſouth, and alſo eaſt and weſt, (and ſo the length, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the breadth, is not here mentioned) and then indeed this houſe muſt needs be farre ſhort of that which Solomon built, whoſe length alone was ſixty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, though but twenty cubits broad, 1. Kings 6.2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>With three rows of great ſtones, and a row of new timber.]</hi> Some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours conceive that Cyrus in this direction given for the building of the Temple, had reſpect to the faſhion of building uſed amongſt the Perſians in their moſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſes or Temples, according to which he thought fit the Temple ſhould be made; but becauſe this direction agreeth ſo fully with the deſcription of the buildings about the inner court of Solomons Temple, 1. Kings 6.36. <hi>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed ſtone, and a row of cedar beams;</hi> I rather conceive, that it is here meant alſo concerning the new raiſing of thoſe buildings about the prieſts court, that they ſhould be made as formerly, <hi>with three rows of great ſtones, and a row of timber;</hi> that is, with three galleries of ſtone, and one of timber, or three gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of ſtone, each of them being covered or floored with timber.</p>

The chief cauſe why Darius afforded them this favour, was becauſe God had enclined his heart thereto; yet becauſe he had married Atoſſa the daughter of Cyrus, even in that regard he might be the more forward to further the work which Cyrus had begun.</p>

<pb n="750" facs="tcp:42229:384"/>
anſwers are given by Expoſitours: for firſt, ſome ſay that the Jews ſpake not of the building of the Temple in the time of the Perſian kings, but of the building of it by Herod, who did in a manner build it anew; and that was properly the Temple of which Chriſt then ſpake: and indeed though Joſephus ſaith that he was not full nine years in building it, yet conſidering that above thirty years after they were ſtill beautifying and enlarging the Temple, with ſome addition or other, I ſee not but that it may be very probably thought that the Jews ſpake indeed of the building of the Temple by Herod: and ſecondly, others ſay that Cyrus reigned after he came to the Empire thirty years, to which if we adde the eight yeare of Cambyſes his ſonne, and two years of the uſurpation of the Magi, as ſome account, then the ſixth yeare of Darius Hyſtaſpes, makes ſix and fourty years; and if it could be made good out of thoſe that have written the hiſtory of theſe times, that Cyrus reigned ſo long after he came to the Empire, this anſwer would fully ſatisfie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>As it is written in the book of Moſes.]</hi> Becauſe Ezra alledgeth here the book of Moſes, it may hence appear, that not Ezra (as ſome have ſaid) but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf did write thoſe five firſt books of the Scripture, commonly called the books of Moſes.</p>

Chron. 6.7—10. which are here omitted, to wit, Johanan, Azariah, Ahimaaz, Zadok, Ahitub, and Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah; which was done doubtleſſe onely for brevities ſake, the drift of this cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue being onely to ſhew that Ezra was of the ſtock of Aaron: but why theſe were left out rather than others, there cannot I think any ſure reaſon be given.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And there went up ſome of the children of Iſrael, and of the prieſts,</hi> &amp;c.] Of thoſe that hitherto had ſtayed in Babylon and Aſſyria, and went not up at firſt with Zerubbabel, there did ſome now go up with Ezra in the ſeventh yeare of Artaxerxes, which was about fifty eight years after the ſixth yeare of Darius men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned chap. 6.15.

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Then ſent I for Eliezer,</hi> &amp;c.] That which is here noted by way of diſtinction concerning theſe eleven men whom Ezra choſe to ſend unto Iddo for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, to wit, that the firſt nine were chief men, and the two laſt Jarib and Elna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than were <hi>men of underſtanding,</hi> may well I conceive be thus underſtood, that the firſt nine were of the chiefeſt rank and dignitie amongſt them, princes or heads of families, and the other two were men of ſpeciall note for their wiſedome, learning, and eloquence, and therefore picked out for the well mannaging that great buſineſſe that they had now in hand.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 47. <hi>And I ſent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief, at the place Caſiphia,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe he had ſpeciall uſe of the Levites, to wit, to help in that which was the chief buſineſſe of his journey, the inſtructing of the people in the law of God, and the reforming of thoſe things he ſhould find out of order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, according to the rule and direction of the law; when he found that there was none of the Levites amongſt thoſe that were going up with him, he diſpatched certain meſſengers to a place called Caſiphia, where he knew there were many Levites, and Iddo was the chief magiſtrate there, or elſe they were trained up in the knowledge of the law (as in a Colledge) under Iddo their chief doctour and preſident, to deſire him that he would ſend them certain Levites to go up with him to Jeruſalem, that they might aſſiſt him in that work which he had now undertaken. Where this Caſiphia was we cannot ſay, onely this we may ſay, that becauſe theſe meſſengers went thither and came back with the Levites and Nethinims, which Iddo ſent him within the compaſſe of ſo few dayes (for Ezra begun his journey upon the firſt day of the firſt moneth, chap, 7.9. <hi>upon the firſt day of the firſt moneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan he to go up from Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. and went away from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the firſt moneth, as is expreſſed verſ. 21. <hi>Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the firſt moneth,</hi> &amp;c.) it is not probable that by Caſiphia is meant as ſome conceive the Caſpian mountains, which were in the furtheſt part of Media, betwixt Armenia and Hyrcania.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Alſo of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the ſervice of the Levites,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe the Gibeonites were appointed for the ſervice of the Levites by Joſhua, long before Davids time, and were thence called Nethinims, that is, men given to God; therefore ſome Expoſitours conceive, that David did adde to the Nethinims, others that were not of the Gibeonites: but there is no neceſſity why we ſhould thus underſtand this place: for it may well be that the Gibeonites were thoſe Nethinims of whom it is ſaid here, that David and the princes had appointed them for the ſervice of the Levites; and that becauſe though Joſhua did firſt deſigne them to this ſervice, yet David did confirm them therein, and perhaps gave ſome ſpeciall orders for the manner of their attendance.</p>

                  <p>Verſ, 1. <hi>THe princes came to me, ſaying, The people of Iſrael, and the prieſts, and the Levites have not ſeparated themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] It being well known that the principall cauſe of Ezraes coming was to reform ſuch abuſes as were crept in amongſt them contrary to the law; ſome of the princes that were beſt affected came preſently to him, and informed him of this, as one of the moſt hainous evils tolerated amongſt them; to wit, that not the people onely but the princes alſo, yea, the prieſts and Levites that could not pretend ignorance of the law, had married wives of thoſe idolatrous nations their neighbours about them, and ſo alſo were tainted by that means in many things with their abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Some Expoſitours conceive, that this was done before their return out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon; and indeed though theſe nations here mentioned, the Canaanites, Moabites, Ammonites, &amp;c. dwelt farre from Babylon, yet we muſt conſider, that many of them were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar as the Jews were, Jerem. 25.9. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will ſend and take all the families of the north, ſaith the Lord, and Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar the king of Babylon my ſervant, and will bring them againſt this land, and againſt all theſe nations round about:</hi> But I rather think they had fallen into this ſinne ſince their return from Babylon, being ſore corrupted with a very little reſt, as Exra implieth in his prayer, verſ. 8—10. however not onely ſingle perſons but even thoſe that were married offended herein, to the great vexation of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wives, Mal. 2.11, 13. <hi>Judah hath profaned the holineſſe of the Lord, which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a ſtrange god—And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the Lord with tears,</hi> &amp;c. which is meant of the tears of their firſt wives; and ſo farre was this corruption ſpread at preſent, that amongſt others, even the ſonnes of Joſhua the ſonne of Jozadak were in the tranſgreſſion, chap. 10.18. <hi>And among the ſonnes of the priests there were found that had ſtrange wives, namely, of the ſonnes of Joſhua the ſonne of Jozadak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>The hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this treſpaſſe.]</hi> That is, they which ſhould have reſtrained the people from this wickedneſſe have had the chiefeſt hand in it, to wit, as having been boldeſt in this tranſgreſſion, and ringleaders to the reſt of the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3, <hi>I rent my garment, and my mantle,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, both the coat that was girded cloſe to his body, and the looſe mantle which he wore over that, and this doubtleſſe is thus expreſſed, to ſhew how paſſionately grieved and offended he was to hear that his brethren had thus groſſely tranſgreſſed the law of God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this cuſtome of rending their garments, ſee Gen. 37.20.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Then were aſſembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems the report being quickly carried about, how mightily Ezra was afflicted and diſpleaſed, when he heard how his brethren had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wives of the idolatrous nations; ſo many of the godly inhabitants that heard
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:42229:386"/>
of it, being themſelves afraid of the judgements of God threatned in his word, came preſently in to him, partly to comfort him, and partly to adviſe with him what was fit to be done; which is the rather here inſerted, to make way to that which follows (which is added yet further, to ſet forth how mightily he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with theſe tydings) <hi>And I ſate aſtonied untill the evening ſacrifice:</hi> though the brethren came in, it is like to comfort him, yet neither there preſence nor any thing they could ſay, did any whit move him, but till the evening ſacrifice there he ſate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, like one that had neither life nor ſoule in him; ſo overwhelmed he was with grief and aſtoniſhment at that which had been told him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Having rent my garment, and my mantle, I fell upon my knees,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, having before rent my garments, verſ. 3. in that ſad plight I fell down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my knees before the people, and prayed unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 6. <hi>Our iniquities are increaſed over our head,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, we are even drowned over head and eares in ſinne; the expreſſion is much like that, Pſalme 38.4. <hi>mine iniquities are gone over my head,</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe is the next clauſe alſo, and <hi>our treſpaſſe is grown up unto the heavens,</hi> that is, it is as great as may be, and ſuch as muſt needs make a loud cry in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens for judgement to be poured forth upon us.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>As it is this day.]</hi> Having ſaid that they had been delivered <hi>to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, and to a ſpoil, and to confuſion of face,</hi> he addes, <hi>as it is this day,</hi> becauſe ſome of them were ſtill in captivity, and the reſt that were returned, were in a low and ſad condition, and lay under a great deal of ſhame and reproach.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And now for a little ſpace grace hath been ſhewed from the Lord our God,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added as an aggravation of their ſinne, that having been but a while freed from thoſe puniſhments which their former ſinnes had brought upon them, they ſhould ſo ſoon venture to expoſe themſelves to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To leave us a remnant to eſcape, and to give us a nail in his holy place,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe words Ezra ſheweth wherein grace had been ſhewed them from the Lord their God, to wit, firſt, in that he had left them <hi>a remnant to eſcape,</hi> whereas he might juſtly have deſtroyed them all, he had preſerved a ſeed a remnant that were delivered out of their captivity, and brought back again into their own countrey: Secondly, that he had given them a <hi>nail in his holy place,</hi> whereby it meant either that God had given them a prince of their own nation, to wit, Zerubbabel (for the princes and magiſtrates are compared to pinnes and nails, becauſe the ſafety of their kingdome depends upon them, and the good ſucceſſe of their great affairs, reſt much upon their wiſedome and care; whence is that which the Lord ſaith of Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim, Iſaiah 22.23, 24. <hi>And I will faſten him as a nail in a ſure place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers houſe:</hi> or elſe that he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them ſome prop and ſupport of their faith and hope, ſomething that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to wait for ſome better dayes then yet they had ſeen; or elſe rather that he had in ſome meaſure ſettled them again, and given them a reſting place in his holy land, city, and Temple: the metaphor is taken from the pinnes and nails wherewith they uſed to faſten the cords of their tents in the earth when they went to pitch their tents, as intending to abide a while in that place; or elſe from thoſe nails
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:42229:387"/>
wherewith we uſe to faſten any thing and which we ſtrike into our walls to hang, things upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.]</hi> To wit, by refreſhing our hearts, according to that which is ſaid of Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, when in his faintneſſe he was refreſhed with eating a little honey, 1. Sam. 14.29. <hi>See I pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened, becauſe I taſted a little of this honey:</hi> or by reſtoring us to life, who were in our ſlavery and captivity in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, as men dead and buried. Ezek. 37.12. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cauſe you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>To ſet up the houſe of our God, and to repair the deſolations thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] Two particulars are here mentioned, wherein Ezra acknowledged that God had intended mercy to them in the ſight of the kings of Perſia, and wherewith he had thereupon revived their hearts, as it is ſaid in the foregoing words, to wit, Firſt, that they had liberty given them <hi>to ſet up the houſe of God, and to repair the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof;</hi> where, by repairing the deſolations of Gods houſe is meant, both the repairing of the Temples ruines, and alſo principally, the renewing of the joyfull aſſemblies of Gods people, and the ſacred imployments of his worſhip and ſervice there: And ſecondly, that there was given them <hi>a wall in Judah and Jeruſalem,</hi> that is ſome protection and defence againſt their enemies, as a wall or penne to a flock of ſheep. The walls of Jeruſalem were not yet built, and therefore it cannot be meant of them, but by the wall given them, is meant the fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of them from dangers, partly by the king of Perſias favour, who had granted them his royall protection againſt thoſe enemies that formerly would not ſuffer them to proceed in building the houſe of their God, and partly by Gods awing their ſpirits, that they durſt not oppoſe what the king had commanded.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And now, O our God, what ſhall we ſay after this?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this great goodneſſe and mercy thou haſt ſhowen unto us, what ſhall we ſay, that notwithſtanding all this we ſhould again forſake thy commandments as we have done?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>O Lord God of Iſrael thou art righteous, for we remained yet eſcaped, as it is this day,</hi> &amp;c.] Either the drift of theſe words is to ſhew that continuing in this condition they were now in, they could expect no other, but to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and that becauſe God was righteous though he had ſpared them, and they ſtood guilty of a groſſe ſinne: or elſe, in this concluſion of his prayer, Ezra juſtifies God, and layes all the blame upon themſelves; ſo intimating, that all their hope was in his goodneſſe and mercy, and readineſſe to forgive poore penitent ſinners: as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>O Lord thou art righteous</hi> in all thy dealing with us, what thou haſt inflicted upon us hath been juſtly inflicted; yea of thine own mercy, and according to thy righteouſneſſe and faithfulneſſe in performing thy gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thou haſt reſerved a remnant of us: But as for us we are here before thee, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting indeed for thy mercy, but in our ſinnes, and ſo deſerving to be deſtroyed; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven becauſe of this wickedneſſe which lyeth upon us, if thou ſhouldeſt enter into judgement with us, we are not able to ſtand it out and to abide the tryall.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THere aſſembled unto him out of Iſrael, a very great congregation,</hi> &amp;c.] Ezra having in publick before the Temple, to wit, in the outer court manifeſted ſuch wonderfull affliction of mind, and ſorrow for the ſinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by rending his garments, yea, the hair of his head and beard, caſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf groveling upon the ground, weeping and wailing, calling and crying upon God for mercie, as a man aſtoniſhed and diſtracted with grief, and that no doubt purpoſely to diſcover to the people the grievouſneſſe of their ſinne, and the danger they were in becauſe thereof; the noiſe hereof was ſoon carried throughout the citie, and preſently there came in to him of thoſe that were afraid of thoſe judgements threatned in the word of God againſt them for this ſinne, ſome few at firſt, chap. 9.4. but now at laſt a very great aſſembly of them, who being affected with Ezraes grievous lamentation, did alſo weep very ſore with him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Yet now there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.]</hi> That is, there is hope that God may be reconciled to the people that are called by his name, if we uſe the means that he hath appointed; namely, if we believe, and repent, and forſake our ſinnes, and put away the ſtrange wives that are amongſt us, and this too, there is great hope the people will be wonne to do.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Let us make a covenant with our God, to put away all the wives, and ſuch as are born of them,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the courſe which Shechaniah propounds to Ezra for the pacifying of Gods wrath: namely, that they ſhould put away their ſtrange wives and the children that were born of them; and two particulars he addes concerning the manner of doing this, that Ezra might the readily approve of it; to wit, firſt, that it ſhould be commended to the people by the advice of Ezra, and thoſe other godly Iſraelites that were now aſſembled to him, which we have in thoſe words; <hi>according to the counſel of my Lord, and thoſe that tremble at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of our God;</hi> and thus he intimates too for Ezraes incouragement, that thoſe that were religiouſly affected, &amp; were afraid of Gods judgements becauſe of this ſin, would willingly joyn in promoting this work: and ſecondly, that they ſhould man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage this great buſineſſe, according to the warrant &amp; direction of Gods Law; <hi>and let it be done according to the Law:</hi> and hereby I conceive it is evident, that where the Law did forbid the Jews to marry any infidell remaining an infidell, as Deut. 7.3. and Exod. 34.16. it did alſo by neceſſary conſequence enjoyn thoſe that had married ſuch wives, to put them away, and in ſome ſence their children alſo. Indeed the judgement of Expoſitours is different conerning their way of doing this: for ſome conceive that their wives were put away as no lawfull wives, becauſe their marrying them was not warrantable by Gods Law: and again, others think that they were put away by bills of divorce, which they ſay was principally intended in that clauſe, <hi>and let it be done according to the Law.</hi> But now for their children born of ſuch wives, though ſome conceive that they alſo were caſt off as illegitimate, and born by unlawfull copulation, and turned out of their families, the rather that the ſight of them might not by degrees winne them to receive back their mothers again; yet this I can by no means approve, for though it ſhould be granted that ſuch children were to be eſteemed as baſtards, yet ſurely their fathers were to provide for them; and
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:42229:388"/>
therefore by putting away the children born of ſuch wives, nothing elſe is meant, but that they were declared no true free-born members of the people of Iſrael; which may be confirmed by this, that in Nehemiahs reformation, that place Deut. 23.3. <hi>An Ammonite or Moabite ſhall not enter the congregation of the Lord:</hi> is alledged as the ground why <hi>they ſeparated from Iſrael all the mixed multitude,</hi> Neh. 13.1.3. concerning which, ſee the notes there; and queſtionleſſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of theſe children maintained and brought them up, and took care that they might be inſtructed in the truth, to the end, that afterwards as Proſelytes they might be joyned to the people of God; but however, that this at the moſt was but a part of Moſes politie, a Law not in force now, many gather from that of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 7.12, 13. <hi>If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with him, let him not put her away,</hi> &amp;c. and again, 1. Pet. 3.1. <hi>Likewiſe, ye wives be in ſubjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they alſo may without the word be wonne by the converſation of the wives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Then Ezra roſe up from before the houſe of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the ſonne of Eliaſhib.]</hi> Eliaſhib was the ſonne of Joiakim, and grandchild of Jeſhua the high prieſt, Neh. 12.10. <hi>And Jeſhua begat Joiakim, and Joiakim begat Eliaſhib, and Eliaſhib begat Joiada:</hi> and was himſelf high prieſt in Nehemiahs time, Neh. 3.1. <hi>Then Eliaſhib the high priest roſe up with his brethren the prieſts,</hi> &amp;c.] Johanan therefore his ſonne, was doubtleſſe of chief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count amongſt the prieſts at this time; and for this cauſe it ſeems Ezra went into his chamber, that there with the princes he might conſult how to effect that reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to which the forementioned aſſembly had ſworn to yield.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>All his ſubſtance ſhould be forfeited, and himſelf ſeparated from the congregation,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, excommunicated from the number of Gods people, and this was the puniſhment denounced againſt thoſe that would not come to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that Ezra had called.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin, gathered themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, all that inhabited in the land of Judah and Benjamin, for there were many of the ten tribes that were come from Babylon, chap. 1.5. who doubtleſſe came now to this meeting together with thoſe of Judah and Benjamin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was the ninth moneth, and the twentieth day of the moneth,</hi> &amp;c.] Which was about the beginning of our December, a time uſually of much cold and rain, and thence is that which follows, <hi>And all the people ſate in the ſtreets of the houſe of God:</hi> that is, in the place of the outer court, which was it may be not yet walled in, <hi>trembling becauſe of this matter, and for the great rain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Then all tht congregation anſwered, and ſaid with a loud voice, As thou haſt ſaid, ſo muſt we do.]</hi> Yet within a few years they returned to this there vomit again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Let now our rulers of all the congregation ſtand,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, let the ſupreme rulers of all Iſrael, to wit, the Sanhedrim be appointed to ſit dayly here in Jeruſalem, for the hearing of this buſineſſe; namely, who they were that had married ſtrange wives that had not embraced the faith of Iſrael, or that were ſince their marriage relapſed to idolatry, and let thoſe that are found guiltie in every citie, be brought hither in their turns to appear before them, and with them the Elders and
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:42229:388"/>
judges of every citie to teſtifie againſt them, and to make affidavit, that upon diligent ſearch and enquiry made, theſe and theſe onely have been found guilty, and ſo let the buſineſſe be diſpatched firſt with the inhabitants of one citie, and then with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther untill at length all the ſtrange wives be put away, and ſo the fierce wrath of our God may be turned away from us.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Onely Jonathan the ſonne of Aſahel, and Jahaziah the ſonne of Tik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, were employed about this matter,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, beſides thoſe mentioned, verſ. 14. the rulers of all the congregation, which is in Jeruſalem to ſit in judgement, and the Elders and judges in every citie, who uſed after diligent ſearch made, to bring thoſe they found faulty before them, and the other rulers in Jeruſalem; theſe foure here mentioned were it ſeems choſen for this particular buſineſſe in hand, either to joyn with that high Senate in Jeruſalem; or elſe as officers to give order and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the managing of this matter in their ſeverall cities, or to prepare and fit buſineſſe for the hearing of the rulers, and two of theſe were Levites, that if any doubtfull caſe happened, they might inform them what the meaning of the Law in that caſe was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And they made an end with all the men that had taken ſtrange wives, by the firſt day of the first moneth.]</hi> And ſo were three whole moneths employed about it: for they begin to ſit about this buſineſſe the firſt day of the tenth moneth, as it is ſaid in the foregoing verſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18, <hi>And among the ſonnes of the priests, there were found that had taken strange wives; namely, of the ſonnes of Jeſhua the ſonne of Jozadak.]</hi> Who was the high prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And being guilty, the offered a ramme of their flock for the trespaſſe.]</hi> The like muſt be underſtood alſo of the reſt, though of each it be not expreſſed.</p>

                     <hi>In the moneth of Chiſleu, in the twentieth yeare, as I was in Shuſhan the palace,</hi> &amp;c.] Chiſleu was their ninth moneth, containing part of our November and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember; which is therefore obſervable, becauſe hereby it appears that Hanani and his brethren, that were come now into Perſia to Nehemiah, undertook their journey upon ſome buſineſſe, as is moſt likely, for the good of the Church and people of God, even in the depth of winter: By the twentieth yeare here mentioned, is meant the twentieth yeare of the reigne of Artaxerxes, for ſo much is expreſſed, chap. 2.1. <hi>And it came to paſſe in the moneth Niſan, in the twentieth yeare of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes the king</hi> &amp;c. and that it was Artaxerxes Mnemon, or rather that Artaxerxes who is called Longimanus or Longhand, becauſe one of his hands was longer then the other, the ſame in whoſe ſeventh yeare Ezra went down to Jeruſalem, as is noted. Ezra 7.1. and not Xerxes as ſome would have it; we may the rather think, becauſe there is mention made of the two and thirtieth yeare of this Artaxerxes, chap. 13.6. whereas no hiſtorians reckon above one and twenty years of the reigne of Xerxes. As for the <hi>palace of Shuſhan,</hi> where Nehemiah was when Hanani and his brethren came to him, thereby is meant the palace of the citie Shuſhan, for Shuſhan was one of the chief cities in Perſia, Eſther 3.15. <hi>The city Shuſhan was perplexed,</hi> and Hanani being one of the kings officers lived with him in the palace; yet it may be the palace was peculiarly called Shuſhan, as the citie alſo was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>The remnant that are left of the captivitie there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, their neighbours round about them do exceedingly deſpiſe them and wrong them; to which theſe Jews adde as the reaſon of this, <hi>the wall of Jeruſalem alſo is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire,</hi> that is, as Nebuchadnezzar left them long ago, ſo they ſtill continue; and this makes the enemies proudly to inſult over them, and diſables them to defend themſelves againſt them: Some conceive thas Ezra had built the walls, and that the neighbouring nations had ſince done this miſchief; but then it is likely they would have burnt the whole citie, if not the Temple too.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>I ſate down and wept, and mourned certain dayes, and fasted, and prayed

                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And have not kept the commandments nor the ſtatutes nor the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, neither the morall, ceremoniall, nor judiciall lawes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Though there were of you cast out into the uttermost part of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet will I gather them from thence.]</hi> The meaning of theſe words is, that though they were ſcattercd to the remoteſt parts of the earth, yet God would bring them back from thence; but becauſe at the utmoſt extent of ſo much of the earth as mans eye can at any time ſee, the heavens ſeem to touch the earth, and to cover it round about, as with a half globe, hence is this expreſſion of being <hi>caſt out unto the uttermoſt part of the heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Proſper I pray thee thy ſervant this day, and grant him mercy in the ſight of this man.]</hi> That is, Artaxerxes, who was but a man though a king, and therefore his heart was in Gods hand, as other mens are.</p>

                     <hi>For I was the kings cup-bearer.]</hi> This he addes, to ſhew what intereſt he had in the king, to encourage him to move the king in this buſineſſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd it came to paſſe in the moneth Niſan, in the twentieth yeare of Artaxerxes the king,</hi> &amp;c.] Niſan was their firſt moneth; this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſome foure moneths after he firſt hard by Hanani of the diſtreſſe of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Jeruſalem, which was in the moneth of Chiſleu, the ninth moneth, chap. 1.1. all which time it ſeemeth, he continued weeping, and faſting, and praying, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting till his turn came of attending in the court, in his office of cup-bearer; for that this was the cauſe of his ſo long ſilence, is me thinks evident: Firſt, becauſe had he all this while miniſtred to the king, it is likely the king would have diſcerned his ſadneſſe and heavineſſe before this time: And ſecondly, becauſe he would doubtleſſe before this have made known his requeſt to the king. This moneth Niſan contained part of our March and part of April; whence it appears that Nehemiahs journey was in the ſpring of the yeare.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Wherefore the king ſaid unto me, Why is thy countenance ſad?</hi> &amp;c.] And indeed if we conſider that his ſorrow and grief for the ſad eſtate of his brethren, had been ſo long a time accompanied with much watching and faſting and prayer, it is no wonder thought the king preſently diſcerned the alteration of his countenance, from that it had formerly wont to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then I was very ſore afraid.]</hi> To wit, leſt the king ſhould ſuſpect ſome evil or treacherous purpoſe foſtered in his heart, in which caſe guiltineſſe of conſcience doth uſually diſtract the mind, and make the countenance pale and wan: (and therefore perhaps it was that he anſwered preſently, verſ. 3. <hi>Let the king live for ever,</hi> not onely becauſe it was the uſuall form of ſalutation when they were to ſpeak to
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:42229:390"/>
kings, but alſo becauſe he deſired to aſſure him of his faithfull intentions towards him) or elſe rather, leſt being preſſed to diſcover the ground of his ſorrow in ſuch a publick preſence (for the queen was by, verſ. 6. and therefore many alſo of his princes and nobles) if he ſhould make no anſwer that might increaſe their jealouſie of him, and if he ſhould make known the cauſe of his grief, he might well doubt how his requeſt would be taken, either by the king or his courtiers, or what inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might follow thereupon; for both the greatneſſe of the requeſt he had to make, and the majeſtie of the king might in theſe regards be dreadfull to him. To this ſome adde alſo, that he might fear the kings diſpleaſure, becauſe it was not lawfull for any mourner to come into the preſence of the kings of Perſia: and indeed it is, ſaid, Eſther 4.2. <hi>That none might enter into the kings gates clothed with ſackeloth;</hi> but whether it can be hence inferred that none that were heavie and ſad might ſtand before the king, it may well be queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Why ſhould not my countenance be ſad, when the citie the place of my fathers ſepulchres lyeth waste,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the city where they lived and dyed: This argument taken from natural compaſſion, was moſt like to prevail with an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then king.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>If it pleaſe the king, and if thy ſervant hath found favour in thy ſight, that thou wouldest ſend me unto Judah,</hi> &amp;c. Hereby he ſeeks to intimate to the king, that it was his former favour to him that emboldened him to make this requeſt, and that he deſired it with a reſolution however to ſubmit to his will, and onely ſought it ſo farre as he ſhould like well of the motion, to approve it as reaſonable and fitting.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the king ſaid unto me (the queen alſo ſitting by him) For how long,</hi> &amp;c.] The queens ſitting by is mentioned, not onely becauſe the relation of ſuch particular circumſtances, are good proofs of the truth of that which is related, but alſo happely to intimate that ſhe was one that favoured Nehemiah, and did what ſhe might to further his ſuit; which hath made ſome Expoſitours conceive that this was Eſther the wife of Ahaſuerus, but however in this queſtion which the king pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to Nehemiah, <hi>For how long ſhall thy journey be? and when wilt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurn?</hi> he diſcovered his love to him, and that he was loth he ſhould be too long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I ſet him a time.]</hi> Some Expoſitours conceive that the time he prefixed for his return was after twelve years, becauſe it is evident that ſo long he was governour of the province of Judea under Artaxerxes, to wit, chap. 5.14. <hi>From the twentieth yeare even unto the two and thirtieth yeare of Artaxerxes the king, which is twelve years,</hi> &amp;c. but firſt, becauſe the king demanding when he would return, as being loth he ſhould be too long from him, it is not probable he would prefixe ſo long a time: and ſecondly, becauſe the building of the walls of Jeruſalem, the work for which chiefly he now went, was finiſhed in leſſe then two moneths, chap. 6.15. <hi>in fifty and two dayes,</hi> more probable it is that at preſent he ſet a ſhorter time, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did return; but then went again with commiſſion of being governour there, and was their governour twelve years, though happely in that time alſo he often went to Artaxerxes into Perſia.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Let letters be given me to the governours beyond the river; that they
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:42229:390"/>
may convey me over till I come into Judah.]</hi> This Ezra would not deſire when he went to Jeruſalem, becauſe they had then occaſionally ſpoken to the king of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of their God over thoſe that ſerved him; and therefore if he had deſired a guard of ſouldiers, he ſuſpected they would have derided his former boaſting in Gods defence and protection, Ezra 8.22. <hi>For I was aſhamed to require of the king a band of ſouldiers and horſmen, to help us againſt the enemy in the way, becauſe we had ſpoken unto the king, ſaying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that ſeek him.</hi> But now Nehemiah not ſuſpecting any ſuch thing, nor having happely that cauſe to ſuſpect it, required a ſafe conduct, and that no doubt lawfully.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And a letter unto Aſaph the keeper of the kings forreſt, that he may give me timber,</hi> &amp;c.] This forreſt of the kings out of which Nehemiah deſired timber, was doubtleſſe the forreſt of Lebanon, out of which Solomon had formerly his timber, 1. Kings 5.6. and this timber he deſired was for beams; firſt, for the gates of <hi>the palace which appertained to the houſe,</hi> that is, the Temple; whereby either the building about the outward court is meant (for though the Temple was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed before, yet happely the gates and towers that belonged thereto were not ſet up,) or elſe rather, the palace, wherein formerly the kings of Judah dwelt, which was in a manner joyned to the Temple, and therefore may here be called <hi>the palace that appertained to the houſe:</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>for the wall of the citie,</hi> that is, the gates in ſeverall parts of the wall: and thirdly, for a dwelling houſe for himſelf, <hi>for the houſe,</hi> ſaith Nehemiah, <hi>that I ſhall enter into.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Now the king had ſent the captains of the army, and horſmen with me.]</hi> To wit, to conduct him ſafe to the river Euphrates; from whence afterward he was by the governours beyond the river, conveyed to Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the ſervant heard of it,</hi> &amp;c.] Sanballat is called <hi>the Horonite,</hi> as it is thought, becauſe he was the deputy Lieutenant of the Moabites: for Horonaim was a chief city in the land of Moab, Iſaiah 15.5. <hi>My heart ſhall cry out for Moab,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for in the way of Horonaim they ſhall raiſe up a cry of deſtruction:</hi> and Jerem. 48.3, 4. <hi>A voice of crying ſhall be from Horanaim, ſpoiling, and great deſtruction; Moab is destroyed,</hi> &amp;c. and Tobiah is called <hi>the ſervant the Ammonite,</hi> either becauſe he had been a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a ſlave, however now he was in high place and eſteem; or elſe, becauſe now he was now the deputy Lieutenant, the kings vaſſal or ſervant, amongſt the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites: Now this Tobiah becauſe his wife was a Jewiſh, had ever and anon adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of their affairs, and ſo wrought them great trouble.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>So I came to Jeruſalem, and was there three dayes.]</hi> That is, ſo long he reſted himſelf after his journey. The like is noted of Ezra, Ezra 8.31, 32.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And I aroſe in the night, I and ſome few men with me, neither told I any man,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that he might view the ruines of the walls round about, and the circuit of the city, and ſo might conſider, what likelyhood there was, that they ſhould go be able to go through with the work, what proviſion it was fit ſhould be made for the accompliſhment thereof, and what places were moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be firſt, and with moſt ſpeed repaired: all which he deſired to be informed of with all ſecrecy, before any body knew of his purpoſe, that he might be the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:42229:391"/>
to anſwer any thing objected, when it was propounded; and that there might be no talk of it till they were ready to ſet upon it, leſt the enemies ſhould do any thing to hinder them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither was there any beast with me ſave the beaſt that I rode upon.]</hi> To wit, purpoſely to avoid noiſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And I went out by night, by the gate of the valley,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the manner of Nehemiahs going about the citie is deſcribed, to wit, that taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the night for the greater ſecreſie, as is before ſaid (and a moonſhinie night it muſt needs be; for elſe he could not have ſeen in what condition the walls were) firſt he went out at <hi>the gate of the valley, which was before the Dragon well</hi> (ſo called as we may probably conceive, becauſe of ſome ſtatue of a Dragon there made, out of the mouth whereof the water came running out) and this ſome take to be the gate on the eaſt-ſide of the citie that led to the valley of Jehoſhaphat, mentioned Joel 3.2. and others the weſtern-gate, which was near to <hi>the valley of dead bodies,</hi> of which the Prophet ſpeaks Jer. 31.40. and ſecondly, that from thence he went <hi>to the dung-port,</hi> that is, the gate through which they carried the dung out of the citie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the kings pool.]</hi> That is, to the gate which led to the fountain of Gihon, that ranne into the kings pool, that is, the pool of Siloah, or Siloam, as it is called, John 9.11. for the gate of the fountain and the pool of Siloah are joyned together, chap. 3.15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>But the gates of the fountain repaired Shallum, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the kings gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> and it was it ſeems called the kings pool, either becauſe it joyned to the kings gardens, chap. 3.15. or rather becauſe it was made by Hezekiah when he turned the water courſe of Gihon thither, and ſo from thence into the citie, 2. Chron. 32.30. <hi>Hezekiah alſo ſtopped the water courſe of Gihon, and brought it ſtreight down on the weſt-ſide of the citie of David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And turned back, and entred by the gate of the valley, and ſo return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed]</hi> Out of which he went firſt, verſ. 13. ſo that he either went round about the citie; or elſe, not finding the way paſſable when he came to the kings pool, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back the ſame way he came, and ſo went again into the citie to his lodgings.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Nether had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the prieſts, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the reſt that did the work.]</hi> That is, the workmen that were afterward employed in the work, he did not ſo much as carry them with him to ask their advice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the ſervant the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monite, and Geſhem the Arabian heard it, they laughed us to ſcorn,</hi> &amp;c.] To San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat and Tobiah, mentioned before, verſ. 10. here is another added that joyned with them in oppoſing Nehemiah, to wit, <hi>Geſhem the Arabian,</hi> that is, the king of Perſias deputy lieutenant amongſt the Arabians; and though it be ſaid in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, that they charged them with an intent of rebelling againſt the king of Perſia: <hi>What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebell againſt the king?</hi> yet becauſe it is alſo ſaid here before, that they laughed them to ſcorn &amp; deſpiſed them; therefore ſome Expoſitours underſtand thoſe words as ſpoken in a ſcoffing manner, and as it were to imply that they had undertaken a work, which poore wretches they would not be able to effect, and wherein they ſhould be able to hinder them well enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="765" facs="tcp:42229:391"/>Verſ. 20. <hi>But you have no portion, nor right, nor memoriall in Jeruſalem.]</hi> That is, you are appointed governours in other countries; and beſides you have no intereſt in us or in Jeruſalem: neither is there any memoriall of you or your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours to be found among us, and why then do you intermeddle with that which belongs not to you?</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>THen Eliaſhib the high prieſt roſe up with his brethren the priests, and they built the ſheep-gate,</hi> &amp;c.] Eliaſhib was the ſonne of Joiakim, and grandchild of that Jeſhua, who went up at firſt from Babylon with Zerubbabel; and ſo being now high prieſt, with his brethren the prieſts he undertook the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſheep-gate; and that becauſe this gate either joyned to the Temple, or was near to it, and was ſo called from the ſheep-market, which for the conveniency of the Temple was near to it; as was alſo the ſheep-pool, called <hi>Betheſda,</hi> John. 5.2. where the ſheep were waſhed appointed for ſacrifices, before they were brought into the Temple. As for theſe following words, <hi>they ſanctified it, and ſet up the doores of it,</hi> the meaning is, that firſt they cleared it from the rubbiſh and ruines wherein it lay: ſecondly, that they repaired it, and raiſed it up again in its former beauty and ſplendour: and thirdly, having finiſhed it they did then by prayer dedicate it to the Lord, and in it, as the firſt fruits, all the reſt of the building, deſiring him to uphold and maintain it againſt all the adverſaries of Judah and Jeruſalem. Indeed to this ſome adde that it was alſo ſanctified by the prieſts working upon it, in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it gained the more reſpect: but though I doubt not but ſome of the prieſts might put their hand to ſome part of the work, out of their zeal to the ſervice, and for the encouragement of the people; yet I conceive both here and elſewhere in this chapter the building of the gates and wall is aſcribed to thoſe that bore the charge of the work, that did not work themſelves, but at moſt did onely overſee it, and take care that it was done: and this the prieſts did not onely for the ſheep gate it ſelf, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for a good part of the wall adjoyning <hi>even to the tower of Meah they ſanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel,</hi> where by <hi>the tower of Meah</hi> is meant a tower not farre from the ſheep-gate, ſo called as is thought, becauſe it had an hundred pinacles, or was an hundred cubits high, or ſome ſuch like reaſon (for <hi>Meah</hi> ſignifies an <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>) and by the tower of Hananeel a tower further northward, mentioned again Zach. 14.10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>But the fiſh gate did the ſonnes of Haſſenaah build]</hi> This was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe on the northweſt of Jeruſalem in the citie of David, towards the ſea, as appears alſo by that which is ſaid of Manaſſeh, 2. Chron. 33.14. <hi>He built a wall without the citie of David, on the weſt ſide of Gihon in the valley, even to the entring in of the fiſh gate,</hi> &amp;c. It was called <hi>the fiſh gate,</hi> becauſe they brought in their fiſh from the ſea coaſts of Tyre and Sydon at that gate, according to that, chap. 13.16. <hi>There dwelt men of Tyre therein which alſo brought fiſh,</hi> &amp;c. and had happely their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for the ſelling of their fiſh not farre from it: it is mentioned again, Zeph. 1.10, <hi>There ſhall be the noiſe of a cry from the fiſh gate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And next unto them the Tekoites repaired,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſome of the inhabitants of Tekoa, for other of them alſo repaired in another place, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:42229:392"/>
afterward, verſ. 27. but yet it was onely the common people amongſt them that did what was done; for concerning their nobles, there is a clauſe of exception added, <hi>but the nobles put not their necks to the work of the Lord,</hi> that is, the nobles would not do any ſervice herein to their Lord the God of Iſrael, becauſe their arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie in regard of their greatneſſe was the cauſe of their refuſing their help in this work, as pretending they would not be taxed, nor have any ſuch burthen impoſed upon them: their folly is noted herein, that they refuſed to put their necks to his work, who is the nobles Lord as well as the common peoples.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Moreover, the old gate repaired Jehoiada.]</hi> So called happely becauſe it was the oldeſt of all the gates in Jeruſalem; and this was alſo, as is generally held, on the north-ſide of Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And next unto them repaired Melatiah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>unto the throne of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour on this ſide the river.]</hi> It ſeems there was formerly in this part of the wall a palace or place of judicature, where thoſe that were appointed governours under the Babylonian and Perſian kings over all the countrey on this ſide Euphrates, did uſe to ſit in judgement; unto which place theſe men of Gibeah and Mizpah and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers here mentioned did repair the wall: and that palace where had been the throne of the governour, ſome Expoſitours conceive, was repaired by Nehemiah and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (he being now governour of Judea) whence are thoſe expreſſions, chap. 4.16. <hi>The half of my ſervants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the ſhields,</hi> &amp;c. and 5.16. <hi>I continued in the work of this wall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And they fortified Jeruſalem unto the broad wall.]</hi> That is, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the wall unto that place where the wall was made much broader then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and therefore called <hi>the broad wall;</hi> and ſo having brought the work ſo farre, there they left off building, becauſe here it was not ruined, and therefore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no repairing; in which ſence it may be read according to the tranſlation noted in the margin, <hi>They left Jeruſalem unto the broad wall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the ſonne of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jeruſalem.]</hi> For Jeruſalem, being part in Judah and part in Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, had accordingly two ſeverall rulers; and this Rephaiah was ruler of one of them, and Shallum, verſ. 12. was ruler of the other.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Haſhub the ſonne of Pahath-moab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.]</hi> That is, the next portion of the wall ſet out to be repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherein alſo was <hi>the tower of the furnaces,</hi> ſo called happely, becauſe either in the tower it ſelf, or in the ſtreet adjoyning there were many furnaces.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Shallum the ſonne of Haloeſh the ruler of the half part of Jeruſalem.]</hi> See above, verſ. 9.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>The valley gate repaired Hanun,</hi> &amp;c.] See chap. 2.13.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun.]</hi> See chap. 2.14.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>After him repaired Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c.] Here begins the repairing of the wall about mount Zion, wherein ſtood the Temple and the palace of the kings of
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:42229:392"/>
Judah; and the firſt part of this wall was repaired by one <hi>Nehemiah the ſonne of Azbuck the ruler of the half part of Bethzur,</hi> and ſo as farre as to <hi>the pool that was made, and unto the houſe of the mighty;</hi> and by <hi>the pool that was made,</hi> is meant a pool not naturall, but made by art, to wit, by Hezekiah, 2. Kings 20.20. yet this was not the pool of Siloah mentioned in the former verſe (for that was happely a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall pool, and was in the lower part of Jeruſalem) but another in mount Zion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therefore <hi>the upper pool,</hi> 2.

The work of the Nethinims was to carry wood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Temple; and therefore it was the more convenient for them to dwell in Ophel, which was ſo nigh to the water gate.</p>

<pb n="768" facs="tcp:42229:393"/>
the art of horſe riding, or becauſe they went uſually with their horſes out of that gate to water them in the brook Kidron, or to breath them in the valley of Gehinnom: yet there was a gate alſo called by the ſame name in the kings pallace as we may ſee, 2. Chron. 23.15. <hi>when ſhe was come to the entring of the horſe-gate by the kings houſe,</hi> &amp;c. which is thus expreſſed, 2.

                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Even that which they built, if a fox go up, he ſhall even break down their ſtone wall.]</hi> Becauſe foxes uſe in the night to ſcrape through walls of earth, that they may come to their prey; Tobiah in theſe words, to ſcoff at the weakneſſe of the walls which they could make in ſuch haſte, ſaith, that when they had done the moſt they could, if they did finiſh them, they would be ſo ſlightly done, that a fox might make a way through them, or ſcrape them down.</p>

                     <hi>And give them for a prey in the land of captivity.]</hi> Let them be carried away ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, and there made a prey to their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their ſinne be blotted out from before thee.]</hi> That is, let not their iniquity paſſe unpuniſhed: for he doth not pray againſt their converſion, but deſires the Lord, that in caſe they proceeded on in this their impiety, he would manifeſt his wrath by powring his judgements upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.]</hi> That is, in reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the builders of thy citie, imployed by thy appointment, they have reproached thee: ſo that we deſire them to be puniſhed, not out of any private grudge or deſire of revenge, but that thy glory may be vindicated.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>So built we the wall; and all the wail was joyned together unto the half thereof.]</hi> That is unto the half height thereof.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Judah ſaid, The ſtrength of the bearers of burdens is decaied, and there is much rubbiſh,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the men of Judah alſo began to murmure and complain, that by reaſon there was ſtill ſo much rubbiſh, and the ſtrength of the bearers of the burdens was ſo much decayed, they ſhould never be able to go through with the work, at leaſt not make it defenſible, ere the enemies would ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; for if the trench about the wall, the chief help to keep off the enemy were not cleared of the rubbiſh, all they had done would be to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>When the Jews that dwelt by them, came, they ſaid unto us ten times,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, oftentimes: ſee the note, Gen. 31.7. Though theſe Jews, that dwelt amongſt the Samaritanes, and thoſe other neighbouring nations, that now banded together againſt the building of Jeruſalems walls, durſt not joyn themſelves with their brethren to help them in their work; yet ſecretly it ſeems ſome of them came to Jeruſalem, to inform them of the conſpiracy of their enemies againſt them. As for the intelligence they brought them, ſome conceive that the wayes that led from Jeruſalem to Samaria, are intended in thoſe words: <hi>from all places whence ye ſhall return unto us, they will be upon you.</hi> But others, and I think more probably, underſtand it of all places about the city, from whence the builders of the wall ſhould return into the citie, where the Jews were when they gave them this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <hi>from all places whence ye ſhall return unto us, they will be upon you;</hi> that is, they will on a ſuddain beſet the city, and aſſault it on every ſide; when you ſhall leave your work and return to us into the city, either to eat or to reſt and refreſh your ſelves from the ſeverall places round about the city, where you are now imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in building the walls, on a ſudden they will break in upon us.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Therefore ſet I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, hearing by the conſonant report of our brethren that came from ſeverall places, that our adverſaries had a purpoſe to aſſault us, I cauſed the people to give over their work, and to arm themſelves to keep off the enemy; and to that end I ſet ſome of them beneath behind the wall, and others above in the towers and other fortifications, to beat off the adverſaries, and keep them from entring the citie.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>We returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.]</hi> That is, when the enemies, hearing that their purpoſe was diſcovered, gave over their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded invaſion of the city, and ſo their counſell was brought to nought, we having notice thereof returned to our work; which was a while given over, that we
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:42229:394"/>
might be in a readineſſe to withſtand the enemies if they had come againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>The half of my ſervants wrought in the work,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though we returned to our work again, when we heard that the enemy had given over their plot of coming ſuddenly upon us to fight againſt us; yet after this we were the more carefull to be in a readineſſe to reſiſt them, leſt they ſhould again at ſome other time renew their conſpiracie; to which end, firſt, there was never but half of my ſervants (that is my houſhold ſervants and guard, or trained bands, whoſe captain Nehemiah was) employed in building the wall; the other half ſtood alwayes ready armed to keep off the enemy if occaſion ſhould be: and ſecondly, even thoſe that were employed in building were alſo alwayes armed, as is expreſſed; verſ. 17. <hi>They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens with thoſe that laded; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the rulers were behind all the houſe of Judah.]</hi> To wit, to overſee them, and encourage them in their work, and ſometimes perhaps when need was to help them too.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.]</hi> That is, even they alſo that wrought in the building were alſo alwayes armed, ready at all aſſayes to have joyned with the reſt in reſiſting the enemy if he had ſet upon them: literally this cannot be underſtood; for how could they build the wall or lay burdens upon the ſhoulders of thoſe that bare them, and yet all the while hold their weapons in one of their hands? It is therefore a proverbiall kind of ſpeech, ſignifying onely that whileſt they vvere buſieſt in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they had alſo their weapons ready at hand, to fight againſt the enemy if need were; for ſo Nehemiah explains this phraſe in the following words. verſ. 18. <hi>For the builders had every one his ſword girded by his ſide,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Likewiſe at the ſame time ſaid I unto the people, Let every one with his ſeruant lodge within Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he gave charge to the people that none of them ſhould go out of the city to lodge, and that becauſe he would have them alwayes in a readineſſe to keep their turns, both of watching by night and of working by day.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Saving that every one put them off for waſhing.]</hi> To wit, either their garments or their bodies: for upon occaſion of legall pollutions the Jews did waſh their bodies often.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>THere were that ſaid, We, our ſonnes and our daughters are many: therefore we take up corn for them,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, having a great charge of children, that which we earn will not maintain us; and therefore we are conſtrained, whileſt we work for the publick, to take up corn upon uſe of the nobles, and rulers, and rich men amongſt us, to keep us from ſtarving, and that by pawning or ſelline our children to them for ſervants, till we can redeem them; which we are never like to do, as is expreſſed, verſ. 5. <hi>We bring into bondage our ſonnes and our daughters to be ſervants, and ſome of our daughters are brought unto bondage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, neither is it in our power to redeem them;</hi> ſo that we are in as bad or worſe
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:42229:394"/>
a condition, then when we were bondſlaves in Babylon; and the having of many children, which is of it ſelf a great bleſſing of God, is turned to us as a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter curſe.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>We have morgaged our lands, vineyards, and houſes, that we might buy corn, becauſe of the dearth.]</hi> Even thoſe that had not ſo great a charge of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were forced to morgage their eſtates, becauſe of the dearth that was amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>There were alſo that ſaid, We have borrowed money for the kings tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though we had ſufficient to ſuſtain the charge of our ſelves and families, yet not alſo to defray the tribute that was laid upon us; but even to pay that, we have been conſtrained to morgage our lands and vineyards: for though the Jews had liberty given them to return from Babylon into their own countrey, yet they were to pay tribute there, as is evident, Ezra 4.13. <hi>If this city be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the walls ſet up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and cuſtome, and ſo thou ſhalt endamage the revenue of the king:</hi> and chap. 7.24. <hi>Alſo we certifie you, that touching any of the Prieſts, and Levites, ſingers, porters, Nethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims, or miniſters of this houſe of God, it ſhall not be lawfull to impoſe toll, tribute, or cuſtome upon them.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Yet now our fleſh is as the fleſh of our brethren, our children as their children.]</hi> That is, we are reaſonable creatures, as well as they, not beaſts; yea Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites of the ſeed and linage of Abraham as well as they, not heathens; though they uſe us as if we were not ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And I ſet a great aſſembly againſt them.]</hi> To wit, both of thoſe that were oppreſſed, and thoſe of the better ſort in the congregation, that were not tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this ſinne: yea perhaps he called a generall aſſembly of all the elders of Iſrael, that the ſight of the multitude of thoſe that cryed out againſt them, and the hearing of ſo many of their brethren proteſting againſt this which they had done, and Nehemiahs reproof in this publick aſſembly, all this together might humble them the more, and make them even aſhamed of the evil they had done; which was according to that the Apoſtle adviſeth concerning publick offences, 1. Tim. 5.20. <hi>Them that ſin rebuke before all, that others alſo may fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>We, after our ability, have redeemed our brethren,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, we have done what in us lay to free our brethren from their bondage in Babylon, and will you make them bondſlaves again, onely to pay your uſeries and unjuſt exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? even the bringing of the Jews out of Babylon, may be this redeeming of the Jews, whereof Nehemiah here ſpeaks: yet happely the liberty granted by the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an kings to the Jews, that who would might return to their own countrey, did not extend to thoſe that had been bought and ſold; and therefore perhaps both Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah and others had with their money redeemed many of thoſe that were ſo ſold, and ſo brought them alſo out of Babylon.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>I likewiſe, and my brethren, and my ſervants, might exact of them money and corn.]</hi> To wit, for money we have lent them: or as a recompence of our publick imployments.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, remitting the debt for which they were morgaged; for that he did require them to
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:42229:395"/>
remit the debt, as well as to reſtore the morgage, is evident by their anſwer, verſ. 12. <hi>We will reſtore them, and will require nothing of them.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Alſo the hundred part of the money and of the corn,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, which they paid every moneth by way of uſe for the money, corn, &amp;c. which they had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed; as for inſtance, if they borrowed an hundred pounds, for a moneths loan they paid one pound, and for a twelve-moneth twelve pound; all which ſince they had unjuſtly exacted of their brethren, Nehemiah calls upon them to reſtore it again.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they ſhould do according to this promiſe.]</hi> Some Expoſitours conceive, that ſome of the prieſts being guilty of this ſinne of oppreſſing the people by taking uſury of them, out of reſpect to their office, Nehemiah called them to him by themſelves in private, <hi>and took an oath of them,</hi> that they ſhould alſo do according to that which the people had promiſed; but I rather think, that it was the people of whom he took the oath, of whom it is ſaid in the foregoing words, that they promiſed to do all that Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah had required of them, and that the prieſts were called, either becauſe it was the cuſtome that the prieſts did give the oath to thoſe that were ſworn, or at leaſt, becauſe being ſworn in the preſence of the prieſts, who were the meſſengers of the Lord of hoſts, the adjuration might be the more ſolemn and ſacred, and thoſe that were ſworn, might be the more religiouſly affected with it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Alſo I ſhook my lap, and ſaid, So God ſhake out every man from his houſe, and from his labour,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, may God ſo caſt him out of his houſe, lands, and eſtates, (which is here called his <hi>labour,</hi> becauſe he means that which he had gotten by his labour) that performes not this promiſe, as by ſhaking of my lap, any thing that were therein would be now caſt out of it; ſo that this ceremony of ſhaking his lap, was much like that of Pauls ſhaking his raiment, Acts 18.6. though that was to ſignifie another thing, namely, that he was clear of the bloud of the Jews, that would not embrace the truth he had taught them; <hi>he ſhook his raiment, and ſaid unto them, Your bloud be upon your own heads, I am clean:</hi> and that alſo when Chriſt appointed his diſciples, Matth. 10.14. to ſhake off the duſt from their feet, as a witneſſe againſt thoſe that would not receive them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governour,</hi> &amp;c.] To ſhew, how unreaſonable a thing it was in the richer ſort to take uſury of their poore brethren, he puts them in mind, that merely becauſe he would not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden the people, all the twelve years that he had been their governour, he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wholly upon his own perſonall eſtate, and neither he nor his brethren had eaten the <hi>bread of the governour,</hi> that is, the allowance of bread and other neceſſaries, which had been alwayes given by the people, for the daily proviſion of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and his family: As concerning the twelve years here mentioned, wherein Nehemiah had been their governour, ſee chap. 2.6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>But the former governours that had been before me, were chargeable unto the people,</hi> &amp;c.] To make it the more apparent, how loath he was to be chargeable to the people in regard of their poverty, and ſo by conſequence to imply what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull act it was in the richer ſort to oppreſſe them with uſurie, he ſhewes here, that though he might have challenged a yearely allowance for his maintainance,
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:42229:395"/>
becauſe all the governours had it that were before him, yet he required no ſuch thing of them; <hi>The former governours had taken of them bread and wine,</hi> that is, a certain quality of bread and wine, and ſuch other neceſſaries, <hi>beſides fourty ſhekels of ſilver,</hi> to wit, for every day, or of the head of every family; but he durſt do ſo. But now by the former governours, I do not conceive that Zerubbabel and Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra are meant; but rather thoſe governours, which after Zerubbabels death till Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiahs coming had the chief ſway of government amongſt the Jews, for Ezra was not ſent as a governour, but as a ſcribe to teach them what they ought to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea, even their ſervants bear rule over the people.]</hi> That is, they alſo exacted what they pleaſed of the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16, <hi>Yea, alſo I continued in the work of this wall.]</hi> Though in the third chapter, where it is fully expreſſed by whom the ſeverall parts of the wall were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, there is no mention of any particular part thereof undertaken by Nehemiah; yet he might well ſay, that he <hi>continued in the work of the wall,</hi> becauſe he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually imployed in the overſight of the work, and was ſtill with them, to direct and incourage the builders; yea, and becauſe his ſervants were imployed too where moſt need was, to help in the work, as it followes in this verſe, <hi>and all my ſervants were gathered thither unto the work:</hi> though he lived wholly upon his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate means, yet both he and his were ſtill imployed in the publick ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither bought we any land.]</hi> Though the people being many of them much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, he might have had great bargains of them: and this is alledged as a proof, that neither he nor his ſought to advance themſelves; but onely ſought the good of the people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Moreover, there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers,</hi> &amp;c.] The charge he was at in entertaining ſo many of the rulers, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtrangers daily at his table, is here alledged, (to wit, during the time of his being in Jeruſalem: for it is likely that he was often away in Perſia, and this charge conſtantly for twelve years together, would otherwiſe have ſpent a kings eſtate,) firſt, becauſe hereby the people were much eaſed; for a heavie burden it would have been to them, if all this had been done at the common charge: and ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this circumſtance did much commend his not taking from the people that which the former governours had taken of them for their maintenance, to wit, that he was put to ſo great charge, and yet he defrayed it all of his own private means.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Alſo fowl were prepared for me, and once in ten dayes ſtore of all ſorts of wine.]</hi> That is, beſides the ordinary proviſion prepared for every day, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tenth day I feaſted them more liberally, and gave them ſtore of all ſorts of wine.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>SAnballat, and Geſhem ſent unto me, ſaying, Come, let us meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſome one of the villages, in the plain of Ono,</hi> &amp;c.] Which was in the tribe of Benjamin, chap. 11.30, 35. 1. Chron. 8.12. It is likely therefore that Sanballat appointed this place for their meeting, ſo near to Jeruſalem, that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah might be the more eaſily induced to come thither; but, ſaith Nehemiah,
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:42229:396"/>
                     <hi>they thought to do me miſchief;</hi> that is, to ſlay me, or at leaſt, to make me their priſoner.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Then ſent Sanballat his ſervants unto me, in like manner, the fifth time, with an open letter.]</hi> He ſent the letter open, either to imply that what was written in that letter was no ſecret thing, but what was common in every mans mouth; or elſe that the meſſenger might ſhew it to others of the Jews before he came to Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, and ſo with the contents thereof might diſcourage them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>It is reported among the heathen, and Gaſhmu ſaith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebell.]</hi> That is, that you may not think I pretend a rumour, when there is no ſuch thing; I will name you one in particular who will confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre it, and that is Gaſhmu, or Geſhem, verſ. 2. the king of Perſia his deputy Lieutenant in Arabia; and that becauſe hereby alſo you may ſee how farre the rumour is ſpread, and that their be ſome no mean men that will maintain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou buildeſt the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to theſe words.]</hi> According to this report which is abroad of you.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And thou haſt alſo appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jeruſalem, ſaying, There is a king in Judah.]</hi> That is. we have now a king again of our own nation, and ſhall not be in bondage any longer to forrein princes. I find ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours of opinion, that ſuch a rumour was indeed ſpread abroad concerning Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, and that it was raiſed by occaſion of the propheſies of Haggai and Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah, concerning the near approach of Chriſts kingdome; which were by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as if they had been ſpoken of Nehemiah. But I think it may as well be ſuppoſed that there were no ſuch rumours; but that they were merely forged by San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat to ſcare Nehemiah, and in hope he would thereupon come to them to clear himſelf: for ſo Nehemiah anſwers, verſ. 8. <hi>There are no ſuch things done as thou ſayeſt, but thou faigneſt them out of thy own heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Come now therefore, and let us take counſell together.]</hi> That is, let us meet and adviſe in a friendly manner, that we may ſee whether this report be true, and if it be falſe, what courſe is to be taken to diſcover your innocency, and to prevent the king of Perſiaes diſpleaſure againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Afterward I came unto the houſe of Shemaiah the ſonne of Delai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who was ſhut up.]</hi> It ſeems this Shemaiah was a prieſt of the courſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laiah, 1. Chron. 24.18. and therefore called here <hi>the ſonne of Delaiah,</hi> and that accordingly he had his houſe in the Temple: but withall it is evident, that he was accounted a prophet, though he was indeed a falſe prophet, and was hired at this time by Tobiah and Sanballat, to prophecy of the danger that was coming upon Nehemiah, purpoſely that he might be terrified and be wonne to hide himſelfe, and ſo the hearts of all the people might be diſcouraged likewiſe, and ſome advantage by this means might be taken againſt them: why it is here ſaid he was at this time <hi>ſhut up,</hi> the judgement of Expoſitours is divers: the moſt probable reaſons that I find given for it, are, that he ſhut up himſelf, either firſt, to make a ſhew of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to retire himſelf that he might pray with the greater liberty, and receive ſome revelation from God: or ſecondly, out of a pretence of fearing ſome ſudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that would be made upon the city, which cauſed him to ſhut up himſelf, that he might keep out the enemy: or thirdly, that he did it as a propheticall ſigne that
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:42229:396"/>
ſuch dangers were coming upon the city that men ſhould be glad to ſhut up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, aſſaying thereby to hide themſelves from the enemy: whereof when Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah heard, for this very cauſe it was that he came to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid, Let us meet together in the houſe of God, within the Temple, and let us ſhut the doores,</hi> &amp;c.] And thus under a pretence of perſwading Nehemiah to ſhut up himſelf in the Temple that his enemies might not come at him, he ſought by Nehemiahs cowardiſe to diſcourage all the people, as is before noted, and withall might have a purpoſe to deliver him up into their hands, having him thus faſt ſhut up, that he could not eſcape to hide himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And I ſaid, Should ſuch a man as I flee?</hi> &amp;c.] Being called of God to do what I do, and being at preſent the chief magiſtrate and governour of this city, who am therefore to take care for the defence of the people, and to give them all poſſible encouragement both by word and deed, Should I flee, and that into the Temple, like a malefactour that ſought to take ſanctuary there? Surely this were the ready way utterly to diſcourage the people, and to bring a reproch both upon my ſelf and upon them, as if I did diſtruſt the providence and protection of God; and therefore were it to ſave my life, I would not do it. This I conceive was the full meaning of theſe words of Nehemiah; yet ſome think alſo that he refuſed to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, becauſe it was not lawfull for any but the prieſts to go in thither, Numb. 3.38.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And lo, I perceived that God had not ſent him,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, both by the advice he gave, becauſe it tended to the hurt of Gods people, and to beat him off by terrifying him from the work, which God had given him in charge; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe afterwards by the event, becauſe the enemies came not that night to ſeize upon him, as Shemaiah had prophecyed they would.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>So the wall was finiſhed, in the twenty and fifth day of the moneth Elul,</hi> &amp;c.] The very doores of the gates being then alſo ſet up; which was not done before verſ. 1. The whole work was finiſhed on the twenty fifth day of the moneth Elul (which was their ſixth moneth, agreeing moſt what with our Auguſt, and ſhewes that they undertook the work in the heighth of ſummer, when the dayes were at the longeſt, and the ſeaſon every way moſt ſeaſonable for building) and ſo all was diſpatched in <hi>fifty and two dayes,</hi> to wit, from the time that they firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the repairing of the wall. Indeed, becauſe it ſeems impoſſible that ſo great a work ſhould be finiſhed in ſo ſhort a compaſſe, to wit, fifty two dayes, which was not full two moneths, therefore ſome Expoſitours underſtand theſe <hi>fifty two dayes</hi> to be meant of the time after the ſtone wall was finiſhed, and that meſſage was ſent from Sanballat and Tobiah, whereof mention is made verſ. 2. but becauſe no ſuch thing is here expreſſed, I rather underſtand it of the time wherein the whole work was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And indeed if we conſider, firſt, that the walls and towers were not wholly razed to the ground, but onely battered and broken, and had many breaches in them: ſecondly, that there was a multitude of people who round about the city in ſeverall places at one time were employed in the work, and did with much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe follow it: and thirdly, that it was indeed finiſhed to the aſtoniſhment of the enemies, verſ. 16. before they dreamed it could have been done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>And it came to paſſe, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that was about
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:42229:397"/>
us ſaw theſe things, they were much caſt down in their own eyes, for they perceived this work was wrought of our God:</hi> I ſay, conſidering all theſe things, it needs not ſeem ſo incredible that the work was begun and perfected <hi>in fifty two dayes.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>WHen the wall was built, and I had ſet up the doores; and the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the ſingers, and the Levites were appointed]</hi> By the Levites, thus diſtinguiſhed from the porters and ſingers, are meant ſuch of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, as were to attend upon the prieſts in their office: and the meaning of this clauſe is, either that Nehemiah did chooſe out and appoint ſome of theſe to perform ſome ſolemn ſervice at the dedication of the walls by way of thankſgiving to God; or elſe that ſuch of the porters, ſingers, and Levites, as had been ſome way imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the building, were now appointed again to return to their ſervice in the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jeruſalem.]</hi> To his brother or kinſman Hanani (who firſt brought him word of the ſad eſtate of Jeruſalem, chap. 1.1, 2.) and to Hananiah the ruler of the palace, he gave charge over Jeruſalem; that is, to ſee that the gates were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhut and opened in due time, and a ſufficient watch for the better guard of the city alwayes maintained.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And while they ſtand by, let them ſhut the doores, and barre them.]</hi> That is, let not thoſe that have the charge of ſhutting and barring the gates, appoint or ſend others to do it for them; but let them at leaſt ſtand by themſelves and ſee it done as it ſhould be. Some indeed conceive that this is ſpoken of Hanani and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naniah, to wit, that they were to ſee the gates ſhut up themſelves: but the words ſeem more clearly to import, that it is ſpoken of them that by Hanani and Hanani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah ſhould be appointed to this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his houſe.]</hi> That is, every one to watch in that part which was neareſt to his own dwelling; thoſe that dwelt in the weſt parts of the city were not to be called to watch on the walls on the eaſt-ſide, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 4. <hi>Now the city was large and great, but the people were few therein and the houſes were not builded.]</hi> So that there was no proportion betwixt the walls without, and the houſes of the city within; nor were the inhabitants ſufficient for the defence of the walls in ſo large a circuit: which is alledged here as the reaſon why Nehemiah undertook the numbring of the people, according to their genealogies, as is related in the following verſe. Some indeed of the chief of the inhabitants were carefull to build themſelves ſtately and fair houſes, Haggai 1.4 <hi>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houſes</hi> &amp;c. but the whileſt it ſeems the moſt of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes lay ruinated and unbuilt: and though there came out of Babylon with Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel fourty two thouſand three hundred and ſixty, Ezra 2 64. yet the greateſt number of theſe happely choſe to ſeat themſelves in ſome other part of the countrey, rather then in Jeruſalem: either becauſe of the miſery that had befallen the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this city formerly, when it was taken by the Chaldees; or becauſe they found the city unfit to dwell in.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And my God put into mine heart, to gather together the nobles and
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:42229:397"/>
the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogies.]</hi> To wit, that knowing the number of the people according to their ſeverall genealogies, firſt, thoſe families that belonged to Jeruſalem might be appointed to dwell there: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that as need was found, others might be alſo called in to inhabit Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, though their progenitours had not dwelt there: thirdly, that according as men were found able they might be appointed to lend aid to the rebuilding of thoſe houſes in Jeruſalem that lay in the rubbiſh. This aſſembly was gathered <hi>upon the first day of the ſeventh moneth,</hi> chap. 8.2. when they were firſt prepared by the hearing of the law, that they might the more willingly undertake what was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the common good; and then order was taken for theſe things, chap. 11.1. <hi>The reſt of the people cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in Jeruſalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I found a regiſter of the genealogie of them which came up at the firſt,</hi> &amp;c.] For their better proceeding a preſident was ſought of their former numbring the people in the dayes of Zerubbabel, and this regiſter was found that follows in the next verſe, which in many things differs from that Ezra 2.1. and therefore it is thought that that in Ezra was taken and written when they were preparing to come out of Babylon; this, when they were come into Judea.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Theſe are the children of the province,</hi> &amp;c.] What is to be noted for the underſtanding of this regiſter of the genealogie of them that returned out of Babylon, we may ſee in the notes upon the ſecond chapter of Ezra.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 70. <hi>And ſome of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work.]</hi> Some conceive that this is ſtill a continuation of the regiſter that was found, mentioned above verſ. 5. containing a catalogue of what was given at their firſt return out of Babylon towards the building of the Temple, &amp;c. And whereas it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that there is a great deal of difference betwixt that which is ſaid to be given there, Ezra 2.69. and that which here is ſaid was given; to this they anſwer, that all that was given by the encouragement of Cyrus, both by Jews and Perſians, is there ſet down; here, onely that which was given by the Jews. But I rather conceive with other Expoſitours, that the regiſter that was found, mentioned verſ. 5. ended with the former verſe, and that here now is added what was collected after the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were numbred by Nehemiah, according to the preſident of the regiſter that was found: for as there was a collection of money and other things made, when they were numbred according to their genealogies in Zerubbabels time, at their firſt coming out of Babylon, Ezra 2.68. ſo was it now alſo, onely that was merely for the building of the Temple, this was partly for the ſervice of the Temple (for why elſe were ſo many prieſts garments given, mentioned in the following words) but in part alſo for the rebuilding of the city. See above, verſ. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Tirſhatha gave to the treaſure.]</hi> That is, Nehemiah, chap. 10.1. and 8.9. <hi>Now thoſe that ſealed were Nehemiah the Tirſhatha,</hi> &amp;c. See the note alſo Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra 2.63.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd all the people gathered themſelves together as one man,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, <hi>on the firſt day of the ſeventh moneth,</hi> verſ. 2. which was the feaſt of trumpets, Levit. 23.24. and not many dayes after the wall was finiſhed, which was on the twentie fifth day of the ſixth moneth, chap. 6.15. Some Expoſitours conceive that this is but onely a more full and large relation of thoſe things which were done long ſince at Zerubbabels firſt coming into Judea, and which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more breifly related by Ezra, Ezra 3.1. &amp;c. and that, firſt, becauſe as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of Ezra ends, and the third begins, ſo with the ſame words in effect doth the ſeventh chapter of Nehemiah end and the eighth begin: and ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not likely that Ezra, being ſent to inſtruct the people in the Law of God, would ſuffer them ſo long, to wit, till Nehemiahs coming, to be ignorant of the main duties of Gods worſhip and ſervice, as it ſeems now they were, verſ. 14. <hi>And they found written in the Law which the Lord had commanded by Moſes, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſhould dwell in booths in the feast of the ſeventh moneth,</hi> &amp;c. But theſe reaſons are too weak to winne us to admit of ſuch a confuſion in the order of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: rather therefore I conceive, that what is here related was done in Nehemiahs time, after the wall was finiſhed, as is above related. The place where they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether was, as is here added, <hi>the ſtreet that was before the water-gate;</hi> a gate mentioned before, chap. 3.26. and in the ſtreet hereof it ſeems the people were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, becauſe the court of the Temple could not contain ſuch a multitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they ſpake unto Ezra the ſcribe to bring the book of the Law of Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note Ezra 7.1. and 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And beſide him ſtood Mattithiah,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as witneſſes ready to approve and maintain the truth of that which from the Law of God ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, and in their turn alſo to perform the work.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Alſo Joſhua, and Bani,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, not onely Ezra did thus expound the Law unto the people, but others alſo of the prieſts and Levites <hi>cauſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to underſtand the Law,</hi> becauſe they could not all conveniently heare Ezra, they were divided into ſeverall companies, and in each of them there were pulpits or ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds erected, as may be gathered, chap 9.4, from whence they read and expounded the Law unto them, there being ſeverall teachers in each place that might ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharge that work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the people ſtood in their place.]</hi> To wit, ſome in one company, and ſome in another, according to their diviſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So they read in the book, in the Law of God diſtinctly, and gave the ſenſe, and cauſed them to underſtand the reading.]</hi> It is a weak conceit of ſome popiſh Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours, that they did reade onely that in the Syriak tongue to the people, which in the originall book was written in Hebrew, and that becauſe the people, ſince their return out of Babylon, did neither ſpeak, nor perfectly underſtand the Hebrew tongue, but the Syriak onely; for the words do plainly import that they expounded that which they read to them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And Nehemiah which is the Tirſhatha.]</hi> See Ezra 2.63.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This day is holy unto the Lord your God, mourn not nor weep.]</hi> That is, this day
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:42229:398"/>
the Lord hath appointed to be conſecrated to him, as a holy day of ſpirituall rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and feaſting together, Numb. 10.10. <hi>In the day of your gladneſſe, and in your ſolemne dayes, and in the beginnings of your moneths ye ſhall blow the trumpet,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore be comforted and chear up your hearts with the aſſurance of Gods mercy, and make not your ſelves unfit for the ſervice of this day by your exceſſive and unſeaſonable mourning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law.]</hi> Becauſe they they perceived by that they had heard from their teachers, how many wayes they had broken the Law of their God, and had by that means provoked the Lord to poure forth thoſe judgements upon them, which they ſaw he had long ſince threatned againſt thoſe which did not obey his commandments.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Then he ſaid unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the ſweet,</hi> &amp;c.] This is meant of their feaſting together with their peace-offerings, to which he addes, <hi>and ſend portions unto them, for whom nothing is prepared,</hi> that is, to the poore, the fatherleſſe, and widows; which was according to the Law, Deut. 16.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt rejoyce in thy feaſt, thou, and thy ſonne, and thy daughter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, the ſtranger, the fatherleſſe, and the widow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.]</hi> That is, your rejoycing in the Lord his love and favour and manifold mercies, which he hath of late conferred upon you, and doth ſtill continue to you, is that whereby you muſt be ſtrengthened both in the outward and inward man.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And on the ſecend day were gathered together the chief,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>even to underſtand the words of the Law.]</hi> That is, to adviſe with him concerning ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular paſſages, which happely they had obſerved the day before in the expounding of the Law; amongſt which I conceive one main thing was, concerning the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the feaſt of Tabernacles, whereof happely Ezra the day before had purpoſely ſpoken to inſtruct the people, becauſe that feaſt was now nigh at hand; for ſo much ſeems to be implyed, verſ. 14. <hi>And the found written in the Law which the Lord had commanded by Moſes, that the children of Iſrael ſhould dwell in booths in the feaſt of the ſeventh moneth.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>For ſince the dayes of Joſhua the ſonne of Nun, unto that day, had not the children of Iſrael done ſo.]</hi> That is, from Joſhuas time till then they had not kept this feaſt in ſuch a ſolemne manner, with ſuch celebration and devotion, as it was kept now. Joſhuas time is mentioned, not the time of Moſes, becauſe happely till Joſhua brought them into the land of Canaan they kept not this feaſt: it was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of their dwelling in booths, as they paſſed through the wilderneſſe out of Egypt. See Levit. 23.42, 43. and therefore till they were come into Canaan, and had left dwelling in tabernacles and booths, there needed no memoriall of it: but now that this feaſt ſo expreſſely commanded by God ſhould be utterly diſuſed and neglected from Joſhua till then, a matter of a thouſand years, in the times of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny godly princes and prieſts, is methinks altogether improbable; beſides, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:42229:399"/>
that in Zerubbabels time at the peoples firſt coming out of Babylon, which was long before this, they kept this feaſt, Ezra 3.4. <hi>They kept alſo the feaſt of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore the meaning of theſe words muſt needs be this onely; that from the dayes of Joſhua till then they had not kept this feaſt <hi>ſo,</hi> that is, with ſuch devotion and ſolemnitie. Wherein the difference was it is hard to ſay, yet one particular ſeems to be that which is expreſſed in the following verſe; namely, that all the ſeven dayes, day after day, the prople met together and had the Law read and expounded to them; whereas formerly, becauſe the firſt and laſt dayes were onely appointed to be more ſolemne convocations and great holy dayes, whereon they might do no work, Levit. 23.35, 36. their manner it ſeems had been to aſſemble the people, and reade the word onely on the firſt and laſt dayes, which was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and the word was reade all the ſeven dayes, though the firſt and laſt were kept more ſolemnely, as the great holy dayes of the feaſt, as one of them is called, John 7.37. <hi>The last and great day of the feaſt:</hi> ſo much ſeems implyed, verſ. 18. <hi>Alſo day by day, from the firſt day unto the laſt day, he read in the book of the Law of God: and they kept the feaſt ſeven dayes,</hi> &amp;c. and to this ſome adde alſo, that they had never before built themſelves booths upon the tops of their homes, as now they had done, as is expreſſely noted before, verſ. 16.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.]</hi> This Joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada, Jonathan, and Jaddua, were doubtloſſe high prieſts in the times of thoſe kings of Perſia that ſucceeded Artaxerxes Longimanus (whoſe cup-bearer Nehemiah was,) to wit, Darius Nothus, Artaxerxes Mnemon, Artaxerxes Ochus, Arſes, and Darius the laſt called Codomanus, who loſt the Empire to Alexander the great; for as Joſephus reports, this Jaddua it was that met Alexander the great in his pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall robes, when he came againſt Jeruſalem; with the glory of whoſe preſence that great conquerour was ſo ſtricken, that he granted the Jews all, and more than they deſired. Nor needs it ſeem ſtrange that Nehemiah ſhould live to ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſucceſſions of high prieſts; for happely he was very young when he was Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes cup-bearer: and ſecondly, happely Jaddua (who lived in Alexanders time) was not yet high prieſt when Nehemiah wrote this, but was onely added to the reſt, becauſe he was to ſucceed his father Jonathan: and thirdly, God doth uſually grant long life to thoſe whom he raiſeth up to be great inſtruments of good to his Church. But however it may well be which others ſay, that this clauſe was inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after Nehemiahs death by ſome other holy man of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And in the dayes of Joiakim, were priests, the chief of the fathers of Seraiah, Meraiah,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Meraiah was the head or chief of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the dayes of Jehoiakim, of which Seraiah was head or chief, verſ. 1. in the dayes of Jeſhua: and ſo we muſt underſtand all the reſt that are named in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond catalogue.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Of Miniamim, of Moadiah, Piltai.]</hi> The meaning of this clauſe is, either that Piltai was the head of both theſe families; or elſe that he was the head of the family of Miniamin, who was deſcended of Moadiah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>The Levites in the dayes of Eliaſhib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua, were recorded,</hi> &amp;c.] Having ſet down in the ten foregoing verſes, who were the chief prieſts in the dayes of Joiakim the ſonne of Jeſhua; here we are told that both the chief Levites and prieſts in the dayes of the following high prieſts, to wit, <hi>Eliaſhib, Joiada, and Johanan,</hi> (the ſame that is before called Jonathan, verſ. 11.) and <hi>Jaddua</hi> even <hi>to the reigne of Darius the Perſian,</hi> that is, Darius Codomanus the laſt Perſian king, who was vanquiſhed by Alexander the great <hi>were recorded;</hi> which is as if it had been ſaid, being recorded elſewhere, there is no need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating them here again. Now becauſe Jaddua is here again mentioned, it is thought by ſome, that this verſe was alſo inſerted after the death of Nehemiah.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>The ſonnes of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the Chronicles,</hi> &amp;c.] Here we are told where the names of the chief Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites before mentioned are recorded, untill <hi>the dayes of Johanan,</hi> or Jonathan <hi>the ſonne,</hi> that is, the grandchild of <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> verſ. 11. (and becauſe many of them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alſo in the dayes of Jaddua, in the foregoing verſe he alſo is mentioned) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>in the book of the Chronicles,</hi> which whether it be meant of the Scripture Chronicles or no, it is hard to ſay.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the chief of the Levites,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in the dayes of Joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akim;

for ſo it is expreſſed, verſ. 26. <hi>Theſe were in the dayes of Joiakim the ſonne of Jeſhua,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>And at the dedication of the wall of Jeruſalem, they ſought the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> &amp;c.] For as at their firſt taking poſſeſſion of any new built houſe, they uſed to dedicate it with feaſting, prayer, and praiſing God (as it is noted, Deut. 20.1.) whence is that title of Pſalme 30. <hi>A Pſalme and ſong at the dedication of Davids houſe,</hi> ſo now they reſolved to keep a ſolemn feſtivity for the dedication of the walls of Jeruſalem; to wit, with praying to God that he would bleſſe them and make them a means of ſafety to his holy city, and with praiſing God with Pſalmes of joy and thankſgiving, the rather becauſe the walls were ſo miraculouſly finiſhed in ſo ſhort a time, maugre all the oppoſition of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.]</hi> To wit, by ſprinkling upon them the water of purifying, as alſo by praying and praiſing God, as in the former note.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Viz.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Levites and many of the people, as is expreſſed, verſ. 38. and then being altogether in one place, Nehemiah <hi>appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks,</hi> that is, he divided them into two companies; in the one company was Ezra, who went formoſt, verſ. 36. with whom went thoſe Levites and prieſts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, verſ. 32. &amp;c. to the end of the 36. verſe, <hi>with half of the princes,</hi> verſ. 32. yea, <hi>and half of the people,</hi> verſ. 38. in the other company was Nehemiah, verſ. 38. and the other half both of the princes and people, verſ. 38, 40. and likewiſe thoſe prieſts and Levites mentioned, verſ. 41.42. And then being thus divided, Ezra and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany turned on the right hand toward the dung-gate; Nehemiah and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the left, toward the tower of the furnaces, verſ. 38. and ſo met both at laſt in the Temple, verſ. 40. which was in the weſt of the citie; whence it ſeems they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan on the eaſt-ſide, Concerning the ſeverall gates here mentioned, ſee the ſeverall notes on the ſecond and third chapters of this book.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ON that day they read in the book of Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.] This I conceive, hath not reference to that which is immediately before related, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dedication of the walls of Jeruſalem, (for the walls were begun to be built within a while after Nehemiahs firſt coming to Jeruſalem, and were finiſhed within two moneths or leſſe, chap. 6.15. nor is it likely, that it was long after ere the walls were dedicated) but rather to the day whereon they ſealed the covenant, (whereof he had ſpoken before in the ninth and tenth chapters) when upon reading of the law amongſt other evils, this alſo concerning their marriages with heathens, and the joyning of their children to the congregation of the Lord, was diſcovered and reformed, by ſeparating all the mixed multitude from the children of Iſrael, as
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:42229:403"/>
is noted before, chap. 9.2. and here repeated again, verſ. 3. and this, (as it ſeems by that which follows, verſ. 4, 5, 6.) was about the two and thirtieth yeare of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes, ſome twelve years after Nehemiahs firſt coming to Jeruſalem, when having been with Artaxerxes in Perſia, he returned again to Jeruſalem, and reformed ſuch abuſes as in the time of his abſence were crept in amongſt them, ſee the note, chap. 2.1. and chap. 5.14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And therein was written that the Ammonite and Moabite ſhould not come into the congregation,</hi> &amp;c.] No nor their children unto the tenth generation, Deut. 23.1.3. concerning which ſee the notes there. And though there were many paſſages in Moſes law, that were againſt the polluting of the ſeed of Iſrael by mariages with the nations about them, yet this is here alledged concerning the Ammonites and Moabites, rather then any other; becauſe it did ſo expreſſely diſcover the great ſinne of Eliaſhib, mentioned afterwards, verſ. 4.5. in joyning himſelf in affinity with Tobiah, who is often called <hi>the ſervant the Ammonite:</hi> yea, and honouring him ſo farre, as to allot him a chamber in the very Temple.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>They ſeparated from Iſrael all the mixed multitude.]</hi> This is added to aggravate the ſinne of Eliaſhib the high prieſt, related in the following verſes, who was ſo farre from a ſincere deſire to reform this abuſe diſcovered by the law, that notwithſtanding the people did unanimouſly ſeparate all the mixed multitude from the children of Iſrael, yet he immediately after Nehemiah was gone into Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, (which was (verſ. 6.) <hi>in the thirty ſecond yeare of Artaxerxes</hi> reigne) received Tobiah amongſt them, yea, and gave him a lodging in the very Temple; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he had happely diſſembled theſe his purpoſes ſo long as Nehemiah abode in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And before this, Eliaſhib the prieſt having the overſight of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the houſe of our God, was allied unto Tobiah.]</hi> That is, before this reading of the law, and the reformation thereupon following, mentioned in the former verſes.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where afore time they laid the meat-offerings,</hi> &amp;c,] To wit, not when he was firſt allyed to Tobiah, but long after when Nehemiah was gone into Perſia, verſ. 6. However he carried the matter when (Nehemiah being then preſent) upon the reading of the law, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeparated from Iſrael all the mixed multitude, verſ. 3. yet ſo ſoon as Nehemiah was gone into Perſia, in the thirty ſecond yeare of Artaxerxes reigne, Eliaſhib diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf; preparing, that is, making ready and furniſhing for his friend and ally Tobiah the Ammonite a great chamber, even in the chambers of the Temple: which was done it ſeems, by laying many chambers into one, the partitions being taken down, as may be gathered from verſ. 9. where it is ſaid that Nehemiah having caſt out Tobiahs houſhold-ſtuffe, cauſed the chambers to be cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>For in the two and thirtieth yeare of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king,</hi> &amp;c.] Twelve years after his firſt coming to Jeruſalem, <hi>which was in the twentieth yeare of Artaxerxes,</hi> chap. 2.1.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then I commanded, and they cleanſed the chambers.]</hi> To wit, by caſting out the houſhold-ſtuffe of Tobiah; and happely, by ſprinkling them with the water of purifying, becauſe they had been polluted and profaned by the
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:42229:403"/>
lodging of ſtrangers therein, that were not of the ſeed of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And I perceived that the portion of the Levites had not been given them.]</hi> The people had not long ſince by covenant with God bound themſelves to the contrary, chap. 10.35. &amp;c. but it ſeems out of indignation againſt Eliaſhib, for lodging Tobiah in the treaſuries of the Temple, and becauſe they feared thereupon, that what they brought thither was diverted ſome other way, and not imployed as it ought to be, they wholly forbare to bring in the Levites portions as they had formerly done.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Then contended I with the rulers, and ſaid, Why is the houſe of God forſaken?]</hi> They had ſaid before when they made that ſolemn covenant with God, <hi>We will not forſake the houſe of our God,</hi> chap. 10.39. and now therefore Nehemiah upbraids them as it were with their own words, and condemnes them out of their own mouthes, <hi>Why is the houſe of God forſaken?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds,</hi> &amp;c.] He brags not, but prayes; not claiming any thing of merit as due in juſtice, but producing the good which through the grace of God he had done, he beggs of God to remember him in goodneſſe and mercy, to accept of theſe his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to ſerve him according to the ſincerity of his heart, and not to reject them becauſe of his many failings, as is more fully expreſſed, verſ. 22. <hi>Remember me, O my God, concerning this alſo, and ſpare me according to the greatneſſe of thy mercy,</hi> yea, herein alſo he intimates, that he knew well enough, that perhaps from men he ſhould have no thanks, but he ſought not the praiſe of men; if it proved ſo, he beſeeched the Lord however to remember him, and then he had his deſire.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>In thoſe dayes, ſaw I in Judah, ſome treading winepreſſes on the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> &amp;c.] Which was alſo contrary to their former promiſe, when they ſolemnly renewed their covenant with God, chap. 10.31.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>There dwelt men of Tyre alſo therein, which brought fiſh, and all manner of ware, and ſold on the ſabbath,</hi> &amp;c.] Keeping their very markets upon the ſabbath dayes; and this they did too (which is added in the laſt words as a great aggravation of their ſinnes) <hi>in Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, even in the city Jeruſalem, which God had choſen to himſelf for his habitation.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>When the gates of Jeruſalem began to be dark,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when the ſunne was well nigh ſet: for then the mountains in Jeruſalem intercepting the light of the ſetting ſunne, the gates of Jeruſalem began to be ſhadowed and dark, and thus timely <hi>he commanded that the gates ſhould be ſhut,</hi> that he might be ſure the whole ſabbath ſhould be kept holy; which began there at the ſunne ſetting, and laſted till the ſunne ſetting of the following day, Levit. 23.32. <hi>From even unto even ſhall ye celebrate your ſabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſome of my ſervants ſet I at the gates, that there ſhould be no burden brought in on the ſabbath day.]</hi> Though he had charged that the gates ſhould not be opened, (that is, ſet wide open, that all might have free egreſſe and regreſſe as on other dayes) <hi>till after the ſabbath,</hi> as is expreſſed in the foregoing words: yet there was a neceſſity of opening the doores to let in and out thoſe that had any neceſſary occaſion, eſpecially ſuch as dwelt in the ſuburbs, and were to come in to ſerve God in the Temple; therefore he ſet ſome of his ſervants to be at the gates, to ſee
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:42229:404"/>
that under that pretence none were admitted that would bring in any burden.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Then I teſtified againſt them, and ſaid unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, firſt becauſe thoſe that dwelt without the walls might ſtill buy of them on the ſabbath day: ſecondly, becauſe their being there with wares ready to ſell, might be a dangerous temptation to move thoſe within the walls to try by ſome meanes to get out to them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And I commanded the Levites that they ſhould cleanſe themſelves, and that they ſhould come and keep the gates, to ſanctifie the ſabbath day.]</hi> Some underſtand this alſo of the city gates, to wit, that the Levites as men of greateſt fidelity, ſhould ſee that the gates were duly kept ſhut. But becauſe his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were appointed to that ſervice, and becauſe it is ſaid, that the <hi>Levites ſhould cleanſe themſelves,</hi> that they might be fit to keep theſe gates, I conceive this is meant of the gates of the Temple, through which they were to take care that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon did enter, in that great concourſe of people that reſorted thither on the ſabbath day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember, me O my God, concerning this alſo, and ſpare me,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe by his ſtricktneſſe in reforming theſe profanations of the ſabbath, he knew that many were highly diſpleaſed with him, he deſires the Lord would accept of his ſervice, and then it was no great matter what men thought of him; but withall, becauſe he knew, that his beſt actions would not indure the exact tryall of Gods juſtice, therefore even herein he implores Gods mercy, <hi>and ſpare me according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>And their children ſpake half in the ſpeech of Aſhdod,</hi> &amp;c.] So likewiſe thoſe of other nations; which beſides that it was in it ſelf diſhonourable to the people of God, it was alſo a dangerous ſigne that they had a mixture of the manners, as well as of the language of their heathen mothers.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>And I contended with them, and curſed them,</hi> &amp;c.] Firſt, he curſeth, that is, he pronounced them accurſed, and accordingly excommunicated them, and caſt them out of the congregation of the Lord: ſecondly, <hi>He ſmote certain of them;</hi> that is, thoſe whom he found moſt obſtinate, he cauſed to be beaten accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that law, Deut. 25.2. <hi>If the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, the judge ſhall cauſe him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number:</hi> and indeed we read that Paul was ſo puniſhed by the Jews, 2. Cor. 11.25. <hi>Thrice was I beaten with rods,</hi> &amp;c. yea, and happely alſo to be ſmitten with the fiſt; for ſo it ſeems the cuſtome was among the Jews to uſe thoſe that were condemned for any great offence, Iſaiah 54.4. <hi>Ye fast for ſtrife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and to ſmite with the fist of wickedneſſe,</hi> Matth. 26.67. <hi>They ſpit in his face, and buffetted him, and others ſmote him with the palmes of their hands,</hi> John 18.22. <hi>One of the officers that ſtood by ſtruck Jeſus with the palme of his hand,</hi> Acts 23.2. <hi>And the high prieſt commanded them that ſtood by to ſmite him on the mouth:</hi> and thirdly, <hi>he plucked off their hair:</hi> for it ſeemes that amongſt the Jews, thoſe that were found guilty of any foul offence, were delivered up to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches either of the people in generall, or of thoſe that were to puniſh them; who were accordingly wont not onely to buffet them, but alſo to pluck off their hair, Iſaiah 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that pulled
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:42229:404"/>
off the haire;</hi> and ſo were theſe men now uſed by Nehemiahs appointment.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>And one of the ſonnes of Joiada, the ſonne of Eliaſhib the high prieſt, was ſonne in law to Sanballat.]</hi> That is, one of the grand children of Joiada: for this was (according to Joſephus) one Manaſſes the brother of Jaddua the high prieſt, who was the ſonne of Jonathan, and the grandchild of Joiada the ſonne of Eliaſhib: He having married the daughter of Sanballat, that he might not turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wife (which either he muſt do or be turned out of the prieſthood) his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law Sanballat undertook to build a Temple, every way as ſtately and goodly as that at Jeruſalem, wherein Manaſſes ſhould be the chief prieſt; which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly (having firſt obtained leave of Alexander) he did perform, and built this new Temple, that it might have the greater honour, in mount Gerizim, hard by the city Sichem: and from this beginning came that famous ſchiſme, as touching the place where ſacrifices were to be offered, betwixt the Samaritanes and Jews, John 4.20. <hi>Our fathers worſhiped in this mount, and ye ſay that in Jeruſalem is the place where men ought to worſhip;</hi> but whether therefore this was that Sanballat that is ſo often mentioned in this book, or another of his poſterity of the ſame name, it is hard to ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore I chaſed him from me.]</hi> Becauſe he would not put away his wife, I cauſed him to be excommunicated, and baniſhed from amongſt us: and ſo he went and became the chief prieſt in the Samaritanes temple, as is above mentioned in the former note.</p>

As for this Ahaſuerus in whoſe reigne theſe things were done, doubtleſſe it was not that Ahaſuerus mentioned Dan. 9.10. to wit, Aſtyages the father of Darius the Mede, who with Cyrus firſt ſubdued the Babylonian Monarchy: for the Empire was not in his dayes grown up to ſuch a flouriſhing ſtate; and purpoſely no doubt to diſtinguiſh this Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus from former Perſian kings of that name, the largeneſſe of his Empire is expreſſed in the following words, <hi>This is Ahaſuerus which reigned from India,</hi> &amp;c. Nor was it Cambyſes the ſonne of Cyrus (who yet according to the judgement of moſt Expoſitours is called Ahaſuerus, and Artaxerxes, Ezra 4.6, 7. of which ſee the note there) for he all his dayes was a bitter enemy to the Jews, and hindred the building of the Temple, and therefore ſurely was not the husband of Eſther. And again, no Author holds that he reigned above eight or nine years, whereas the twelfth yeare of the reigne of this Ahaſuerus is expreſſely mentioned, chap. 3.7. The moſt probable opinion therefore is, that either it was Darius the ſonne of Hyſtaſpes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by other Hiſtorians it is ſaid, that his wife was called Atoſſa, which ſounds in part ſome what like Hadaſſah chap. 2.7. <hi>And he brought up Hadaſſah, that is Esther;</hi> and becauſe he greatly favoured the Jews, as we ſee, Ezra 6.1. or elſe Xerxes the ſonne of Darius Hyſtaſpes, whoſe wife other Hiſtorians call Ameſtris, not much unlike Eſther; or elſe Artaxerxes Longimanus Xerxes ſonne, in whoſe dayes Nehemiah was ſent to Ieruſalem, ſee the note Neh. 2.6.</p>

in their ſeverall turns, that he might chooſe which he liked beſt to be his queen; ſo that it ſeems it was not long after that Vaſhti was put away, that is in ſome part of the fourth yeare of his reigne, when theſe things were done which are here next related; <hi>when the wrath of the king Ahaſuerus was appeaſed he remembred Vaſhti</hi> that is, he bethought himſelf what wrong he had done her, how farre that which ſhe had done was from deſerving ſo heavy a puniſhment as was inflicted on her, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what ſtraits he had brought himſelf by making a decree which could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed; and all this no doubt he remembred with much grief and anguiſh, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly vexed for what he had done, but not knowing how to help himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Then ſaid the kings ſervants, that miniſtred unto him, Let their be fair young virgins ſought for the king,</hi> &amp;c.] To drive theſe melancholy and ſad thoughts out of his mind, and to make him forget his forſaken Vaſhti, and withall leſt in further diſcontent he ſhould fall foul upon thoſe that had given him that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, they adviſed him to give order that out of the ſeverall provinces of his kingdome there ſhould be gathered a company of the moſt beautifull virgins they ſhould meet with, out of whom he might chooſe one whom he liked beſt, and make her his queen.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shuſhan the palace, to the houſe of the women, unto the custodie of Hege the kings chamberlain, keeper of the women.] The houſe of the women,</hi> was it ſeems divided into two parts: in the one were the virgins kept, which was therefore called the houſe under <hi>the cuſtody of Hege,</hi> verſ. 18. in the other were the concubines kept under the cuſtody of Shaaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaz another of the kings chamberlains; for after they had once lain with the king, they went no more to the houſe of the virgins, but were carried to the houſe of the concubines which was therefore called the ſecond houſe, verſ. 14. <hi>In the evening ſhe went, and on the morrow ſhe returned into the ſecond houſe of the women:</hi> but yet it ſeems this Hege, who had the ſpeciall cuſtodie of the virgins, had alſo the ſupreme government of the whole houſe, and Shaaſhbaz, was as it were under him; and therefore is he called, as here in generall, <hi>the keeper of the women.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6, <hi>Who had been carried away from Jeruſalem, with the captivitie which had been carried away with Jeconiah,</hi> &amp;c.] This muſt be underſtood of Kiſh Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decaies great grandfather; for it cannot well be underſtood of Mordecai himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the captivitie laſted ſeventy years ere Zerubbabel returned in the firſt yeare of Cyrus, and from Cyrus to Artaxerxes Longimanus, if he it be that is called Ahaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus, is accounted by the beſt Chronologers above ſeventy years; ſo that by this computation Mordecai muſt needs be one hundred and fifty yeare old at leaſt; and how then was Eſther his uncles daughter, a young beautifull virgin, and therefore choſen by the king to be his wife?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And he brought up Hadaſſah (that is Eſther) his uncles daughter.]</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſah was her own Hebrew name; and after ſhe was married to the king ſhe was called Eſther, and ſhe was Mordecaies couſin german, to wit, <hi>his uncles daughter,</hi> whoſe name was Abihail, verſ. 15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Esther was brought alſo unto the kings houſe.]</hi> Such was the tyrannous government of theſe Perſian kings, that whom his inſtruments would take away for the king, neither their parents nor friends might or could withſtand it; and ſo was Eſther among others carried away. See the note, verſ. 15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And the maiden pleaſed him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Hegai that had the keeping

                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Eſther had not ſhewed her people, nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe the Jews were in thoſe times a deſpiſed people; and therefore Mordecai feared ſhe might ſome way fare the worſe for that, if it were known of what nation ſhe was.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Whatever ſhe deſired was given her, to go with her out of the houſe of the women, unto the kings houſe.]</hi> That is, whatever any maiden that went to the king deſired, for the better adorning and tricking up of her ſelf, that ſhe might pleaſe the king when ſhe came to him, the order was that it muſt be given her; whether it were rich garments, jewells, chains, or any other ornaments.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>In the evening ſhe went, and on the morrow ſhe returned into the ſecond houſe of the women,</hi> &amp;c.] See the note above, verſ. 3.</p>

Others deſired to pleaſe, and therefore laboured by all means to make themſelves delightfull; but ſhe deſired it not, and therefore though happely ſhe reſiſted not ſo farre as ſhe ought to have done, yet ſhe abhorred all endeavouring to pleaſe; and ſo would onely be a patient in this buſineſſe, and accordingly through Gods grace and favour this ſhe obtained, that ſhe was not made his concubine but his wife.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And he made a releaſe to the provinces.]</hi> To wit, of the tribute which at that time was to have been paid: as princes at their great feaſts, ſuch as was this at Eſthers marriage, uſe to conferre ſome ſpeciall favours upon their people.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And when the virgins were gathered together the ſecond time,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of a ſecond gathering of the virgins after that before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either to attend at Eſthers marriage, or to provide concubines for the king. But it may as well I conceive, if not better, be underſtood of that gathering of the virgins hitherto ſpoken of, out of all the provinces for the chooſing of a wife in the room of Vaſhti: it ſeems when Vaſhti was choſen queen there was ſuch a ſearch made for many ſeverall beautifull virgins, of whom the king might chooſe her whom he liked beſt, and becauſe the ſame courſe was taken now again, when Vaſhti was put away, therefore it is ſaid here, <hi>When the virgins were gathered together the ſecond time,</hi> then Mordecai ſate in the kings gate, that is, he was one of the kings porters, or ſome other officer in the kings court, who uſually attended at the palace gate; or elſe it may be meant onely of his own voluntary attendance about the kings gate, that he might heare ſtill how it fared with Eſther; as before for the ſame reaſon he had ſtill attended before the court of the womens houſe, verſ. 11.</p>

Sam. 15.8.

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.]</hi> Two reaſons are given by Interpreters, why Mordecai refuſed to reverence Haman according to the kings commandment, and to bow down unto him as the other ſervants of the king: firſt, becauſe it was a divine worſhip which was enjoyned to be given him, which Mordecai therefore could not afford him without manifeſt contempt of Gods Law; and therefore Mordecai alledged that he was a Jew, verſ. 4. <hi>he told them he was a Jew.</hi> Manifeſt indeed it is by all that have written the ancient ſtories of the Perſians, that the Perſian kings did exact divine worſhip from the people, even to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as Gods, and ſo much is expreſſely noted of Darius, Dan. 6.7. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ask a petition of any, God or man, ſave of thee, O king, he ſhall be caſt into the den of lions:</hi> and hence they gather that this divine worſhip which they required, the king out of his exceſſive love to Haman, enjoyned to be given to him alſo; and indeed, the Apocryphall additions of Eſther, ſo farre as they deſerve credit, do plainly make this the cauſe of Mordecaies refuſing to bow unto Haman, chap. 13. verſ. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Thou knoweſt all things, and thou knoweſt Lord, that it was neither in contempt, nor pride, nor for any deſire of glory, that I did not bow down to proud Aman: for I could have been content with good will for the ſalvation of Iſrael to have kiſſed the ſoles of his feet; but I did this that I might not preferre the glory of man above the glory of God:</hi> ſecondly, becauſe he would not ſeem to flatter and magnifie him whom he abhorred in his heart, becauſe he was a proud ambitious, wicked, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wretch, and happely a profeſſed enemy of Gods people, and withall one of that accurſed nation, againſt whom the Jews were by the law bound to oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in perpetuall enmitie, Exod. 17, 16. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn that he will have warre with Amalek from generation to generation:</hi> Deut 25.17.19. <hi>Remember what Amalek did to thee by the way when thou cameſt forth out of Egypt, therefore it ſhall be when the Lord thy God hath given thee reſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou ſhalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven, thou ſhalt not forget it:</hi> and indeed this ſeems the cleareſt reaſon: for though Mordecai might have yielded reverence to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in civil reſpects upon the kings decree without any offence againſt God, yet what wonder that a good man ſhould ſcruple more then needed, or be tranſported by zeal to an unneceſſary endangering of himſelf, eſpecially if we conſider that Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai, that was of the tribe of Benjamin, might think how deare it coſt Saul for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour to Agag, of whoſe ſtock or nation Haman was: however doubtleſſe Mordecai would have ſcrupled as much the yielding of divine adoration to the king himſelf, as to his minion Haman: nor is it credible that Mordecai, Nehemiah, and the reſt that lived in the Perſian court, did never ſhew any reverence to the king of Perſia, no not ſo much as to ſtand up to them when they paſſed by; which Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai refuſed to do to Haman.

                     <pb n="798" facs="tcp:42229:408"/>Verſ. 4. <hi>They told Haman, to ſee whether Mordecai his matters would ſtand,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, to ſee whether he would ſtand to that he had done, and whether he could juſtifie and bear himſelf out in ſo doing, and the reaſon of this is given in the next words, <hi>for he had told them that he was a Jew;</hi> to wit, as rendring that for a reaſon, why he might not or would not bow down unto Haman; and that either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was divine worſhip which was to be given to Haman, which was directly contrary to the law God had given them; or becauſe he was an Amalekite, againſt whom the Jews were alwayes to be ſworn enemies, as is before noted verſ. 2. or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had alwayes been what he is called verſ. 10. <hi>the Jews enemy;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being a Jew, thought it not lawfull by bowing to him, to fawn upon him and flatter him.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Wherefore Haman ſought to destroy all the Jews,</hi> &amp;c.] Whereto he was incited, both by his former hatred happely againſt that nation; and his preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt Mordecai, for whoſe contempt no revenge ſeemed enough, and the conceit he might have, that the like contempt he muſt expect from all that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even becauſe of their religion.</p>

As for their caſting <hi>Pur, that is, the lot,</hi> it was by this lottery (which was a kind of Divination uſed in thoſe times) to find out what moneth or day would be lucky for the accompliſhment of his intended maſſacre of the Jews; and thus by the providence of God, over-ruling the ſuperſtition of this wicked wretch, there was way made for the preſervation of Gods people; for he caſting lots every day, day after day, and moneth after moneth, the lot diſcovering the lucky day, fell not till they came to the twelfth moneth, yea the thirteenth day of that moneth, verſ. 13. And hereupon though the decree he obtained from the king for the maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of the Jews were ſealed on the thirteenth day of the firſt moneth, verſ. 12. yet order was given that the maſſacre ſhould not be till the black-day (forſooth) came, to wit, the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth, verſ. 13. and before that day came, Mordecai was advanced and Haman hanged.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And Haman ſaid unto Ahaſuerus, There is a certain people ſcattered abroad,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the Jews were returned out of the captivity into the land of Judah, yet many of the ten tribes eſpecially did ſtill remain diſperſed here and there in ſeverall countries, not embracing the liberty which was proffered them; yea, what were the Jews in Judea but as a handfull of a poore diſperſed people, in regard of the Samaritanes and others that dwelt round about them in the province of Syria? and this Haman preſſeth that he might intimate to the king both the baſeneſſe of the people, and how eaſily they might be deſtroyed, and withall what danger there was of their infecting others with this their bold contempt of the kings laws, being a people ſcattered and diſperſed abroad in every countrey.</p>

Some underſtand that Haman meant that this great ſumme proffered ſhould be raiſed out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated ſtate of the Jews, that were to be ſlain; but I rather conceive it is meant of ſo much which ſhould have been paid out of his own ſtate; firſt, becauſe it is ſtill ſaid that Haman engaged himſelf to pay it for the deſtruction of the Jews, chap. 4.7. <hi>Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the ſumme that Haman had promiſed to pay to the kings treaſuries for the Jews, to deſtroy them:</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe the ſpoil of the Jews is afterward proffered as a prey to their neighbours in each place that ſhould deſtroy them, to make them the more willing to execute this cruell edict, verſ. 13. <hi>Letters were ſent by poſts into all the kings provinces, to deſtroy, to kill, and to cauſe to periſh all Jews, both young and old,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that he might therewith ſeal what decree he was pleaſed to make to this purpoſe; yea it may be that upon this occaſion he honoured him with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant keeping of this ſeal, for he kept it afterwards till he was caſhiered, c. 8.2. <hi>The king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the king and Haman ſate down to drink but the city Shuſhan was perplexed.]</hi> That is, the Jews in the city Shuſhan; and perhaps others alſo, as it muſt needs be, if they had any ſpark of humanity left in them, even out of pity and compaſſion, and withall too, for fear of the ordinary confuſions which are wont to happen in ſuch popular executions.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>ANd came even before the kings gate,</hi> &amp;c.] This Mordecai did, that he might give notice to Eſther what a decree was come forth concerning the Jews, and might adviſe her to interpoſe her ſelf for the preſervation of Gods people. But further then the kings gates he might not come, becauſe <hi>none might enter into the kings gate clothed with ſackcloth;</hi> the ground of which cuſtome we may conceive was, either that the court pleaſures might not be interrupted with any thing that had an appearance of ſorrow or ſadneſſe; or leſt the king ſhould be wonne ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, by beholding any ſuppliant ſo ſadly attired, to grant any thing that was not juſt and right.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>So Eſthers maids, and her chamberlains came and told it her.]</hi> To wit, how Mordecai ſate mourning before the kings gate in ſackcloth and aſhes and with his clothes rent, verſ. 1.2. for they could not tell her of that which is related
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:42229:409"/>
in the foregoing verſe, to wit, what wailing there was amongſt the Jews in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces abroad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhe ſent raiment to cloth Mordecai,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by way of comforting him; or that he might come into the court, yea happely that he might come to her and acquaint her with the cauſe of his ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he told Hatach, whom Eſther had ſent to him, how Haman had taken offence at him for not bowing to him, and how in his rage he had procured a decree for the deſtroying the whole nation of the Jews; which was doubtleſſe the more grievous to Mordecai, becauſe it proceeded from the rage of that proud wretch againſt him in particular.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And to charge her that ſhe ſhould go in unto the king,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in the name of Mordecai, whom ſhe ſtill reverenced as her foſter father, chap. 2.20. <hi>Eſther did the commandment of Mordecai like as when ſhe was brought up with him:</hi> and for a publick ſervice of Gods Church, notwithſtanding her greatneſſe, he doubted not to lay a charge upon her.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But I have not been called to come in unto the king, theſe thirty dayes.]</hi> This ſhe addes, as a ground of ſome fear leſt the kings affection toward her ſhould by ſome means be abated; and if ſo, her attempting to go in to the kings preſence without a call muſt needs be perillous.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>I alſo and my maidens will faſt likewiſe.]</hi> It is evident that on the third of the three dayes appointed for the faſt, chap. 5.1. Eſther laid by her mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning weeds, and put on her royall apparell, and feaſted the ſame day, verſ. 4, 5. both the king and Haman, and there is no doubt to be made, but that ſhe went in to the king ere the laſt of their faſting was ended, purpoſely that ſhe might then venture to go in to the king unſent for, when her brethren were imployed in faſting and prayer, to beg of God that the king might ſhew her favour. Either therefore this is meant onely, that as they faſted ſo would the likewiſe, and not that ſhe meant to faſt three entire nights and dayes as they ſhould; or elſe it muſt be ſaid, that as they, ſo ſhe likewiſe faſted three dayes, night and day, becauſe ſhe faſted three nights (for the Jews began their dayes at the evening) and part of the third day; much after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the time of Chriſts being in the grave, Matth. 12.40. Nor needs it ſeem ſtrange that ſhe undertakes for her maids, that they ſhould faſt likewiſe: for firſt, though they were before of an other religion, yet doubtleſſe ſhe did what ſhe might to inſtruct them in the knowledge of the true God: and ſecondly, partly by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at firſt with Hegai the kings chamberlain, chap. 2.8, 9. and partly by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect afforded her by all when ſhe was queen, ſhe might well have liberty to make choice of her own ſervants, and ſo might chooſe ſuch as were of the ſtock of the Jews.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>NOw it came to paſſe on the third day,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, of their faſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that day was fully ended (of which ſee the note in the foregoing chapter, verſ. 16.) <hi>She put on her royall apparell, and ſtood in the inner court of the kings houſe, over againſt the kings houſe.</hi> It ſeems at the entrance of the kings houſe there was ſome large and ſtately porch (ſuch as was Solomons porch of judgement, 1. Kings 7.7.) where <hi>the king ſate upon his royall throne</hi> (as it is here ſaid) and ſo by this means, as ſoon as Eſther was come into the inner court, and ſtood before the kings houſe, he preſently ſaw her, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>She obtained favour in his ſight; and the king held out to Eſther the golden ſceptre,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in token that he called her to come near to him, and conſequently had pardoned her coming in to the inner court, not being ſent for: and indeed conſidering what abſolute obedience the Perſian Monarchs required of their ſubjects to all their decrees, and that Vaſhti his former queen (whom happely he had formerly loved as well as Eſther) was caſt off for as ſmall an offence as this of Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers, and withall that it was above thirty dayes ſince Eſther was called in to the king (which was hinted, chap. 4.11. as ſome ground of fear, leſt the heat of the king to her began to abate) we may well think there was a ſpeciall hand of God in moving the kings heart to ſhew her favour, which was the gracious anſwer returned to his peoples faſting and prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So Eſther drew near, and touched the top of the ſceptre.]</hi> As happely the cuſtome was, and that as a ſign of reverence and ſubjection, and of her thankfull apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and embracing that favour he had now afforded her, by holding out that his ſceptre unto her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>What is thy request? it ſhall be even given thee, to the half of the kingdome.]</hi> This was it ſeems a proverbiall ſpeech, whereby in thoſe times princes uſed liberally to promiſe what ever ſhould be deſired, though not intending literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if they asked half of the kingdome it ſhould be given them. As we ſee in the promiſe of Herod to the daughter of Herodias, Mark 6.23. <hi>And he ſware unto her, whatſoever thou ſhalt ask of me I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.]</hi> Eſther ſhewed much wiſedome in deſiring that this favour might be done her, before ſhe made known the petition ſhe had to make unto the king: firſt, becauſe by her intended entertaining the king at a feaſt ſhe hoped his love might yet further be enflamed towards her: ſecondly, becauſe ſhe might not hold it ſo ſafe to diſcover at this time either her parentage or petition, when the king was attended with his nobles and courtiers, who out of their zeal to have the decrees of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians preſerved irrevocable, or in favour to Haman, might oppoſe her requeſt for the recalling of that decree concerning the Jews, which the king had made; but judged it more ſeaſonable to do this at a private banquet, where onely her own ſervants might be by to attend them: thirdly, becauſe Haman not being now preſent, what ſhe alledged againſt him might be preſently carried to him, and then he might have ſlipped away and hid himſelf: and fourthly, becauſe when men are merry and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick at feaſts, they uſed to be the freer to grant any boon to thoſe they affect. And ſo likewiſe it was politickly alſo done to invite Haman together with the king: firſt, that ſhe might to his face accuſe him (a good evidence that ſhe ſpake nothing but
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:42229:410"/>
truth) of the plot he had to take away her life, together with the reſt of her people: and ſecondly, that he might not privately by falſe ſuggeſtions diſſwade the king from believing her complaint.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the king ſaid unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition?]</hi> Anciently it ſeems, the meat being removed, they uſed to have a ſecond banquet of fruits and wines, which therefore they called <hi>the banquet of wine:</hi> for with their meat they drank wine mixed with water.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>My petition, and my requeſt is,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, my petition and requeſt for the preſent is onely this; that the king and Haman would yet once more come to morrow to a banquet which I ſhall prepare for them, and then <hi>I will do as the king hath ſaid,</hi> verſ. 8. that is, make known that great ſuit which I have unto the king. In this ſecond deferring the propounding her petition to the king, ſhe might have an aim to get the better hold of the king, by endearing him with ſo pleaſant entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to ripen her hopes by working in the mind of Ahaſuerus a fore-conceit of the greatneſſe and difficultie of that ſuit that was ſo hardly drawn forth. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, doubtleſſe God did by his ſecret providence incline her heart hereto, that in the interim he might advance Mordecai before her feaſt was prepared; and ſo ſhe might have the better aſſurance of obtaining her ſuit, both for the deliverance of the Jews, and the ruine of Haman, and Gods hand in the buſineſſe might be the, more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Verſ.. 9. <hi>When Haman ſaw Mordecai in the kings gate, that he ſtood not up, nor moved for him,</hi> &amp;c.] So farre was Mordecai from adoring Haman, or bowing down to him, as was enjoyned, that he would not ſo much as move to him when he went by. He might have heard how Eſther had found favour with the king, which might raiſe his courage to a more ſcornfull contempt of this his profeſſed adverſary; however, this makes it moſt probable that it was not divine adoration onely that he refuſed to yield him. See the note, chap. 3, 2.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, thereby to aggravate Mordecaies offence in daring for all this to deſpiſe him as he did.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow ſpeak thou unto the king, that Mordecai may be hanged thereon.]</hi> This in their pride and rage and ſervile ſtooping to Haman they adviſed him to do, not conſidering nor regarding the ſingular ſervice which Mordecai had done for king Ahaſuerus, chap. 2.21. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ON that night could not the king ſleep,</hi> &amp;c.] The kings head might perhaps be troubled with thinking what great requeſt it ſhould be that Eſther had to make, that was ſo hardly drawn from her; but doubtleſſe beſide, there was a ſpeciall hand of divine providence in keeping the king awake; for Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai might have been hanged before Eſther had known any thing of it. (Haman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come early the next morning, verſ. 4. to beg this of the king) had not the Lord kept him from ſleep, and directed him to reade in that place of the Chronicles where Mordecaies ſervice was recorded, and ſo made way to his advancement.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Then ſaid the kings ſervants that miniſtred unto him, There is nothing done for him.]</hi> Here it is ſaid expreſſely, that nothing had been done for Mordecai; yet we ſee what is ſaid in the Apocryphall additions, chap, 12. verſ. 5, 6. <hi>So the king commanded Mordocheus to ſerve in the court, and for this he rewarded him. Howbeit,
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:42229:410"/>
Aman the ſon of Amadatheus the Agagite, who was in great honour with the king, ſought to moleſt Mordocheus and his people, becauſe of the two Eunuchs of the kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And the king ſaid, Who is in the court,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in the outer court: for it was death for any body to come into the court, except he were called by name chap. 4.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now Haman was come into the outward court of the kings houſe, to ſpeak unto the king, to hang Mordecai,</hi> &amp;c.] Hereby it appears that it was towards day ere that was read to the king which Mordecai had done, whereupon followed that enquiry, what had been done for the honouring of the man that had done him ſuch good ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the king ſaid unto him. What ſhall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour?]</hi> Though the king knew of no difference betwixt Haman and Mordecai, yet he ſuppreſſed Mordecaies name; and thus the Lord by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence brought it about, that even Haman himſelf ſhould to his greater vexation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the honours that ſhould be done to Mordecai; and that at a time when he was come to deſire of the king that he might be hanged, and with full aſſurance that he ſhould have obtained his deſire.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Take the apparell and the horſe, as thou hast ſaid, and do even ſo to Mordecai.</hi> &amp;c.] Though the crown royall whereof Haman ſpake alſo, verſ. 8. be not here expreſſed by the king; yet it is implyed in the following words, where Haman is enjoyned to do to Mordecai juſt as he had ſaid, <hi>Let nothing fail of all that thou haſt ſpoken,</hi> if afterwards he wore a crown of gold, chap. 8.15. <hi>And Mordecai went out from the preſence of the king in royall apparell of blew and white, and with a great crown of gold,</hi> much more when he was carried in ſuch pomp through the city.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And proclaimed before him, Thus ſhall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.]</hi> That is, by Heraulds he cauſed it to be proclaimed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And Mordecai came again to the kings gate.]</hi> That is, having received that honour related in the former verſe, he returned to his ordinary office (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) and attendance at the kings gate, as not being puffed up herewith, nor yet rid of his fears, concerning that cruell decree for the maſſacre of the Jews, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how Eſther had ſped in her ſuit againſt Haman (though by this ſudden change he might hope that ſomething was done) and therefore deſirous ſtill to hearken what ſhould be the event of Eſthers petition to Ahaſuerus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Haman hasted to his houſe mourning, and having his head covered.]</hi> To wit, for ſhame and grief, becauſe that honour, which he was ſo confident ſhould have been conferred upon himſelf, was conferred upon his enemy, and himſelf was forced to be a chief actour therein. See 2. Sam. 15.30.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>If Mordecai be of the ſeed of the Jews, before whom thou hast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to fall, thou ſhalt not prevail,</hi> &amp;c.] This they conclude for certain, both becauſe they might well think, that Mordecai having thus gotten the ſtart of him, and being exalted above him, would be revenged on him (as favourites uſe to ſeek the ruine of thoſe that were favourites before them) becauſe he had plotted to deſtroy both him and all his people: and alſo becauſe what they had obſerved formerly concerning Gods miraculous pleading for his people againſt all their enemies, they ſaw now confirmed in this unexpected advancement of Mordecai, and might thence well gueſſe that God was now making way to the mine of Haman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="804" facs="tcp:42229:411"/>Verſ. 14. <hi>And while they were yet talking with him, came the kings cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains, and hasted to bring Haman,</hi> &amp;c.] If Harbonah mentioned, chap. 1.10, was one of theſe, no marvell though afterwards he told Ahaſuerus of the gallows that Haman had ſet up for Mordecai, ſince he might perhaps then ſee them at this his going to fetch Haman to Eſthers banquet.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>For we are ſold, I, and my people, to be deſtroyed,</hi> &amp;c.] She ſaith they were ſold, becauſe as thoſe things that are ſold are delivered over to the will and pleaſure of thoſe to whom they were ſold, ſo were they delivered over to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and pleaſure of their enemies; and withall becauſe there was a ſumme of money proffered to the king, even ten thouſand talents of ſilver, that they might be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the power of their enemies, that they might have free liberty to kill and deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if we had been ſold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe it would not have been ſo bad for them to be ſold for bondmen, as to have all their lives in an inſtant taken away without all hope of recovery; and withall, becauſe by their ſale and bondage, ſome profit might have redounded to the king (although indeed, as ſhe addes in the following words, the loſſe of the king in his tributes would have been ſo great, that nothing the enemy could have effected, no not by ſelling us for bondſlaves, could poſſibly have countervailed the kings dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage) but to be delivered up to be ſlain to our utter vaine, and without any ſhew of profit to the king (for the loſſe of ſo many uſefull and loyall ſubjects would have been an irrecoverable loſſe) this was moſt inſufferable.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And the king ariſing from the banquet of wine in his wrath, went into the palace garden.]</hi> As not able to endure the ſight of Haman, and therefore fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away in a chaſe, and ſo nettled with vexation and ſhame, that he had ſo raſhly ſuffered himſelf to be ſo abuſed, that he knew not where to reſt nor which way to turn himſelf, and withall that he might by himſelf deliberate what was fit to be done in this caſe.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ON that day did the king Ahaſuerus give the houſe of Haman the Jews enemy unto Eſther.]</hi> That is, his houſe together with all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and goods, whereof ere while he had ſo much boaſted, chap. 5.11. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forfeited to the king were at his diſpoſing, to be beſtowed on whomſoever it pleaſed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Mordecai came before the king,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he was called and choſen to be one of his continuall houſhold attendants, and taken into his eſpeciall favour; yea happely one of thoſe princes that ſaw the kings face, that is, that had alwayes free acceſſe into his preſence, chap. 1.14. and that becauſe he acknowledged him now to be his kinſman by his queen Eſther, as the words following do plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>for Eſther had told what he was to her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai.]</hi> Some conceive that this was not that ſeal wherewith the king uſed to ſeal the decrees which were ſent forth in his name (which for that onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſay they, he gave to Haman, chap. 3.10. &amp;c. and therefore no doubt had it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after that decree was ſealed) and this they held, becauſe there was not any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why that ſhould be now given to Mordecai: rather they judge that this was one of thoſe rings which were uſually given, as a mark of honour, to thoſe that were the chief princes and counſellours of ſtate about the king; which having been formerly given to Haman was taken from him when he was condemned to death, and given now to Mordecai: but becauſe the text ſpeaks plainly of one ſpecial ring, <hi>the king took off his ring,</hi> &amp;c. I rather think that this was that very ring before ſpoken of, chap. 3.10. and that Mordecai was now made keeper of the kings ſignet, as Haman had been; whence it was that he wore thoſe badges of honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſ. 15. <hi>And Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai went out from the preſence of the king in royall apparell of blew and white, and with a crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen, and purple,</hi> &amp;c. and that he is ſaid to have been <hi>great in the kings houſe,</hi> chap 9.4. <hi>and next unto him king A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus,</hi> chap. 10.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Esther ſet Mordecai over the houſe of Haman.]</hi> That is, ſhe committed
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:42229:412"/>
it, and all he had to Mordecaies care and charge, to be by him diſpoſed and ordered as might be for her beſt advantage.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Let it be written to reverſe the letters deviſed by Haman,</hi> &amp;c.] Eſther wiſely, would not take any notice of the kings conſenting to this bloudy decree, leſt ſhe ſhould ſeem to caſt the leaſt blame upon him; and withall ſhe knew well that a decree eſtabliſhed by the king, by the Laws of the Perſians, might not be reverſed, Dan. 6.—15. <hi>The Law of the Medes and Perſians is, that no decree nor ſtatute which the king establiſheth may be changed:</hi> and therefore to give him a hint to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it, as a decree deviſed by Haman, and ſurreptitiouſly written and ſealed, and ſent forth by him; ſhe makes no mention at all of the king, but calls them letters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by Haman, which he wrote to deſtroy the Jews.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>I have given Eſther the houſe of Haman, and him they have hanged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gallows, becauſe he laid his hand upon the Jews.]</hi> That is, he intended and endeavoured ſo to do: having aſſigned a decree to have them all ſlain.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Write ye alſo for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the kings name, and ſeal it with the kings ring,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems the king would not pretend that the former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were deviſed by Haman without this direction, becauſe he knew to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor could yield to the reverſing of the former decree, which was againſt the law and cuſtome of the Medes and Perſians; but let them write what they could deviſe in favour of the Jews, and for their preſervation, ſo the former decree were not in expreſſe terms reverſed, he conſented freely to it: and indeed that this was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this which the king here ſaid, we may the rather think, becauſe in the new decree which Mordecai ſent forth, verſ. 11. no man is forbidden to offer violence to the Jews, nor is the magiſtrate commanded to aſſiſt them, onely the Jews are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtand upon their guard; which ſhews that Mordecai was reſtrained to this, that he might not in expreſſe terms reverſe what was publiſhed in the former decree.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then were the kings ſcribes called at that time in the third moneth (that is, the moneth Sivan)</hi> &amp;c.] Which containeth part of <hi>May</hi> and part of <hi>June.</hi> The decree for the ſlaying of the Jews was made on the thirteenth day of the firſt moneth, chap. 3.12. ſo that this calling of the kings ſcribes to make a new decree, was two moneths and ten dayes after the former decree was made; all which time we may well imagine that the people of God were in a very ſad condition; but yet their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight moneths and twenty dayes ſtill behind, ere the day at firſt appointed for the ſlaughter of the Jews ſhould come, to wit, the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth, all this time they had to provide for their own defence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was written (according to all that Mordecai commanded) unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants,</hi> &amp;c.] To the Jews, becauſe it concerned their ſecuritie; and to the governours, that they might publiſh it, and not hinder the Jews in their juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And whereas it is ſaid that this decree was ſent to every province, <hi>according to the writing thereof,</hi> for this, ſee chap. 1.22.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>To gather themſelves together, and to ſtand for their life, to destroy, to ſlay,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus by the former decree ſtanding ſtill in force, the nations of each province were authorized to deſtroy the Jews; and by this ſecond edict the Jews were authorized to deſtroy thoſe that ſhould ſet upon them, which the Jews, being but a few in compariſon of thoſe they lived amongſt, could have never done by their own ſtrength, had not this diſcovery of the change of the kings mind, and this inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:42229:412"/>
of his deſire much abated the malice of their enemies; yea, had not God miraculouſly proſpered this weak means for their preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the decree was given at Shuſhan the palace.]</hi> That is, there it was dated ſigned and ſealed; and then afterwards there, as in other places, it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and proclaimed.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the citie of Shuſhan rejoyced and was glad.]</hi> See the note, chap. 3.15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>The Jews had light and gladneſſe, and joy and honour.]</hi> Light may be here ſet againſt the darkneſſe of affliction, as gladneſſe againſt ſorrow; or elſe gladneſſe joy and honour may be added to explain what was meant by light; of which, ſee the note 2. Sam. 22.29.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.]</hi> They became proſelytes, and conformed themſelves to the Jewiſh religion: ſome perhaps ſeriouſly, as being wonderfully affected with this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous manifeſtation of Gods watchfull providence over this people, whom they did now therefore fear and reverence, as the Lord of heavens darling people; but others again fainedly, and with a diſſembling heart, merely to curry favour with Eſther, Mordecai, and the reſt of the Jews, and for fear they ſhould deſtroy them by warrant of that new decree which was now come forth.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>IN the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, though it was turned to the contrary,</hi> &amp;c.] This is noted to ſhew how falſe and deceitfull the lots which Haman caſt proved in the concluſion; that day which was deſigned as the onely lucky day for the maſſacre of the Jews proved quite contrary, a happy day to them, and fatall to their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And no man could withſtand them: for the fear of them fell upon all people.]</hi> Hereby it appears that on the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth the enemies of the Jews in ſeverall places, yea, even in the citie of Shuſhan it ſelf, where Ahaſuerus lived verſ. 6. took up arms, and went about to maſſacre the Jews, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſentence of the firſt decree, chap. 3.13. notwithſtanding the ſecond decree that was ſent out after it, chap. 8.10, 11. wherein the Jews were allowed to gather themſelves together and to deſtroy all thoſe that ſhould ſet upon them. Eſther there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they took this ſecond edict to be a reverſing of the firſt, which was againſt the laws of the Medes and Perſians chap. 8.8. and therefore they were enraged at it, and would not obey it; or elſe, happely they did not believe that this ſecond edict was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſent forth by the king, but was onely the device of Mordecai, or at leaſt would not believe it, as being loth to be beaten off from deſtroying the Jews, whom they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a deadly hatred, and had long aſſured themſelves that they ſhould now have liberty to wreak their teen upon them, and therefore were reſolved to put in execution the firſt decree: now herein was the wonder, that the Jews being a few to ſpeak of, ſhould be able to ſtand againſt their enemies; but the reaſon of this is given, that God ſtruck their enemies with ſuch terrours &amp; fears, that they were not able to withſtand them. The rulers for fear helped the Jews, verſ. 3. many others no doubt durſt not ſtirre, and thoſe that had with great confidence armed themſelves, when the Jews aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelves and ſtood for their lives, vvere ſuddenly daunted, and ſo eaſily ſlain by the Jevvs; and thus God did immediatly, more for the preſervation of the Jevvs by making them terrible to their enemies, then all that Eſther and Mordecai had done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="808" facs="tcp:42229:413"/>Verſ. 6. <hi>And in Shuſhan the palace the Jews ſlew and deſtroyed five hundred men.]</hi> It is above all ſtrange, that in Shuſhan the city royall, called here Shuſhan the palace, where the kings favour to Mordecai and the reſt of the Jews could not be unknown, there ſhould be ſo many found, that would obſtinately undertake the maſſacring of the Jews, in confidence of the firſt decree, chap. 3.13. notwithſtanding by the ſecond decree, chap. 8.10.11. the Jews were allowed to kill and deſtroy all their enemies that ſhould ſet upon them. But for this we muſt conſider, firſt, that when wicked men are hardened of God that they may be deſtroyed, they do uſually thus violently ruſh upon their own ruine, the vengeance of God not ſuffering them to reſt: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in likelihood there were many of the faction of Haman, that being enraged with the death of their great lord, and the ſudden preferment of Mordecai, were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinouſly inclined, and ready enough therefore to be ſtirred up to this attempt by Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ten ſonnes, that were ringleaders to the reſt, as by their death is evident.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>The ten ſonnes of Haman the ſonne of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, ſlew they.]</hi> To wit, thoſe before mentioned by name in the three foregoing verſes (for by Hamans boaſting of the multitude of his children, chap. 5.11. <hi>And Haman told them of the multitude of his children,</hi> it may ſeem he had more beſide theſe: how this agrees with the Apocryphall additions of Eſther, we may ſee, chap. 16.18. where it is ſaid, that in the decree, by warrant whereof the Jews did now ſlay their enemies, there was mention made that not Haman onely, but alſo all his family with him were then hanged already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But on the ſpoil laid they not their hand.]</hi> Though by the kings decree they might have done it, chap. 8.11. <hi>Take the ſpoil of them for a prey:</hi> and that becauſe they would hereby make it evident, that they aimed not at the enriching of themſelves with the ſpoils of thoſe they had ſlain, but only at their own neceſſary and juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and that it might not be ſaid, that they had ſlain any one cauſeleſſely onely to get his eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>On that day, the number of thoſe that were ſlain in Shuſhan the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, was brought before the king.]</hi> The report of this which had happened in the city, was ſoon brought unto the king, perhaps by ſome that would willingly have ſtirred up the kings wrath againſt the Jews.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shuſhan, to do to morrow alſo according to this dayes decree.]</hi> To wit, by ſlaying thoſe who this day ſet upon the Jews, but eſcaped their hands and were not ſlain by them, as theſe five hundred were. And this no doubt ſhe deſired, as aiming at Gods glory in the revenge of his peoples enemies, and at the peace of the Church, which might elſe afterwards be diſturbed by theſe that were now for the preſent eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And let Hamans ten ſonnes be hanged upon the gallows.]</hi> That is, let the dead bodies of theſe ſonnes of Haman, who were this day ſlain with others, be for their greater reproch and the terrour of others, hanged upon the gallows whereon their father was before hanged.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>But they laid not their hands on the prey.]</hi> See above verſ. 10.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>On the thirteenth day of the moneth Adar,</hi> &amp;c.] The drift of the words in the three following verſes is to ſhew, that the other Jews that lived not at Shuſhan ſlew their enemies on the thirteenth day, and then reſted and kept a day of feaſting on the fourteenth day, whereas the Jews at Shuſhan ſlew their enemies both
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:42229:413"/>
on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. dayes, and ſo kept not their day of feaſting till the fifteenth day.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And Mordecai wrote theſe things, and ſent letters unto all the Jews,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in the writings and letters which he ſent unto the Jews concerning their kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the feaſt of Purim, he wrote the relation of theſe things before mentioned, as the ground of this annuall feſtivity; or elſe it may be meant more generally, that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai was the pen-man of the holy ghoſt, in writing this whole book of Eſther.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>To ſtabliſh this among them, that they ſhould keep the fourteenth day of the moneth Adar, and the fifteenth,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe on the fourteenth day the countrey Jews reſted from ſlaying their enemies, and thoſe in Shuſhan not till the fifteenth; and ſo they were taught to rejoyce in one anothers welfare. But was not this unlawfull like that ſin of Jeroboams, 1. Kings 12.33. I anſwer, No, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a politick ordinance for civill reſpects, and not any addition to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Dayes of feaſting and joy and of ſending portions one to another, and gifts to the poore.]</hi> As their cuſtome was in all their ſolemn feſtivities, Neh. 8.10. <hi>Then he ſaid unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the ſweet, and ſend portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had ſeen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them</hi> &amp;c.] This clauſe is added, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe things related in theſe letters, concerning the danger the Jews were in, and their deliverance from that danger, which moved them to take upon them to keep the feaſt of Purim: ſome of them they had ſeen with their own eyes in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall dwellings (as the decree that was brought from the king for the deſtroying of the Jews, and the preparations that were made by the enemies, to put this decree in execution; and the ſecond decree likewiſe, wherein the Jews were allowed to defend themſelves, and to ſlay their enemies, and the ſlaughter which thereupon they had made amongſt them) and again ſome other things had been onely brought unto them by relation from others as Hamans caſting of lots, and many others of the like nature.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>Then Esther the queen the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote,</hi> &amp;c.] the former letters whereby the Jews were in all places appointed to keep yearly the feaſt of Purim, on the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the moneth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, in memory of this great deliverance were written by Mordecai, verſ. 20. and therefore was that feſtivall uſually afterwards amongſt the Jews called Mordecaies day, 2. Maccha. 15.36. but then afterwards again perhaps the next yeare, leſt they ſhould not hold on in the yearely obſerving this feaſt, as fearing leſt the celebration hereof ſhould embitter the minds of the people againſt them, amongſt whom they lived, by renewing the memory of that great ſlaughter which the Jews had made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, Eſther alſo now with Mordecai wrote a ſecond letter to enjoyn the continuance of this anniverſary feaſt, and that <hi>with all authority;</hi> urging it by all means, and ſtrictly enjoyning it as farre as by their authority they might, the better <hi>to confirm this ſecond letter,</hi> and that there might be no queſtion made of doing what was therein ſo ſtrictly and firmly enjoyned.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And he ſent the letters unto all the Jews,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with words of peace and truth.]</hi> The meaning of this clauſe is, either that in theſe letters he did enjoyn them to live peaceably amongſt themſelves, and with others alſo, and not to inſult over the nations becauſe of their own preſent proſperity; or elſe that he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:42229:414"/>
or encourage them, by giving them aſſurance that they ſhould enjoy peace and truth, and putting them out of doubt and fear.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And as they had decreed for themſelves and for their ſeed, the matter of the fastings and their cry.]</hi> Severall wayes is this underſtood by Expoſitours. For firſt, ſome underſtand it as in relation to their faſting and praying three dayes together, when Eſther was to go in to Ahaſuerus to make ſupplication for the Jews, chap. 4.16. to wit, that as then in their great danger, Eſther and Mordecai appointed them certain dayes for faſting and prayer with ſtrong cryes and tears, ſo now they appointed certain dayes of yearely praiſe and thankſgiving for their great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Secondly, ſome underſtand it thus, that as they had decreed for themſelves and their poſterity, that the thirteenth day of the moneth Adar ſhould for ever be kept as a faſting day, in remembrance of their faſting, when Haman had procured his bloudy decree againſt them, ſo they decreed likewiſe to keep the fourteenth and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth dayes, as dayes of feaſting, in memory of their miraculous deliverance from that decree. And thirdly, others take it thus, that as they had formerly decreed for themſelves and their poſterity to keep certain dayes of publick humiliation with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer, in remembrance of the deſolation of Jeruſalem, when the city was taken, and the Temple burnt by the Babylonians, which were thoſe whereof the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Zachary ſpeaks, Zach. 7.5. <hi>When ye faſted and mourned in the fifth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth moneth, even thoſe ſeventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even unto me?</hi> ſo now it was decreed, that they ſhould for ever keep this feaſt of Purim in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their joyfull deliverance from the plot of Haman. And indeed, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the text here ſpeaks of faſts decreed for all the Jews and their poſterity, and that faſt deſired by Eſther, chap. 4.16. was onely kept in Shuſhan. And ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find it not in the ſtory any where, that there was a faſt for ever kept on the thirteenth day in memoriall of that faſt (and indeed, that they kept a faſt in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a faſt, or a danger from which they were delivered, ſeems not probable) therefore the laſt Expoſition is I conceive moſt ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>And the decree of Eſther confirmed theſe matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.]</hi> That is, in the book of their publick acts, or the book of their civill ſtatutes and ordinances, beſides thoſe of Moſes laws.</p>
